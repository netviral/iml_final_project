"Curfews are a useful and often necessary tool to help keep teenagers out of trouble. They provide an invaluable element of safety for teens of all ages, allowing parents to better ensure their children come home safe and on time. However, curfews can also be seen as unfairly limiting the lives of young people, limiting or prohibiting their access to certain crucial social activities or experiences. 

On one hand, a strict curfew enforced in a household can be beneficial in many ways. It allows parents to have a sense of control over their children and can help to keep them out of situations that could be unhealthy or even dangerous. It also provides a space for teenagers to all have the same level of respect for safety and responsibility that can help to lower the risk of involvement in criminal activities. 

On the other hand, curfews can also be restrictive for young people, limiting their ability to make their own decisions and explore the world around them. Some teens may feel overprotected or limited in their access to certain places or experiences. Parents should be mindful of their children’s needs and try to provide a balance between safety and freedom. 

Overall, curfews are necessary to ensure the safety of teenagers in many households. However, they should also be used thoughtfully. Parents should be certain to provide their children with enough freedom to explore and find their own identity, while still keeping the lines of communication and trust open at all times. With a sensible curfew system in place, teens can be given the opportunity to act responsibly and benefit from both safety and freedom.",1
"When it comes to customer service, an often overlooked aspect is the importance of public relations. Public relations are the means by which businesses communicate with their customers, stakeholders and community. Touching on topics such as news coverage, social media presence and reputation management, public relations have a major role in making sure that a business has a positive image. One way in which companies can ensure good public perception is through careful crafting of press releases and other correspondence that goes out to news outlets or publications. It's essential for these pieces to be well-written so as not to appear too biased or slanted towards the company itself; instead they should strive for accuracy and clarity in order to reflect positively on the business' activities and values. Additionally, press releases should feature quotes from experts within the industry or related fields who can attest to its expertise—providing further credibility for any claims made regarding product quality or reliability. Social media also plays an increasingly important role when it comes to maintaining strong customer relationships with existing clients while drawing potential ones into the fold; having an active online presence allows businesses greater control over how they're perceived publicly since many users rely heavily upon user-generated reviews when researching brands before purchasing products/services from them. As such, keeping up-to-date with trends found on popular platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook is paramount if one wants their business’s profile (and thus customer base) grow consistently over time. Many companies have even gone so far as creating separate accounts specifically dedicated solely towards responding directly to customer feedback either negative or positive – allowing them more insight into what works best for their particular brand identity given current market conditions & demographics being targeted at any given moment. . . Finally no discussion about PR would be complete without mentioning reputation management: this entails protecting your name & brand from any malicious actors who might wish harm upon you/your organization via false reports/reviews spread across various channels throughout cyberspace . Negativity spreads",1
"The renowned British statesman Winston Churchill once famously said that “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” His words express a powerful idea: that failure is essential for success. This notion is particularly relevant in our modern lives, where every day we set ourselves goals and strive for success in all aspects of our lives. In order for us to reach our goals, it is inevitable that we will experience failure along the way. This should be embraced, rather than feared, as failure often gives us insight and teaches us valuable lessons. We should use this knowledge to help power us towards our ultimate goals. 

The key to maintaining enthusiasm throughout this process is to remain optimistic and focus on our progress. With each failure, we gain more experience and knowledge which can be used on our journey to success. Viewing failure in a positive light allows us to stay motivated and benefit from the lessons learned. Having a strong mindset and the right attitude can be the difference between succeeding and throwing in the towel. 

Winston Churchill’s quote encapsulates the idea that it is possible to utilize failure to propel us towards our desired outcomes. By keeping our enthusiasm alive and staying optimistic, we set ourselves up for achieving our greatest successes.",1
"Everyone assumes that the best way of transportation is by a car. Teenagers dream of getting their license on their sixteenth birthday and maybe even getting a car. Most adults use cars to get to and from work, drive their kids around and do fun activities. But what people don't understand is that there are so many other alternatives that ultimately result in a happier and healthier planet. There are so many downfall with driving and owning a car that many are now believing that it is much more reasonable to just not own a car.

When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way Rosenthal, line 6. Having cars stress people out and people don't even realize this. There are so many responsibilities that come with driving. No one enjoys sitting in long traffic jams. It is annoying and quite bothersome. Everyone gets so frustrated, nevermind the amounts of accidents that lead to injury and death from it all.

In Colombia there is a day once a year in which cars can not go on the road or they are served with a fine. This effort is to try to bring stress levels down and stop air pollution. Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily and devoid of traffic jams Selsky, line 23. This idea promoted excessive and got people out and doing things in the community. The citizens clearly were not against this day or else they wouldn't have been active. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city Selsky, line 28. This just goes to show what driving does. It isolates people. Without all the cars, one is more willing to spend time outside and interacting with other people and since people were out and about more and enjoying the community, the area has gotten more presentable and pleasurable to be in. ...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Selsky, line 29. Officals and shop owners are making more of an effort because everyone is more active and caring.

In Paris, the officals made an effort to try and clean up the cities pollution rates. They assigned a day where even number licensed plates could not be on the road and a day for odd numbered plate cannot be on the road or else they will be fined. Congestion was down 60 percent Duffer, 14. If anything, it goes to show that the amount of cars on the road is absurb. 60 percent is more than half, that's a lot of traffic. Paris primarily uses diesel, causeing a lot more pollution in this busy city. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals Duffer, line 17. Paris is a very touristy area and people go in hopes to see a beautiful city. This project went so well that officals planned to continue it. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. Duffer, line 19. If officals planned to continue this idea, than it must be benifical in some way. If citizens just made an effort to not drive everywhere, than restrictions would not have to be mad. It's because of the amount of driving that is going on that officals have to get involved.

...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions... Rosenthal, line 37 Motor vehicals cause so much danger to Earth. The amount of pollution is so high and dengerous. It is much easier to prevent than everyone believes. One could simply take the bus, ride a bike, only drive to work and needed places, walk, and even car pool. There are an abundant amount of ways to prevent so much pollution and stress. It's all over the world that this is an issue Paris, Colombia, the United States, and many other places. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.  Rosenthal, line 11. That is a lot. It isn't difficult to help prevent this.

In the long run, not driving would result in happier people anyways. Cars are so expensive that is would cause less aggravation and economic stress as well as the basic stress of just driving and being in traffic. Society could make the world so much cleaner and safer for the next generations. It starts now. Get a bike or a pair of walking shoes and start getting active in the community. Start making the changes now so it isn't forced by officals later. make the effort and show the next generations how life should be. This could lead to a much happier and healthier life style.",0
"Support for the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States' presidential elections. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers several benefits that ensure a fair and balanced representation of the American people.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote while only obtaining 51.3% of the popular vote. This indicates that the Electoral College aligns the interests of the states and prevents a few densely populated areas from dominating the entire election process. With the current system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear result and avoiding disputes over the outcome.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that a candidate cannot rely solely on the support of one particular region and must consider the interests of the entire nation. This ensures that the elected president represents the diverse needs and concerns of citizens from different regions, preventing a regional favorite from neglecting the interests of other parts of the country.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Swing states play a crucial role in election outcomes as they receive the most attention and information from candidates, resulting in more thoughtful and informed voters. This system ensures that candidates have a genuine interest in engaging with and addressing the concerns of swing state voters, ultimately improving the overall quality of the campaign.

The Electoral College also preserves the weight of larger states in the political balance. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, already favors smaller states. By considering both population and state size, the Electoral College balances the representation of both large and small states. This way, presidential candidates are incentivized to pay attention to the needs and concerns of both populous states like Florida and smaller states like Wyoming, ensuring a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for complicated run-off elections. Under this system, a candidate who wins the majority of electoral votes becomes the clear winner, eliminating the need for further rounds of voting. This prevents political instability and ensures a smooth transition of power.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the numbers from the 2012 election indicate that eligible American voters are motivated to express their political preferences regardless of the impact on the national outcome. The Electoral College system has not hindered citizen participation in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers several advantages that promote a fair and balanced presidential election. It ensures a clear outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, balances representation between large and small states, and avoids the complexity of run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system in our country. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator, I wish to ask you a favor of keeping the Electoral College or changeing to election by popular vote for the presdent of the United States. First of all, the reason that I want to ask you this is because Most states have a winner take all system that they give to the winning president.

Next, after presidential election, the governor prepares a Certificate of Ascetainnent. listing all of the presidents who ran for president. after the presidental election is heild every four years on a tusedayafter the first monday in vovember. you help chose your states electors.

Furthormore, People should vote for a state of several Democratic electors pledged . On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election. oh yea and senitor under the eletoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president .

Finally, Fromm my opinion the presidental party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However, it is entirerly possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not winthe nactional popular vote.

So Mr. senator sir im only asking you this one thing if u coud just keep the Electoral college or changing to election vote for the president of the United States. pleez thats all im asking from you to  do for me just one thing. quite sime thing to do right ..",0
"I strongly disagree with the notion that educators should have complete control over the curriculum and that students should simply study what is presented to them. While it is true that educators have a duty to provide a comprehensive and rigorous education, it is equally important to consider the needs and interests of the students they are serving. In this essay, I will argue that a student-centered approach to curriculum design is critical for fostering engagement, motivation, and lifelong learning.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that every student has unique strengths, weaknesses, and interests. A one-size-fits-all curriculum does not take these differences into account, leading to disengagement, frustration, and a lack of motivation. By involving students in the curriculum design process, educators can gain valuable insight into the topics and activities that are most relevant and engaging for their students. This can help to create a more personalized learning experience that meets the needs of each student and fosters a love of learning.

For example, imagine a high school biology class in which the teacher decides to spend several weeks discussing plant physiology. While this may be interesting to some students, others may find it dull and irrelevant to their interests and career goals. By involving students in the curriculum design process, the teacher could identify topics that are more relevant and interesting to their students, such as human anatomy or genetics. This would not only increase engagement and motivation but also help students to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Furthermore, involving students in the curriculum design process can help to promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When students are given the opportunity to provide input into the curriculum, they are encouraged to think about what they want to learn and why. This can help to develop their analytical skills and promote curiosity, which are essential for success in higher education and the workforce.

For instance, imagine a middle school social studies class in which students are asked to design a research project on a topic of their choice related to American history. This could include topics such as the Civil Rights movement, the American Revolution, or the Industrial Revolution. By giving students the opportunity to select their own research topics, the teacher is encouraging them to think critically about historical events and how they relate to their own lives. This not only promotes analytical skills but also helps students to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Finally, involving students in the curriculum design process can help to promote a positive classroom culture and foster a sense of community. When students feel that their voices are heard and that their opinions matter, they are more likely to feel invested in their education and motivated to succeed. This can lead to a more positive and supportive classroom environment, which can have a significant impact on student achievement and well-being.

In conclusion, while it is important for educators to provide a comprehensive and rigorous curriculum, it is equally important to involve students in the curriculum design process. By doing so, educators can create a more personalized learning experience that meets the needs of each student and fosters engagement, motivation, and critical thinking skills. Furthermore, involving students in the curriculum design process can promote a positive classroom culture and foster a sense of community, which can have a significant impact on student achievement and well-being. Therefore, educators should strive to create a student-centered approach to curriculum design that takes into account the unique needs and interests of each student.",1
"Bang! a crash of thunder and I awake from a horrible dream, sweat trickling down my forehead. With my knees trembling, I sulk to the bathroom to cure my dry mouth, murmuring under my breath never to take only one persons advice ever again. When I was younger I asked my friend for advice on what fun games to play at my birthday party, she recommended a few spooky games that I was not so sure about and my other friend was frightfully disagreeing. I finally gave in thinking people would have more fun, but everyone, including my friend, got scared and we had to cut the eerie games short and my birthday was ruined. That night I had a nightmare about it and vowed always to ask more than one person their opinions and advice on such a matter. Having more than one person give you their advice is important because not everyone's ideas are going to be the best option, everyone's opinions are going to be based off of their experiences so finding someone with little or no experience in what you are trying to ask can change the whole situation, and if you go to someone not as personal to you they may not put forth as much effort to give you their best advice.

As you heard from my horrific story, not everyone's ideas are going to be fit for you and you have to be patient and take your time to find the really best option. Just because an idea sounds cool doesn't mean it's going to turn out the way you hope. What my mother tells me and your mother probably told you is that, If someone jumps off a bridge, you would do it too? What they're telling us is if someone says it would be a moment to remember if you guys jumped off a cliff, just think how great that idea really sounds and where you'll end up. I'll wait as long as you need. Are you ready? The hospital, that's where you'll end up, or worse! How does that life changing adventure sound now? Still wanna jump off a cliff? No? Your welcome.

Did I have any experience in those heart-stopping games? No. Did I listen to someone who had no experience in those regretful activities? Yes. Should I have listened to more people who had experience in that area of witch craft? Absolutely! Now that I am older I know that what we did was not that scary and wasn't even haunting but I sure regret ruining my once exciting birthday party. If you are in desperate need for advice go to someone with experience and not someone who doesn't even know what a ghost is. Let's say my friend who was opposing to the idea did have a say in the matter, I would have a much more pleasing party and all the kids wouldn't be sent home with their nails digging into their parents' arms. One wrong statement can change the whole situation and one pleasing eight year old appropriate idea can save parties.

Finding someone who cares about you can also affect the situation. If someone cares about you than they will think more about it and give you their best possible opinion. If you go up to someone you're not as close with or not fond of they won't put in any effort to make sure their option is safe or won't even give you their opinion. Years later and my friend that suggested that dreadful idea and I have drifted apart like a broken magnet and if we were close enough than maybe we wouldn't have gone our separate ways and she would've given me a less spine-chilling idea for my birthday party.

My nightmares are no more but my regret is still there popping up every once in a while to remind me to not make the same mistakes I made back then. To make better decisions in the future I will(and you should too) find the best option that is right for me, find someone with experience in what I am asking for, and ask a friend not a foe. Trust me, ask around, don't agree with anything you might regret. Take my advice, or don't, or multiple, just pick the one that's right for you.",0
"Young people should be encouraged to pursue long-term, realistic goals rather than seek immediate fame and recognition. I agree with this statement wholeheartedly. In an age that is saturated with instant gratification and the need for immediate success, our youth can often become overwhelmed and lost in the quest for recognition and fame. But, in order to reach true success, it is important to focus on realistic goals and long-term pursuits.

The first reason why it is important to encourage young people to pursue long-term, realistic goals is that it helps them to grow and develop as individuals. When goals are set with a long-term outlook, individuals are able to measure progress over a longer period of time and get a sense of satisfaction with results that are not immediate. This encourages a sense of perseverance and resilience in the face of challenges and setbacks, which can help youth to develop key skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and self-advocacy. Developing these skills is essential for young people to achieve success in the future, regardless of their chosen field of study or career.

The second reason why it is important to focus on long-term, realistic goals is that it can help young people to stay motivated and engaged in their pursuits. By setting achievable goals, young people can measure their successes and celebrate small victories along the way. This can help them to stay motivated and build confidence in their abilities. Additionally, the challenge of pursuing long-term goals can help to keep young people engaged and interested in their pursuits, as they are able to see the progress they are making over time and become inspired to continue striving for success.

Finally, it is important to encourage young people to pursue long-term, realistic goals because it can help them to prepare for success in the future. By having a focus on long-term goals, youth can develop key skills such as time management and planning, which are essential for achieving success in the future. Additionally, by having a focus on realistic goals, young people can develop a strong foundation of skills and experiences that can help them to succeed in the future.

In conclusion, I believe that it is essential to encourage young people to pursue long-term, realistic goals rather than seek immediate fame and recognition. Not only does this help them to grow and develop as individuals, but it can also help them to stay motivated and engaged in their pursuits. Additionally, it can help them to prepare for success in the future. Ultimately, by having a focus on long-term, realistic goals, young people can reach true success and achieve their dreams.",1
"Working alone has many benefits that may be overlooked when compared to working in a group. For starters, working alone can help to echo back and refresh knowledge by teaching yourself through your own projects. When working alone, one has more time to gain insight and understanding as there is no need to engage with others, allowing you to focus on the goal. Furthermore, when working alone, there is no need to compromise in order to accommodate opinions of others. This freedom allows you to push your boundaries and be creative as you see fit. Success outcomes are more likely to be achieved when working alone as there is no getting caught up in unnecessary arguments or delayed decision making. Moreover, there is no need to share ideas or credit, as all ownership remains solely yours. Finally, working alone helps increase confidence as you are solely responsible for the outcome of the project and can measure your own capabilities.

When we consider the advantages of working alone, it is clear that it can provide great value when it comes to developing knowledge and understanding, as well as leading to success.",1
"Is it possible that the face on Mars could have been created by aliens? Some people believe that the Face on Mars was formed by aliens; however,

I do not believe that is possible. A few of the pictures taken of the Face on Mars were taken when it was cloudy,but that is the only information that suggests that aliens could have made the face. Many scientists have done extensive research on the Face on Mars, and they have found that it is nothing more than a natural landform in the shape of a face. If you believe aliens formed the face on Mars, then be prepared for multiple facts that go against that belief.

Numerous scientists have studied the area in which the surreal face formation is located, and they have found various mesas. Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the place in which you would find the face. Because of these facts, it is believed that the Face on Mars is just another Martian mesa that is coincidently shaped like a face. NASA even captioned one of the pictures saying Huge rock formation that was formed by shadows, giving the illusion of a face. This explanation makes a tremendous amount of sense more than aliens creating the face.

Although quite a few people vehemetley express their opinions that the face is evidence of life on Mars, NASA says that they are not hiding any information about alien life. Why would NASA keep life on Mars a secret? If life was found on Mars, NASA would share the information because they would make a lot of money from it. They would make history if they had proof of life in Mars! Some defenders of NASA even wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. There is absolutely no way that NASA would turn down that amazing oppurtunity and keep the evidence to themselves.

The picture taken by Michael Malin is another reason to believe that the face was not an alien creation. He took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos by using his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC). The picture taken on April 5, 1998, revealed that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. There was no reason to believe that the face was not natural, but some people still believed that aliensdid in fact make the formation. The tenacious scientists were still determined to find evidence to make everyone see the truth.

April 8, 2001, was a cloudless day in Cydonia, and Mars Global Surveyor was able to get close enough to the face to capture a extraordinary photo.

The picture was taken using the camera's maximum resolution. If there were objects in the picture near the face, you could have seen what the objects were. There was nothing unusual aroung the Face on Mars.

The picture shows a Martion equivalent to landforms common around the American West. It reminds some people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is the same height as the Face on Mars. This evidence supports the idea that the giant, face-shaped formation is a natural landform, nothing more, nothing less. Aliens are not even proved to exist, let alone form a landform like this one.",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping it in place for the election of the President of the United States. While many have called for its abolition in favor of a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College has several important benefits that need to be taken into consideration.

The Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President through a popular vote of qualified citizens. This compromise preserved a balance between the power of the states and the power of the people. It consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to its Congressional delegation, ensuring that every state has a say in the presidential election.

One argument in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. In most states, the winner-take-all system awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. This system creates a decisive result, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote. Moreover, the winner of the electoral vote typically aligns with the winner of the popular vote. While there have been exceptions, such as the 2000 election, these occurrences are rare.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal. No single region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This requirement forces candidates to campaign across diverse regions and address the concerns of a wide range of voters. It prevents candidates with only regional appeal from winning the presidency, ensuring that the President represents the interests of the entire nation.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Because the winner-take-all method is used in most states, candidates focus on the states where the outcome is more uncertain. This means that voters in these swing states receive more attention and have a greater influence over the election. It leads to a more engaged electorate and encourages thoughtful voting.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores political balance between different states. Large states, by virtue of their population, would have an outsized influence in a purely popular vote system. The Electoral College balances this out by providing smaller states with a greater voice. This prevents candidates from ignoring smaller states and ensures that they pay attention to the concerns of all Americans.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College allows for a decisive winner. This avoids the complications and uncertainty of run-off elections and provides a clear outcome.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College serves a vital purpose in our democratic system. It provides a balance between the power of the states and the power of the people, and it ensures that the President represents the interests of the entire nation. While some argue for its abolition, the benefits of the Electoral College should not be overlooked. I urge you to consider these factors when discussing any potential changes to the election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"In my opinion, I think computer games have double influences. On the one hand, it is a good way for children to learn how to read and write, and on the other hand it provides them with a lot of fun and entertainment. I believe that children should have the right to choose what they want to do with their time and that they should not be forced to play certain games.

In your opinion what is the most effective way to reduce the number of children who play video games?",1
"Adolescent Mental Health in the Digital Age. The digital age has drastically changed the way many people interact with each other, and this shift has had a profound impact on adolescent mental health. As technology continues to evolve, it is becoming increasingly important for young adults to be educated about how to use these tools responsibly and safely as they navigate their growing independence. As adolescents become more absorbed in using computers and mobile devices for communication, entertainment, or self-expression, there are both positive and negative consequences associated with this increased access to media. While digital platforms can provide opportunities for social connection between peers that would otherwise remain isolated due to geographic distance or lack of face-to-face interaction, the potential risks associated with heavy technology usage must also be taken into account when discussing adolescent mental health. The constant availability of online networks means adolescents may devote too much time scrolling through content which can lead them down a path of procrastination from real world activities like school work or physical exercise; conversely excessive amounts of gaming or video streaming have been linked to higher rates of depression among those who struggle finding balance within their lives. Furthermore though anonymity may feel comforting at times it also leaves youth vulnerable since anyone can post whatever they want without consequence; bullying behavior often occurs under such circumstances leading some teens towards developing low self esteem issues over time if such behavior goes unchecked by family members or friends alike. Additionally one’s personal data shared across various sites could potentially open up avenues for predatory individuals seeking information about children so parents should ensure they monitor what type of websites children visit regularly while providing guidance around topics related internet security matters like managing passwords properly etcetera. In particular recent studies looking into the effects of social network usage has found that certain populations feel pressure from peers when posting updates on sites like Facebook which further exacerbates stress levels already present in adolescence years due its unique developmental demands upon maturity building processes such as identity formation etcetera . On top all these key factors increased",1
"Dear Senator, The electoral college was a perfect way of electing, in the 1900's. Now, we should be allowing the people of the United States decide who they want to be their president. Not only is this inequality, but it is deceiving and unfair. I know people say Life's unfair. and while it is, we should be doing our best to keep our country in line. We are already in a steep pile of debt. Obama has only made this worse. Why was he elected? Mostly because he is part of a minority. Inequality much?

U.S. citizens are being put to shame by every elector in the electoral college. We have the right to vote, for electors. And these electors barely ever follow suit. Not only do they stray from what the people want, they also take away our authority in the government. If we have the right to vote, then let us vote on wether or not to keep the electoral college. I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one who has these thoughts. I understand that I am simply a child and that you have no reason to listen to me, but if not me, listen to the rest of our country.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

passage 2, paragraph 10 As stated by Bradford Plumer, we do not elect our president. If we did, Al Gore would have been our president in 2000. If all men are equal, then why are you choosing certain people over the U.S. population. It is utterly deceiving to take our votes and throw them away, to make us think that our votes matter when they really don't. If this is who you want to choose our president, then don't have us vote.

Although people say that the electoral college takes away the chance of majority, that's how the system works. How do you think the president wins? They like to call it winnertakesall. That is a nice way to put it. The president is decided by the majority of votes in the electoral college. What puts these electors above me? I am young, but I have a working mind just like my parents. Why do my parents votes get pushed to the side and ignored? The reason is because the U.S. is a lying and unfair country. They tell us that we are the ones who control the government, yet they put our own people above us.

America has been going downhill and that is all that will continue if we dont change something. Getting rid of the electoral college will allow us to prosper. Why listen to a young teenager? Well, I know how it feels to be put on the bottom of the ladder, even if you are the smartest. America knows what is best for us. Not a few people chosen in each state to represent what they themselves want. Let us choose the president once, and if it doesn't work out, then you can continue your way. Just remember, if you never shoot for the moon, you will never reach the stars.",0

"Introduction:

The Face on Mars has been a topic of discussion for many years. Some people believe that it was created by aliens, while others think that it is just a natural landform. As a scientist at NASA, I have studied the available evidence and have come to the conclusion that the Face is indeed a natural landform. In this essay, I will present my argument and provide evidence from the article Unmasking the Face on Mars to support my claims.

Body:

First and foremost, it is important to understand that the Face on Mars is not a unique phenomenon. In fact, there are many similar landforms on Earth that have been created by natural processes such as erosion and weathering. For example, the Badlands in South Dakota and the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness in New Mexico both have features that resemble faces. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the Face on Mars was also created by natural processes.

Furthermore, the article Unmasking the Face on Mars explains that the Face is actually just one part of a larger formation known as the Cydonia Mensae. This formation consists of several other landforms that are similar in appearance to the Face. It is highly unlikely that aliens would have created multiple similar structures on Mars.

Another piece of evidence that supports the idea that the Face is a natural landform is the fact that it has been observed from different angles and at different times of day. If the Face was a man-made structure, it would appear the same from all angles and at all times. However, the Face on Mars appears to change depending on the angle and lighting conditions, which is consistent with a natural landform.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, while the Face on Mars may appear to be a man-made structure at first glance, there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it is actually a natural landform. The fact that there are similar formations on Earth, the presence of multiple similar structures in the Cydonia Mensae, and the changing appearance of the Face depending on lighting and angle all support this conclusion. Therefore, it is safe to say that the Face on Mars is not evidence of alien life, but rather a fascinating example of the power of natural processes.",1
"The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can detect human emotions. It's like a computer program that can read your face and know how you're feeling. Some people think it's a good idea to use this technology in classrooms to see how students are feeling. But I don't think it's a good idea.

First of all, it's an invasion of privacy. Students should be able to express their emotions without being monitored by a computer. It's like having a camera in the classroom that's always watching you. It would make me feel really uncomfortable.

Secondly, it's not always accurate. The article says that the technology can mistake one emotion for another. So, if a student is actually feeling sad, the computer might say they're angry. That could cause problems. Imagine if a teacher thought a student was angry when they were really just sad. It could lead to misunderstandings and unfair treatment.

Another thing is that it could be used to manipulate students. If a teacher knows how a student is feeling, they could use that information to try to control their behavior. That's not right. Students should be treated with respect and not used as experiments for new technology.

Finally, it's not necessary. Teachers can already tell how students are feeling by looking at their faces and body language. They don't need a computer program to do it for them. It's a waste of money and time.

In conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is not a good idea. It's an invasion of privacy, it's not always accurate, it could be used to manipulate students, and it's not necessary. Students should be able to express their emotions without being monitored by a computer.",1
"I say we all choose are own characteristic traits because everyone has a option. For example: The British naturalist John Lubbock was sophisticated person as one his characteristics traits therefore he had the right to write and read when other didnt have the choice. When John Lubbock choose to become an politician , but also a naturalist which he chose to become one. When John Lubbock wrote this prompt he took action to write it instead of be influence by others and becoming the same as them. Because if all politician were the same and influence by each other every time they would all be the same and wouldnt have made their mark. Back then I havent known a lot of British politicians that were naturalist as John Lubbock but, until now because he made his mark. People should have to make their own choices anyways because you cant work as a politician and always agree with what people say and be influence by it you have to make your own choices. In between that John Lubbock shows he's made his own choices about this and you as the reader to think about it also and makes a choice. When it come to talking about what characteristic traits we have its based on the person who decided to become whoever they want to become and control their out come in life. In conclusion the way were based on the way we act or show who we are, for are traits",0
"The increased amount of school hours could have both positive and negative effects on Afghan students' attendance, grades, and educational life. On one hand, having additional time spent in school would give students more time to understand the material and complete their work, leading to improved grades. Furthermore, longer hours may discourage them from skipping school, leading to higher attendance records. On the other hand, lack of proper resources such as textbooks, additional staff, and educational materials may lead to lower quality of education and limit students' ability to truly benefit from the additional school hours. Additionally, this can also cause students to become overwhelmed and tired from longer days, leading to low morale and reduced motivation, resulting in decreased attendance and poorer grades. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that adequate resources and support are available to Afghan students before extending their school day.",1
"In some schools they have a program that pairs older student with younger student. The older student are available to assist the younger student in order to succeed on their goal. Aww man, I **** hate this, I don't know how to make this spaghetti and meatball sandwich I had the wheat bread, the sauce, manssreala cheese, spaghetti and my meatballs what else in this world am I missing. Did you know that 50% of the population of older student have often fail because of lack of communication and the other half is lack of knowledge. I believed, If older student help the younger kids they will they both will succeed in different things. For example, communicating more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on.

Learning to communicate more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. I learn my mistake because one of the older student name Generic_Name, help me with a problem involving math and science. Generic_Name love math and would love to help me, their were a lot of steps I need to do it was only five minutes when he was done, but it felt like an eternal. I understand why I was wrong and what I need to do in order to get it right. From my point of view I knew he was having trouble communicating with me because he was studding a lot and made mistakes. We both learn a lesson that nobody is perfect the first time. I love the quote that Leon Missie said at the convention. He said Nobody Is Perfect The First Time, and remember that everyone has a talent or skill. That means everyone has made a mistake more than once and try to fix it. I remember the time I did a terrible mistake, I was in a chemistry class In Generic_School I was doing in a experiment, I had to put on my safety first. I over did with the salt a little bit. In a dangerous chemical called La Muete, which means that it is poisonous, so the becker exploded in to a million pieces and all I saw was fire on my cloth and on the teacher desk .The teacher quickly got the fire extinguisher and put it on me first and then the fire form letting spread more and boy I got my **** kick by my mom and dad so hard that they made me pay for all the damage I created. So my teacher got me an assist too help me with the calculation so I don't mess up again. Eventually, I pass the class with a B-, I was relief that it was over and I won't do that chemical bond ever again.

Often successes can help both young and older student. Sometimes the older student can make a mistake too and teach the younger student. That it is okay if you made a mistake, but make sure that you don't know something don't leave it blank just try and figure out what missing because the assist won't be there all ways. Life dosen't work like that, their are thing that we have to figure out on our own. My job is teach you what the problem that your stuck on and me learning how to communicate with others and you learning your problems, and trying to fix them.I remember when I got my license at the age 21 and yes that means I crash a lot, turning in the wrong direction, and even broken into people yards. Yes, it really hard driving and I had this final attempt that if I don't pass then I don't ever get my license even when I really old. So I study hard and where i'm I supposed to go, stop when the light is red, Break when something is moving in the road, read the speed limit, park in a specific position ,and most importantly turn on the signal. I had an assist or should I say my friend Generic_Name, was with me and telling me what to do. I thought I was going to crash in to someones yard again but not this time, I was driving pretty go actually .So the day had come and I need to relaxed and not think about failing, and them my family will laugh at me for not passing, and I had to live with my parents all the time just because I can't drive. I stared to do go and the instructor showing me where to turn. After a few hours had passed I barely had passed with a C- and that not to go and not to bad. I had my license and my life was going go too.

To sum it all up, all over the world school have a program called Two is better than One it a program that allows older student assist the younger student in order for them to succeed in the conflicts there having trouble on It helps both old and younger students. It helps the older student to communicate more with people and so on and so forth. When the older student learn how to communicate with others they with eventually learn to help or talk to strangers more often. Failure can eventually lead to successes, like my driving license, I fail lots of times but that never stop me from getting my driving license. From that chemistry class that I almost took the whole school down with me. From that final attempt I learn that no matter how many time you fall there will always be a way to succeed. But there will be time were you need someone assist so they can help you. Did you have a difficult time on something and ask someone to help you or fail at a test and the teacher have you an assist in order for you to pass it again?",0
"Having a positive attitude is essential for success in life. It affects how we perceive and interpret the world around us, and can significantly influence the paths we choose to take.

"In the modern era, cell phone use in school has become commonplace. While it is undeniable that cell phones have become integral tools in our daily lives, their presence in educational settings has raised some concerning questions. Should cell phones be allowed in the classroom? 

Some argue that cell phones can be a useful learning tool, allowing students to quickly access online resources and stay connected with their peers. Unfortunately, this logic overlooks the far more pressing issue of cell phone use as a distraction. Whether we realize it or not, cell phones are a dangerous gateway into an endless array of social media, gaming, and entertainment options. Even if a student has resisted the urge to waste their time, their peers may not have. Whether it’s checking one’s notifications or carelessly playing games, having cell phones in a classroom environment encourages a culture of disruption and inattentiveness. 

In addition to being a distraction, cell phones can also be a security hazard. With the sheer amount of sensitive data stored on phones, bringing them into a school environment exposes students and staff to an increased risk of cyberbullying, cheating, and identity theft. In the faintest possible scenario, the presence of cellular devices can also encourage physical theft and other vulnerabilities. 

For these reasons, there is a distinct need to protect student safety by limiting or altogether banning the use of cell phones in school. Barring special circumstances, a school should maintain the environment it has been tasked to maintain: a space for students to learn without outside distraction or risk. Only then can students fully maximize their education and achieve the success they have been striving for.",1
"Education is a continuous process that goes beyond the boundaries of a classroom. Some people believe that learning should never stop, while others argue that formal education is enough. In my opinion, education is a lifelong process, and it is essential for personal growth, career development, and societal progress.

Firstly, education is essential for personal growth. Learning new things can help individuals develop new skills, broaden their horizons, and become more knowledgeable. For example, a person who learns a new language can communicate with people from different cultures and understand their perspectives. Similarly, learning a new skill, such as cooking or painting, can add value to an individual's personal life and provide a sense of accomplishment.

Secondly, education is crucial for career development. In today's fast-paced world, individuals need to continuously upgrade their skills to stay relevant in their respective fields. For example, a software engineer needs to learn new programming languages to keep up with the latest technological advancements. Similarly, a doctor needs to stay updated with the latest medical research and techniques to provide the best possible care to their patients.

Lastly, education is essential for societal progress. A well-educated society is more likely to be prosperous and peaceful. Education can help individuals develop critical thinking skills, become more tolerant, and appreciate diversity. Moreover, education can play a crucial role in addressing social issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.

In conclusion, education is a lifelong process that is essential for personal growth, career development, and societal progress. Learning new things can help individuals become more knowledgeable, develop new skills, and broaden their horizons. Moreover, education can play a crucial role in addressing social issues and creating a better world for future generations. Therefore, I strongly believe that education should be a continuous process, and individuals should never stop learning.",1
"When I was in middle school, I started to research career options, and the best way to do that was to talk to my teachers. I also went on college and company visits to get a better understanding of what I might want to do in the future. I looked into what classes I could take in high school to give me an advantage in the career I would choose. Then I focused on what college requirements would need to be met for my desired field of work. I also started to see the benefit of having ambition and working hard from a young age to put me on the fast-track for success in the profession I chose.",1

"Texting while driving is a profoundly serious topic and it often comes up. Texting and driving are talked about all the time, but people don't take it in consideration to be serious about the situation. Some drivers say I can do text while driving or it'll only take a second. Thinking / saying that is a foolish thing because all of us feel that we can multitasking. We take these situations lightly until something really happens and then we wish we could take it all back.

Texting and driving can be a serious hazard; for example, a Georgia teen, Cristina PavonBaker, got 15 years for killing her best friend. She was driving 105 mph, racing another student then she started to use snapchat and crashed into a tree. For that reason, I feel that it should be banned in all 50 states because this is a serious cause, and everyone is taking it lightly. People who use cell phones distraction rates are high. In this generation we use our cell phones a lot so when it's hard for us to concentrate and to focus on things that are more important.

When you are texting and driving it's like driving down a soccer field or football field blindfolded. According to my research, texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eye off the road for 2.5 seconds, which is how long it takes to switch lanes. It is dangerous and deadly to not only yourself but also to other drivers and passengers. Texting and driving have beat drinking and driving as the most leading cause of deaths among teens. Us teen are not the only ones, 49 percent of adult drivers admitted that they text and drive.

Teens die every day for making the wrong decisions and not caring about the outcome. We don't care about the law until something happens and we wish that we could go back in time and change everything and not do what we did. The penalties of texting and driving can be jail or prison time or a misdemeanor. The fine could be as low as $20 and as up to $500 depending on the

To sum it up, we would be better if phones weren't allowed in the car at all. You can be killed or can kill someone if you are distracted driving. We are always distracted by our phones so when we are driving, we are tempted to get on it and do stuff. When we do, we have consequences to our actions and sometimes we must pay for what we do. We need to take responsibility and own up for our actions. We need to stop taking things like this lightly. I hope I encouraged you to not do this and put the cell phones down.",0
"Over the course of time, NASA has developed the technology that is capable of taking pictures of landforms found on other planets. Recently, NASA unveiled an image of a landform on Mars that looks like a human face. Some people believe that it a real face of an alien and make conspiracy theories about the face and spread it throughout the public. Even though that the face on Mars is just a rock landform shaped like a human face.

Firstly, humans would not be able to survive on Mars. The gases and lack of oxygen would kill them. The reality is that the picture is an actual human or alien face is just made up by conspiracy theorists . NASA has revealed this to the public so that they could some attention to mars.The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars (3).They just wanted conspiracy theorist to make people think that there was some sort of ancient civilization on Mars or some kind of aliens. Which was proven not to exist.

After NASA getting all attention on Mars from the Face on Mars debate, they went back upto space to see if they could capture more photos. NASA was using high-tech cameras to prove their theory of seeing a human face. MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when then image first appeared on JPL website, revealing... a natrual landform(7). The face is just a landform not an alien monument nor a human face.

Later on, after taking the pictures of the proven landform on Mars, the topic started to quite down. Some conspiracy theorist still spread their theories to the public. This is all how NASA researches foreign landforms on other planets. They take their camera satillites and capture a picture of the landform and continue to study it. NASA uses the knowledge they have about Earth to study the landforms on other planets. It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, say Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes place from an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12). The process just starts all over again.

After looking at all the scientific knowlege, you can conclude that the Face on Mars is just a landform. NASA does this so that they can get public attention about their research, until the theory is proven wrong. It is just like any other buisness that wants publicity. Aliens are currently proven to not exist, so most people like to try to change that theory whenever they find a small peice,of what could be eveidence. Even though it is proven to be a landmass.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can tackle issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improve public health, and create more sustainable and accessible communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in car-intensive areas, we can significantly decrease these emissions. For instance, the German suburb of Vauban has successfully implemented a car-free community where 70% of families do not own cars. This has resulted in cleaner air and less pollution for residents. Similarly, during a partial driving ban in Paris to combat smog, congestion decreased by 60% and pollution levels dropped. These examples show that limiting car usage can have a direct positive impact on the environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of public health. The passage set highlights that car emissions contribute to poor air quality, leading to smog and respiratory issues. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and decrease health problems associated with pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was introduced to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participated by hiking, biking, or taking public transportation to work. This event showcased the potential for car-free initiatives to improve public health by reducing pollution levels and creating clean and breathable environments.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. The passage set mentions the concept of smart planning and creating compact suburbs that are designed to be less dependent on cars. This includes placing stores within walking distance, improving public transportation options, and reducing the amount of parking space. By implementing these changes, communities can become more walkable, reduce the need for car usage, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. Vauban, Germany, is an example of a community that has adopted these principles and created a car-free environment. This has resulted in residents feeling happier and less stressed, as mentioned by a media trainer and mother of two in the passage.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit society as a whole. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote public health. Additionally, creating communities that are less dependent on cars can lead to increased sustainability and accessibility. It is important for societies to embrace initiatives that encourage alternative forms of transportation and limit car usage in order to create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"TEXTING AND DRIVING ESSAY

Today, a lot of car accidents are caused by distracted driving. Texting while driving caused a lot of deaths and injuries Over the last few years. People confused themselves when it comes to texting and driving and they don't realize it's a mistake until it's too late. In my opinion I think its best if people turn their phones of completely before they leave their location. Texting and driving is against the law so young drivers and older adults should take it serious.

It doesn't matter who's texting you that notification can wait. Taking your eyes off the road while driving should never be acceptable. Me personally, I don't think it's the smartest decision to pick up my phone while driving for any reason. Another reason why it's not safe to text and drive is because it's against the law. Breaking the law against texting and driving results in you having to pay money out your pockets. So just try your best to avoid the situation.

Statistics are rising fast for car accidents caused by texting and driving. We all know the love ones at home wouldn't want us to be a part of that statistic. We can change our ways and lower the statistic by simply obeying the law and being patient enough to wait to check our phones. If you don't care enough to avoid a simple mistake, then so be it. My purpose for writing this essay is so people understand how risky texting and driving is so let's make it easy for one another and not be a part of that group of people who partake in texting and driving.",0
"In today's world, the importance of a college education cannot be overstated. For many, obtaining an undergraduate or graduate degree is not only important for finding success in life but also in helping to open up new career opportunities and make a lasting impact on society. With that said, there are certain considerations one should take into account when pursuing their college education: the cost of tuition, potential debt accumulation and what type of degree best suits their goals. When it comes to considering the cost of attending college, it is essential to remember that higher education can be expensive. Tuition fees vary widely from institution to institution as do associated costs such as room and board fees or additional fees related to activities like student clubs or sports teams. It is therefore important for prospective students to research different universities and colleges so they can find an option that fits within their budget without compromising academic ambitions. Additionally, grants and scholarships may be available which could help alleviate some of the financial burden associated with attaining a university degree. Similarly debt accumulation during school years should also be taken into consideration by those looking at furthering their education; more often than not loans will need to be taken out in order for individuals have access funds needed for tuition payments or other educational expenses . However it should always kept mind that repayment plans will eventually need met after graduation , students should try minimize amount loaned if possible , aiming pay off any existing debts incurred while school quickly once they start working full-time jobs . Finally , when deciding what kind degree opt pursue , individuals must consider both short long-term objectives aims achieve through respective field study . Different types degrees exist across variety subjects fields ranging sciences humanities business engineering etcetera - each represent unique set skills competencies applicable specific areas work industries .

"In the passage, The Challenge of Exploring Venus', the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit for scientists. The author includes many advantages and disadvantages in the passage. The author is very good at explaing why and how we can acheive this goal. He also explains his stance very clearly, offering advice and explaining both sides. Venus is very much alike to Earth, yet scientists have yet to truly understand the planet. While there are some challenges that his idea presents, there are more benefits and advantages. Exploring and continuing to study Venus would benefit us greatly, both in the present, and in the future.

The author says that studying Venus would be beneficial for many reasons. One being that Venus is very much alike to Earth. The author states that Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. He says that both planets share many important qualities that we as humans, need for survival. He states that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of like, just like Earth and Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. This information shows that Venus and Earth are similar and with more knowledge about the planet, they could possibly visit Venus in the future.

Another reason why Venus should be further explored is to further our knowledge and our basis of understanding. The author says in the passage that Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.. He also says that Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. This is very true. Struggles and obstacles in our way or obtaining knowledge should not prevent us from continuing forever, but should motivate us to find another way to acheive our goal. Although there may be obstacles that seem impossible to overcome, scientists can and will overcome them. Continuing to study Venus will acheive just this concept.

How we are going to visit Venus without getting injured by the elements is simple. Although Venus has many obstacles that will make it hard for us to come in contact and learn more, NASA has a great solution. The author says that by creating a type of vehicle that could hover just over the Venusian landscapes, scientists would be able to study Venus safely. Being at a certain height above the planet would prevent unsurvivable conditions and make it bearable for humans to be there. The author does say however, that because they are so high, their vision would be limited. This idea is favorable and definetly acheivable in the near future.

In conclusion, studying Venus is a very worthy pursuit. The author gives many benefits for the continuation of studying Venus and he also gives reasoning as to why and how we can do it. He supports his idea very well with immense amoun of evidence to back up his claim. The universe is hugely immeasurable and Venus is the next door neighbor to Earth. While scientists have access to improving technology and while they have the resources to do so, they should take action towards studying Venus.",0
"Dear State Senator, This letter of argument is to emphasize why we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. There are very reasonable arguments for both claims as to if we should keep or abolish the Electoral College. Primarily, the Electoral College is the selection of electorss by popular vote to represent their supported party in the official presidential election. There is a total of 538 Electoral College electorss and it only takes the majority, 270 votes, to elect the president. It is not fair that the general population does not get an independent vote.

It is not the ordinary people who get to choose the president they want it is dependent upon which party the electors chooses. Voters don't have control over who their electorss vote for. As said in the second article, Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000 against Bush however, Gore lost the electorsal vote resulting in the loss of the presidential election. In the past, there have been voters who refused to vote for their party's candidate and voted for whomever. There is also the concern of a tie in the electorsal vote.

If that were to happen then there would certainly be no chance that the popular vote would have an impact on the selection of the president because it would now be in the hands of the House of Representatives. The Electoral College is unfair to voters they do not get the final choice as to where their vote goes. They are not voting for the presidential candidate they want. The voters are voting for a slate of electorss. However, there are some benefits to having an Electoral College such as larger states getting more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states and it also avoids RunOff elections which is when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes.

State Senator, please realize that this is not fair or justifiable. There may be an upside to the Electoral College, however, it is in my strongest opinion based on factual content that this is not a fair method and it should be abolished. Being empathetic for the ordinary voters of the United States would provide clarity for your opinion on the situation. Imagine if you were a general voter who did not get an official vote in the presidential election you would feel cheated also. This is why I ask you to strongly consider these legitimate words.",0
"Many people think that the face are created by aliens. Myself thinking i dont think aliens are real. This face from Mars in 1976 is natural form from Earth. We're still researching on the real idea of what is may have came from in the pass years. Also, many says it may be a reflected or shadow from something. Other scientist conclude that it may be just rocks in a hug formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows or dust giving illusion of eyes, nose ,and mouth. They called it The Face on Mars. Most of the commuication of it started in a Hollywood film. Appeared in books ,magazines, radio talk shows , even hauted grocery store checkoutlines for 25 years. I think theres just a rock with holes in the it , looking like a human face but no one will never know til someone takes the trip to find out. By many think it was aliens creating it, people just assummed that idea. Other scientist still today wonder what it really is or how was it really created. There may have been a ancient civilization on Mars years ago. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for research to post a better and good viewer of the Face on Mars. Im thinking , by revealing alot of research, taking pictures and not approving that the face isnt changed by the amount of days and years, that it may just be a natural landform and that theres no aliens monument after all. There will still be other thinking and having their own opinions about the Face on Mars. Everyone wont just be satisfied with one fact or option about the face. Still many and most scientist are till snapping camera shots of the face and posting them on the web. More and more people and scientist will have diiferent thoughts about it and the world will never know what is going and what is it really until someone actually observed face to face. In my opinion, I think by wasting time doing research on something so little that have been lasting for years, no one never had the time to really go observe the reality about the face. Doing this research and conclude things will never tell the people answers about what the face.",0
"When I think of success, I often go back to the words of Winston Churchill who said, Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. From my personal life experiences, I believe this statement to be incredibly true. When I have faced difficulties in the past, I was able to push through these hard times with enthusiasm and optimism. Without this attitude of enthusiasm, I would have given up much sooner. This statement taught me the importance of remaining passionate and determined no matter what challenges were thrown my way. 

I think the statement is an important one for others to remember, no matter the endeavor they are involved in. Difficult times are inevitable, and this statement can inspire people to grit their teeth, stay enthusiastic, and eventually reach their goal despite any failures. It can help people learn from their mistakes and find new solutions in order to continue towards success.

"The media is a powerful tool that can make or break a person's reputation. In the case of celebrities, the media can often be intrusive, and many people believe that celebrities should be given more privacy. However, there are also those who believe that the price of fame is loss of privacy.

There is no doubt that celebrities are often treated unfairly by the media. The media often invades their privacy, and they are often the subject of gossip and speculation. This can be very harmful to their reputation, and it can make it difficult for them to lead normal lives.

However, there are also some benefits to being a celebrity. For example, celebrities often have a lot of influence, and they can use this influence to raise awareness about important issues. They also often have access to resources that ordinary people do not have, and they can use these resources to help others.

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to being a celebrity. However, it is up to each individual to decide whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.",1
"In recent years, taking classes from home has become increasingly popular. Proponents of this option argue that it allows for greater convenience and freedom, allowing students to adjust their learning to their own schedule. Additionally, online classes can be lower in cost than traditional classes, and allow students to access materials from anywhere in the world. 

However, there are also some considerable downsides to studying from home. Depending on the class, it can be difficult to receive personalized instruction, and students may find it hard to stay motivated without the accountability that comes from being in a traditional classroom environment. Additionally, there can be technological issues when taking classes online, such as internet disruptions or problems with programs or materials. 

Overall, the decision to take classes online versus in-person comes down to individual preference and goals. Those who value convenience or want to take on their study commitments at their own pace may find that online classes are a great fit for them, while those who want more direct instruction may want to stick with in-person classes. Whichever students choose, it is important to weigh both the pros and cons before making a decision.",1
"The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider its benefits when contemplating any potential changes to the current system of electing the President of the United States.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote by qualified citizens. Its process involves the selection of electors, the voting by electors for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President (What Is the Electoral College?).

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and undemocratic, there are several practical reasons why it should be retained. Firstly, the certainty of outcome is higher with the Electoral College. Although disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. Due to the winner-take-all system in each state, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote (Posner, 18).

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President has a trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning candidates must appeal to a diverse range of states and regions. This results in a President who represents the interests and concerns of the entire nation, rather than just a specific region (Posner, 19).

Moreover, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This allows voters in these states to have a more direct impact on the election and encourages candidates to address the specific concerns of these states (Posner, 20).

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large states against small states. Although the popular vote may be close in a large state, the winner receives a significant number of electoral votes, ensuring their attention and consideration for the concerns of that state. This prevents smaller states from being overlooked in the electoral process (Posner, 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This reduces the complexity and cost of the election process while still producing a clear and decisive winner (Posner, 22).

It is important to note that voter turnout is not significantly affected by the Electoral College. Despite the fact that individual votes may not swing a national election, approximately half of the eligible American population still participates in presidential elections (Posner, 23). Voters are driven by their desire to express their political preference rather than solely relying on the belief that their vote will decide the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a practical and effective method for electing the President. Its retention ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, balances the weight of large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made to any system, it is crucial to consider the experience and wisdom of our founding fathers when evaluating any potential changes to the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of retaining the Electoral College for the future of our democratic nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Some people said that haveing a positive actitude is the key to success in life? How do we know this and, how can we demostrate this on real life, well here I have three examples of how to be a positive person it help me to be success in life.

In my first year as a freshman i was a lonely and boring person I didn't talk to any body, i was dumb I remember that i used to had a really good teacher her name was Generic_Name, i remember that i was bad with her and know i just want to aplogize with her, my point in here is that if my attitude was positive in that time thingscould be different in many ways and thats why i decide to chenge my attitude.

In my second year I decide to talk with more people and be positive person and because of that I star to have new friends and more teachers like me and when a teacher likes you they help you more and thats a small way to show that have a positive actitude is the key in life, and because i'm not a smart student, that extra help that the teachers give me, it help me to pass my classes.

In my third year, well it was pretty fun because when I change into a positive attitude i got new frinds and when i was in problems they help me, like i losse my pencil they borrow me one, or when i miss my bus they give me a ride to my home or they give me a number of a bus that is close to my house, when i was apsent they ask for my missing work so they can give it to me.

In conclution the positive attitude is the key in life because it makes you friendly and more people like you because of that.",0
"In May, 1976, Mars became the center for many conspiracy theories and research for alien life. A picture of what seems to be a huge head in a rock formation was unveiled, and immediately started to sway people's minds that there might be alien life on Mars. Some took this belief way too far. However many conspiracy theories are claiming that the martian mesa in Cydonia is a sign of alien life, none of them are correct. In all truth, it is just another naural land formation on the desolate planet.

When a picture of the mesa was first unveiled to the public, it made so many people believe it was a sign of life on Mars. NASA claimed that is was just a normal rock formation, and was confirmed in 2001 when they took another picture with newer technology, revealing a big mesa with a few craters. People still don't believe NASA that it is just a crater. If the mesa was a sign of alien life, NASA would benefit greatly from it. So when people say that it's a sign of life and NASA knows about it, that's so incredibly wrong because if it was, NASA would be there right now with a rover, exploring the strange sign. NASA has done extensive research on this, and have found no life, while people are claiming huge things like this without doing any research, so it is very hard for anyone to believe them.

The next photo, taken in 1998, of the mesa reveals nothing but a natural landform. When the picture was taken, there were some wispy clouds over the top of it, which made some people believe alien markings were hidden by haze. Even though there is a slight haze over the mesa, there is no way a slight haze could hide alien markings the way some people belive. Even with the haze, the picture is still much more clear than the original photo from 1976.

The newest, and most clear picture is from 2001. It was a cloudless day this time when the Mars Global Surveyor passed over the mesa and snapped a picture of it. The picure was taken using the highest resolution in the camera's capability. This type of quality photography allowed for us, back on Earth, to be able to see if there were even smaller objects on the mesa, like airplanes or small shacks The picture revealed, once again, that there is not really a face on the mesa on Mars. The conspiracy theorists are still coming up with ways to try and find a way to make NASA seem like liars. After 25 years, it still didn't work.

After 25 years, and 3 picture all concluding that the mesa has no sings of life, people are still talking about crazy ideas of life outside of Earth. While there is a possibility of life outside of Earth, there is definitely none currently on the mesa that has created so much controversy, for such a long period of time all around the world.",0
"There is no right answer to this question, as different people have different opinions. Some people think that children should learn to compete, as this will teach them how to be successful in life. Others think that children should be taught to cooperate, as this will help them to get along with others and work together effectively.

Personally, I think that both competition and cooperation are important. Competition can teach children how to set goals and work hard to achieve them. Cooperation can teach children how to communicate and work together with others. Both skills are important in life, and children should learn both.

Of course, there is a downside to competition. If children are always competing with each other, they may start to see others as opponents instead of friends. They may also become discouraged if they are not the best at everything. However, as long as children are taught to be good sports and to handle both winning and losing gracefully, competition can be a healthy and beneficial activity.

In conclusion, I believe that both competition and cooperation are important for children to learn. Competition can teach children how to set goals and work hard, while cooperation can teach children how to communicate and work together with others.",1
"Using a motor vehicle as a source of transportation is part of everyday life and is not rare to the stereotypical American. But cities such as Paris, Bogota, and Vauban are all striving towards reducing the rate of motor vehicle usage in their areas. Advantages of limiting car usage are lower greenhouse gas rates, suburbs can become more compact and more accessible to public transportation, and people are able to live less stressful lives.

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions and is responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but is slowly making a change towards helping the environment and being beneficial towards carbon emissions. In 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States was at it's highest rate. As time went by, the numbers started dropping and getting lower. Many sociologits believe that if the numbers get even lower and stay at that rate, the benefits will come for the environment but unfortunately not for car companys. Paris typically has more smog than any other European capital and is working towards a way to fix that. Paris banned driving due to the intensity and abundance of the smog in their city and had people use public transportation free of charge for about a week. Not using motor vehicles for those days really did help the situation of Paris and gave people an insight as to how life would be without cars.

Vauban, an upscale community in Germany, is home to suburban pioneers who have given up their cars. Seventy percent of vaughn's family do not own cars and fiftyseven percent sold a car to move there. Smart planning is a component of the movement to separate suburban life from auto use to create a denser and more compact environment and let people be more accesssible to public transportation. This means less space for parking, and more stores compactly placed and at short distances. In Bogota, Carfree day is part of an improvement campaign which helps residents of the city to see how life is life without the use of cars for a day. People use public transportation and walk to their destinations with no problem. More parks and sport centers have also been added to the area as a result of less car usage, so more space for other important things.

Dropping off your kid at daycare, then driving to work, then having to drive your child to soccer practice can be a constant and stressful cycle for most parents. Residents of suburbs that have low car usage rates claim that they are less stressful. In a suburban community with little to no motor vehicle usage, the suburb will be more compact, having more stores and buildings closer to eachother at very short distances. This makes it easier for residents to get from point A to point B quicker and more efficiently. This also allows for more walking areas with less traffic and dangerous cars to worry about.

Cars can be useful in many ways but for the better of the enviorment, peoples cities, and sanity, little to no car use is the way to go.",0
"Dear Senator Don Gates,

There has been many arguments about whether or not to keep the electoral college or to change the election process by popular vote. The best way to go would be to use popular vote. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. (Plumer, paragraph 14). There are so many reasons as to why you should change to popular vote, When you vote for your candidate, you're actually voting for your candidates electors, sometimes the state legislatures pick the electors, and also its an unfair process to voters. The Electoral College needs to be booted out!

When you go to vote, you think that you are directly voting for your candidates, that is no the case. You are actually voting for your candidates electors. You cannot control who your electors vote for either. They do not always vote for the same person you wnat them to. Voters may sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. This has happened. If the process were done by popular vote then their wouldnt be these problems taking place.

Who picks the electors? Sometimes it is the State Legislautures. They are responsible. In the article

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong

, it states that in 1960, segregationists almos succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones that would then oppose John F. Kennedy. This was so a popular vote would not go to Kennedy. Also it was stated that faithless electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please. This doesnt seem fair to the people.

The whole process of the Electoral College is unfair to voters. There is a reason behind this accusation. The winner-take-all system to be more precise. Candidates dont spend time in states that they know they have not a slight chance of winning, they tend to focus more on the swing states. During a campaign in 2000, seventeen states didnt get to see candidates at all. Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. As it was stated in the article

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,

If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it....

The Electoral College is not the best way to decide who runs our military, or nation. We need a way to have a fair and equal vote. Popular vote is the way. Though the electoral college is a quick and easier way to get votes in, it isnt very efficient. The process isnt fair to the people at all, you're not directly voting for the candidate of your choice, and state legislatures, who have opinions, pick the elctors. Bob Dole was right: Abolish rhe electoral college!",0
"Voting has always been something special for almost everyone. From African Americans fighting in the Civil War for the right to vote and women in the nineteenthcentury also fighting for voting rights, Voting had always been a controversial topic. This privilege has changed many times in the beginning of the United States and since its birth, the primary way to vote for the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral college is a process of electors in it voting for the president. It is almost always an onesided battle for whoever that agrees or disagrees with the Electoral college. For someone that is usually neutral, i am in favor of keeping the Electoral College as the United States choose their president.

To begin with, even though the Electoral College is criticized of it not being democratic, it still allows the peoples voices to be heard and expressed. The trust between the people and their electors is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College will almost always guarantee an outcome while if it was another way, more ties and balancing will happen. from the article itself, it stated Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state. Richard A. Posner. The Electoral College will always let the people's voices be heard even if it was in a indirect way.

Furthermore, The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No single region in the United States ave enough electoral votes for a president to get elected. Regional favorites, such as rodney in the south, will have plenty of problems if he is just a regional favorite instead of all over the country. This system will caused presidents to be more diverse in the country to be able to spread hierarchical diffusion of the idea of geting themselves to be elected. From source number three, it also states that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Richard A. Posner. The people will get to experience the president themselves instead of jst voting for the one they are biased upon.

Lastly, The Electoral College method of selecting the president avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissolves the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. There is a pressure in which if no candidates win a majority of the vote,there will be a runoff election. that would greatly complicate the presidential election process by wasting more time and money. however, that process is reduced by the Electoral College method, which invariably produces a clear winner. The Electoral College System can also be argued against that it can turn off potential voters for a candidate who had no hope of carrying thier state. Knowing their vote will have no effect, there will be less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. Richard A. Posner is one of the quotes in source number three. But of course, no single vote can change the outcome of a presidential election since voters in presidential elections are mpstly people who want to express an opinion than thinking that a single vote will change a election.

In conclusion, our current way of the Electoral College system is the best way to vote for presidential elections. Even though people could argue that it is undemocratic, the way they elect the electors and having the president promote themselves in a certain way does make the system every one bit of it democratic. To remind you senator, the Electoral Collage system should stay because it still allows the peoples voices to be heard and expressed, requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissolves the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. That is why i truly believe that the Electoral Collage is here to stay.",0
"Joining extracurricular activities can be an invaluable part of a child's educational journey, allowing students to explore their interests, make new friends, and grow emotionally and intellectually. However, allowing students to choose which activities they participate in also carries several risks. Without parental guidance, students run the risk of making choices that might not be in their best academic or social interests. Additionally, leaving the decision up to the students can lead to inconsistency in terms of the messages they are receiving from adults and peers. This could lead to the student feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about which activities are right for them. Ultimately, whether or not to leave the decision of joining extracurricular activities up to students depends on the age and maturity of the student, as well as the quality of the guidance from parents and teachers.",1
"The electoral college has many reasons it should stay , but more reasons why it should be gone. The electoral college is giving people false hope in the election, yet many people think there choosing the president , or they have voice when really the choose the electors who choose the president. The election should be chosen by popular vote adderall it is the peoples say who runs there country.

In the electoral college who really has a voice apparently not the people. In the article What is the Electoral College  author The Office Of The Federal register it proclaims  You help choose your state electors when you vote for president because when you chose your candidate you actually vote for your candidates electors. It is evident that many people really not dont know who there voting for in the democratic government. We have discovered the decision isn't in the people hands , but did we think about how the electors could always defy the will of the people in the article The Indefensible Electoral College author Bradford Plumer says , and he makes a valid point no matter if your candidate wins by a landslide the electors still choose who becomes president.

Another reason why the electoral college should be changed into popular vote is because each has a different amount of electors. If you thought not being able to actually your president was wrong, but what about your state having fewer or more electoral votes ,and thats the deciding factor on if your candidate wins. Author of the  The indefensible Electoral College Pulmer states at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voter, because of the winnertake all system in each state,candidates dont spend time in states they know they hace no chance in winning. The electoral college should be done away with immediately not only is the democratic system is not so democratic , but its not letting the peoples voice be heard.

furthermore it is evident that the election should be based on popular votes. And if its based on popular votes the people voices will be heard , and they will actually have a say in which candidate wins. And isn't that why America is so special because it lets peoples voices be heard. Dont take that distinctive factor away because it makes Of America what it is today  .",0
"My claim towards this topic on whether or not to use this computer technology in a classroom would be effective or not. In my opinion yes, im all for this technology in a classroom. Mainly because i know as a student i do get bored and i do get tired when im reading an article and if this technology can read our facial recognition and change the lesson based on how us as students are feeling on the scale of facial recongnition. This article states that the computers in schools now wouldnt be able to handle this sort of technology, so what my main question is. How much would it cost schools to get a hold of this kind of technology and especially this amount of technology. When schools globaly are already asking the government for more money as a whole alot of schools have already asked for over 5 referendums in less than 4 years, in that case how could schools afford 3,000 computers with this technology inside it.

If we were to switch to this facial recognition software why couldnt us students jut all be homecshooled by a computer beause as Dr. Huang states  Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor so why would we need a(n) human intructor if this technology can act as a human instructor and change lesson plans according to how we are feeling based on facial expressions. In conclusion all i would like to say is that yes this technology could be very effective in schools in the future if schools had the mony to buy all this technololgy. An even bigger point I would like to make is why have school, if this technology can act as a human instructor?",0
"School cafeterias have long been a source of contention and debate among students, parents, educators, and administrators. From the quality and variety of food to health concerns such as allergies and dietary restrictions, questions surrounding school cafeteria operations come up with every new school year. While some schools are able to provide healthy meals that meet both budget constraints and taste expectations, many find themselves struggling to strike a balance between these two priorities. A key factor in achieving success is recognizing the importance of having an adequately trained staff within the cafeteria. Food service workers should be knowledgeable on proper hygiene practices when handling food preparation equipment as well as how to store perishable items so they remain safe for consumption by students. Furthermore, it is imperative for staff members to understand federal regulations regarding nutrition standards for each meal served in order to ensure that appropriate amounts of vitamins and minerals are included in breakfast or lunch menus designed according to government guidelines. Having a certified dietician on staff can also help facilitate decision making concerning what foods make it onto the menu while still adhering to budgetary restraints imposed by local governing bodies or school districts. In addition to hiring informed personnel who can make smart decisions about food choices within set budgets there are other steps which should be taken in order maximize efficiency while maintaining nutritious options available at all times throughout the day; this includes scheduling sufficient time between meal periods so that ample time is allowed for cleanup followed by setup prior to next session starting if multiple servings occur throughout one day period . Moreover , consideration must be given towards minimizing waste through thoughtful preplanning allowing just enough ingredients purchased so that no uneaten edible material remains at end of serving period requiring disposal into trash receptacles; this economical approach helps create positive outcomes from standpoint reducing cost associated with concocting meals . The benefits associated with providing quality sustenance extend far beyond physical nourishment ; eating together provides excellent opportunity developing social skills such those necessary build relationships strengthen bonds between students faculty alike . By implementing policies encourage dialogue",1
"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He has classified six basic emotions - happiness,suprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness each characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raise your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris(around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an efective human instructor. The same technology can make computer -animatedfaces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. I belive it can read your emotional expressions better than a average human can because it can scan your face and see what your emotion is even if you pretend to be happy and your not.

"Sports activities are an essential part of physical and mental development in young people. Unfortunately, access to these activities is often limited when students are required to achieve a certain grade in order to participate. This is an unfair practice, for several reasons.

First, it sets up a false dichotomy between academics and athletics, an artificial separation that should not exist. Students should be encouraged to excel in both areas. Sports, in particular, can foster resilience and provide a constructive outlet for frustration or disappointment with academic performance.

Second, using grades to limit athletics unfairly disadvantages those students who are already at a disadvantage. The flip side of this coin is that students who already excel in academics are given extra incentive to keep up their performance, while students who struggle are left behind.

Finally, and most importantly, sports activities help young people develop lifelong skills and friendships. These experiences should not be denied to students based on one area of performance. Athletics is an essential part of holistic education, and too often we forget to think of it as such.

For these reasons, it is highly unfair to limit access to sports based on grade requirements. It is our job as educators to ensure that all students have equal opportunity to participate.",1
"Dear, senator

I honestely think that it should be popular vote instaed of the electoral college. i think that because its going to effect our lives, our way of living, and how our way of life is going to work. If we pick a president then thats who we wanted now what a group of people want.

Having a popular vote is the same thing but with more people and more accurate.

The way we like to live is the better wa, not being forced on how to live our lives. It is also a faster prosses to vote. If the group all are equal then they have to wait a longer time to see who the presedent is going to be and no one wants that. If i can ask you one question its going to be how long will you be willing to wait to see who the new presedent id going to be? The people of nthe united states dont want to wait, they want to see who the presedent is going to be the week after they vote.

Can we live the way we want to live

? can we live our lives without something happening that changes everything? Most of the time no, there is always something/someone that changes things in our lives. Like in 2001 the twin towers got hit by a plane, that changed everything. the way we go through airports, the way we fly, the way how people find jobs, and how people look and their beliefs. Some people are judged by what they do for living or what they look like , but thats the point of freedome in the united states. If we have a popular vote in the US they most of that will change and i can garantee that more laws will be fast that will help the US.

I'm going to agree with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. they all wanted the electoral collede to be abolished. there is no need to have them if we have the people in out states. The people in out states have a big use in voting. without the people then whats the use in being in states why not just one big land. Every state has its own way of voting but the peoples votes really dont mean anything with the electoral college. The electoral college just take over voting and wont let the people oppinions work in voting. Without them our votes will mean something, not just thrown away and just be forgotten.

If they stay they should be used for emergencies . If by any chance everyone has a tie they should be the tie breaker.

Most ruls shouldnt just be in texas or california.

They should occure in all states.

why do only two states get special treatment? If every state had tghe same rulls do you think it would be more fair to all the states? If not then i dont know what to say, because im pretty sure in one of the amendmendments it states thats every human being will be treated equal no matter what.So this is my tought on how we should vote and that is by popular vote..",0
"Not too long ago I got into a disagreement with one of my best friends, this made me a little sad. But something that always helped me feel better was talking to trusted people about it. Receiving opinions from multiple people can help someone decide on a better choice because they can view the other persons perspective, they will get honest feedback, and they might find out more information on the situation.

Getting advice from different people can help you see multiple perspectives on the situation. The trusted person helping you can show you how the other person might be feeling. Sometimes knowing how they feel can change your point of view on things. The friend or family member can inform you on what you did wrong. Even if the opposing person hurt your feelings, there is a high chance you have hurt them as well! If you are confused on what the problem is they can show you what it is or how it started. For me, I need to understand how the problem started before I resolve it. Understanding how the other person felt, knowing what the problem is, and realizing what you did wrong are important things the trusted people helping you can do for you to make a better choice.

The person you are seeking advice from can inform you with more facts about the situation. They might have gone through the same thing in the past and know how to handle it. I feel a sense of relief to know that they understand what I am going through. If you are talking to a friend they will most likely already know about the situation and can help you out more than you think. Depending on how much they know, you'll have a clear understanding of what happened and feel comfortable enough to make a good decision. Another way you can get more knowledge is figuring out how you can prevent this from happening again in the future. That is something you're gonna need! Getting advice from someone who already knows about the problem, has dealt with the same thing in the past, and keeping the advice for the future are perfect reasons why you should seek advice from not just one person, but a few.

Lastly, the trusted person who is helping you will give you honest feedback. They will help you choose the best way to handle the situation. It always makes me feel better when the person giving me advice knows how to help me. The person can tell you if your choice is the best or not. You will most likely feel better after getting the okay from another person. Talking to a trusted person will make you feel more comfortable, especially knowing you aren't getting lied to. By then you will feel ready to make a great choice. Knowing if your decision is good or not, being told how to handle it, and talking to someone who won't lie to you will truly help you decide on a better choice.

Asking people for advice can sometimes help you make a better choice. Viewing other peoples perspective, getting more information on the topic, and getting honest feedback can help you decide on a better choice. Do you thing talking to more than one person can help you make a better choice?",0
" What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! Well i think otherwise. Electoral College is a process, not a place , which the election of the President is by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College do consists of choosing the electors, reasons to keep the Electoral College method of choosing the president.

The start of the Electoral College is well handingly choosing the electors, which consists of 538 electors each of course must be qualified. Most of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. The number of members in its Congressional delegation is equal to the entitled allotment of electors in your state, one is for each member in the house of Representatives plus two for the Senators. For the purposes of Electoral College, Columbia District is allowed 3 electors and is treat like a state. and when i say state for this topic i mean the District of Columbia.

Well backed up reasons to keep the Electoral College method of choosing the president, A outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, just look back at the year 2000 it was less likely then a come over the popular vote the Reason for that is the winning candidate's share of the Electioral College expanded his share of the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.

Electoral College is a process, not a place  each and every step of the Electoral college method comes out to be a well handed system. Its more then enough fairness included when choosing the Presisent and Vice President. Popular vote is more based on winner-take-all System thats awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate, unlike the Electoral College which is a process that consists of choosing the electors, reasons to keep the Electoral College method of choosing the president.",0
"Should or Shouldn't people use their phones while driving?

What my opinion on this topic is no and the reason why I say this because people (mostly teenagers) can't focus when they have a phone in the car, they will keep using it which causes them to get distracted like for example in a BBC article they estimated that all 6% of car accidents happen because people were on their mobile phones this also means that 12,000 serious injuries and 2,600 deaths each year in the U.S. And on the news on April 8, 2019, a teen who was speeding at 106 mph while on the social media app Snapchat got in a car accident with her friend but because she was paying attention got her friend killed and now that teen will be faced with 15 years in prison and many more like this happened to teens, adults, elders, etc.

Because of them using their mobile phones while driving and not paying attention to the road.

Therefore, I say that people shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving hands-free or not because it causes a lot of accidents each year and if we don't act fast then we will just keep losing the ones we love.",0
"In the first story it is talking about how cars aren't really drivin near the French and Swiss. Though theyallow the cars they just allow them to be parked in only two places: the car-owner buys a space or it to, $40,000 along with the home, or large garages at the edge of the development.

David Goldberg said  All of our development since World War ll has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

Paris, France has enforeced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city. Diesel fuel was blamed, since diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the Western Europe.

In Bogota, Colombia they ban cars altogether. they go rid of the roads and made them into sidwalks. Now that people have to walk to get to their final destination a lot of people now go to the parks and to the sports centers that they have there.

President Obama's goals are to curb the United States ' greenhouse gas emissions will get a fortuitous assit from the incipient shift in American behavior. Obama said that if we Americans buy less cars then there would be less drivers lisenes each year and fewer driving altoether.",0
"Smog, acid rain, high carbondioxide levels, all of these things are due to pollution. In many countries the leaders have put a ban towards cars. Paris France, Vauban Germany, Bogota Colombia, and even the United States of America haveare thinking about putting a ban on cars or other transporting objects. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage limiting pollutians in the air, saving money, and having a healthier life style.

Cars can cost a pretty penny epically if their new, and many lowmiddle class family's have trouble keeping up with the bills that come with a car. Car payments alone can run up to 300 a month. Then theirs insurance, and if your car happends to need a change of oil, or breaks theirs another 200300 dollar payment. That's why people are starting to buy fewer and fewer cars each year. After the peek in 2005 car percheses have droped tremendously, with less people deciding to get a license.

Not getting you license dosn't mean you cant get around, it just means that you have to find other means of transportation. Biking, walking, even riding on your skateboard can get you from point A to point B. Cars are bigining to become obsolete, not being used in large suburbs, or highly populated cities. People have started to walk to work and that has a largee impact on health. With people having privet cars they dont feel the need to have physical activity every day. This could be contributing to obesity. With cars being out of mind people are starting to get exersize just by walking to work. Cars have also contributed to many deaths all over the world. With new technology coming out many drivers get distracted. Wether its talking on their phones, trying to pick up something thats' dropped in the back seat, or even trying to dig something out of your purse. Not all drivers are a fault tho, many other accidents happen because of pedestrians not paying attention. These accidents could be prevented though, by just getting rid of the use of cars.

Passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gass additions in europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the Unites States. If we got rid of most privetly owned cars though, it world bring that pecentige down tremendously. In Paris the record high pollution finally had them pass a partial driving ban untill the thick smog cleard the city streets. congestion was down 60% in the streets of paris, and after 5 days of intensifying smog it had finally cleard.

Cars all over the world are slowly becoming less and less used. This could help the pollution, health and save money. these advantiges to getting rid of cars is going to become a topic thast we will talk alot about for ages, until cars become compleetly and totaly obsolite.",0
"As our school's principal, I'm sure you are aware of the rising issue of phone usage in classrooms. There is no denying that there are certain drawbacks to allowing phones to be used in schools, such as potential for distraction and abuse of technology. Fortunately, I believe that policy number 1 concerning phone usage can bring more benefits than drawbacks to our students.

For starters, many students use their phones for organizational purposes, such as setting reminders of upcoming assignments and activities. By allowing these students to access their phones in moderation during class, they are able to stay on top of their studies and stay productive. This will help to promote a more academic and organized atmosphere in our classes.

Additionally, using phones can be a great educational resource. Through apps and websites, students have access to a wealth of information which can foster greater student engagement and facilitate more meaningful class discussions. Furthermore, students can use their phones to snap photos of course materials and diagrams for future reference. 

Allowing students to use their phones during class can bring about many educational benefits which aid in fostering an enriching learning environment. I therefore believe that policy number 1 concerning phone usage is the most beneficial for our students.",1
"Phones & Driving Essay

Should drivers be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle? No, drivers shouldn't be able to be on their phones because that is putting other people's life at risk. You need to be 100% paying attention to the road and others on it. Most accidents happen when people are on their phones because your looking down. Also the person you are texting or social media page your on is not more important than your life. But if it's an emergency call you should answer otherwise put phones down you are taking other people's life for an electronic the phone isn't going nowhere but your life can. You should not be able to use your phone while operating a vehicle never.

Although, Georgia has made it illegal to be on your cellphones while driving people still do not listen. But, the accidents percentages in Atlanta and Gwinnett county has decreased by 30% that's a good start and if you come here you would see signs posted around talking about these things. We have to start convincing others to do the right thing because we don't want them to realize when it's to late. Also another solution is to enforce this law around the United States and more people need to get punished for it. That means that the law enforcement has to be on their job and not let people get away with it.

In conclusion, people need to stop being selfish and care about everyone else lives as well people have families to come home two. If more people enforce these rules you should see a change or if people just listen things will be different. Wrecks still happen besides this problem but majority happens from this and DUI.",0
"Thank god I got to talk to mom, dads advice was horrible. Generic_Name said, as he finally learned how to tie his shoe. This is just one of many instances of how getting more than one person to help you with something is beneficial. Some people think that more than one opinion can be confusing or make people over think but in the end it helps you more than it hurts you. 2nd or 3rd opinions can make you look at things from a different point of view, it can also make people reflect on a bad decision and finally it can make someone better at giving advice. Therefore multiple opinions are great and can really help you grow as a person.

First Off like said in the 1st paragraph 2nd and 3rd opinions will help you look at things from a different point of view. It could make you change your mind or even make you see something from a way you never could've imagined. For Example, lets say you wanted to go out late with your friends to watch a movie and your dad says yes, but then you run it by your mom and she reminds that even though it's a Friday night you have a game tomorrow. So you take into account what your mom says and you stay home. The next day you score 3 goals and one of those goals were the game winning goal. Now what if you had listened to your dad who had disregarded the fact that you had game and complete forgot. But thankfully, you listened to your mom who reminded you that you had a game although you completely forgot. This ties back to the fact that 2nd opinions make you look at things from a different point of view. You could've easily just gone to the movies with out remembering that you had a game. But because you asked your mom she reminded you that you had a game and saved you from trouble in the next morning. Another example is, when people are hurt or sick and they go to the doctor sometimes that first, second or even third doctor dont know whats going on but if you choose to accept your fate you'll truly never know whats going on. Now imagine that you went to that 5th doctor and he helps you realize that that head ache wasn't from working out. It was from lack of sleep. Now your on the right medication and living your best life. All because you kept asking you now have headache free days this ties back to the fact that second or 3rd opinions can make you look at things from a different point of view if he had just quit he would still have that headache but the 5th doctor made him realize that the headache wasn't from working out it was from lack of sleep.

Next, multiple opinions can help you reflect on bad decisions. If you make the wrong decision even after you get advice from multiple people maybe you won't need there advice at all next time. For example, if you had forgot to do homework even though your teacher had reminded you to do it but your friends told you to play video games with them instead and now you have an F in the class maybe next time you'll go with your gut instead and just do the homework. This ties back to the fact that multiple opinions can help you reflect on bad decisions because now you know that school comes first and you won't need to ask anyone when it comes to that. Another example is what if you want to go out with your friends but you know if you go out this weekend you cant go out next weekend so you ask your first friend and he tells you to just go out but then you ask your other friend and he reminds you that theres a big party next week. You end up listening to your first friend and miss the big party next week all because you were inpatient. Now next time I bet you wont miss the party.

Finally, multiple opinions can help you give other people opinions. If you here different perspectives from multiple people it will help you be more wise and maybe next time you will be able to help out other people. For example,imagine your brother asks you for advice on how to make the baseball team and you remember that multiple coaches told you the most important thing was to always hustle so than you tell your brother that and he make the team. This reflects on the fact that multiple opinions can make you more wise because if he hadn't known about that who knows maybe his brother doesn't make the team. Another example is, imagine you friend is nervous before a test but you remember the advice all the teachers gave you. You give him the advice and he gets an 100% on the test. Without your advice he would've failed. Therefore multiple opinions will grow your wisdom and that will help others as well.

In the end multiple opinions are a key factor on everyday success, like said in the story it helps you look at things from a different point of view, it can also make people reflect on a bad decision and finally it can make someone better at giving advice. Therefore it helps you more than it hurts you so you should get multiple opinions in life you never know how it could benefit you.",0
"Have you ever been asked for advice? Or asked for advice from someone? Or even a group of people? Well, I have. I believe that if you ask multiple people for advice, it could be very beneficial towards you. If multiple people help your situations, in which you asked for advice on, it can help you see different point of views and come to a better decision. All of this can improve the very important life skills of perspective and open mindedness.

Now, you might be thinking to yourself, She's crazy, I only need one persons advice. Well, imagine how much better it would be to look at your situations from different angles. Wouldn't that be pretty nice? By getting multiple peoples inputs, you are also raising your trait of perspective. What is perspective, you ask? Perspective is being able to look at a situation and not just picture one scenario or solution, but multiple. This trait can get you very far in life. An example is if a student applies to colleges, he or she needs to look at multiple reasons to pick that specific school.

Another reason on why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one is because not only will you gain more knowledge about one trait, you'll gain two. The other trait is open mindedness. Have you ever heard someone say, You have to be more open minded.? Well, what they mean by that is that you or whoever they're talking to, has to not be so closed in on one idea. One of my personal experiences, is when I was doing kick boxing. I did kick boxing my whole life and I loved it, but that doesn't mean it's the only sport I can do for the rest of my life. So, I decided to do volleyball too. I did this because I had to be open minded to other sports other than kick boxing.

My last reason is about the people you get advice from. I don't know about you, but I have multiple people in my life who are important, not just one. You probably do too. The people you get you advice from, can be crucial to your decision. I only ask for advice from people I trust such as family, teachers, and my best friend. People you trust and love most likely trust and love you just as much or maybe even more. If they don't want to see you hurt or unsuccessful, they wouldn't give you bad advice. When I need advice, I ask my mom, my grandma, and my best friend. I do this because they all give support to the answers they give me. Also, if it is a yes or no question, I can use the majority rules system.

In conclusion, asking for advice from multiple people will make the decision more successful than just asking one person. This is because you will learn and gain very important life skills such as perspective and open mindedness, and because you can ask multiple people that you adore and trust. Now tell me, what will you do with your advice next time? Ask one person? Or two? Or maybe even more? Next time, use these examples to think about how many people to ask for advice.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
In recent years, there has been a growing trend in limiting car usage in various parts of the world. Encouragingly, this movement is gaining momentum as societies become more conscious of the negative impacts of excessive car dependency. The advantages of reducing car usage are numerous and span across environmental, social, and economic factors. By restricting car ownership and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, and walking, communities can reap the benefits of smarter planning and a more sustainable future.

Body Paragraph One: Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Limiting car usage is crucial in the fight against climate change. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. In Europe, they contribute to 12 percent of emissions, rising to as high as 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing reliance on automobiles, we can significantly decrease the carbon footprint associated with transportation. This is especially important as countries strive to meet emission reduction targets and transition towards a more sustainable future.

Body Paragraph Two: Enhancing Urban and Suburban Planning
Restricting car usage allows for more efficient and sustainable urban and suburban planning. Suburban communities like Vauban in Germany and Bogota in Colombia have already implemented car-free zones or days, demonstrating the benefits of this approach. In these neighborhoods, streets are designed with pedestrians and cyclists in mind, with homes, shops, and amenities located within walking or cycling distance. This approach promotes exercise, reduces traffic congestion, and enhances community interaction. By prioritizing public transportation and infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists, cities and suburbs can create more livable and accessible spaces for their residents.

Body Paragraph Three: Economic Considerations
Contrary to popular belief, limiting car usage can have positive economic impacts. A reduction in car ownership and usage leads to decreased demand for fuel and automobile-related expenses. Families can save money by utilizing alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or cycling. Moreover, the reallocation of resources from building and maintaining roads and parking spaces can be redirected towards other pressing needs, such as improving public transportation networks or investing in renewable energy infrastructure. Overall, limiting car usage can create economic opportunities and alleviate financial burdens for individuals and communities.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted and have far-reaching implications for our environment, society, and economy. By implementing smart planning strategies, communities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, foster healthier and more livable neighborhoods, and stimulate economic growth. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Bogota in Colombia, and other cities around the world demonstrate that it is possible to create sustainable and car-free environments. As we strive for a more sustainable future, it is imperative that we continue to prioritize alternative forms of transportation and explore innovative ways to transform our communities into car-reduced or even car-free spaces.",1
"There are many reasons why people might disagree with the idea that the government should spend more money on medical care and education over building sports stadiums and theaters. One reason is that people might believe that spending on these types of projects will create more jobs and stimulate the economy. Another reason is that people might believe that spending on these types of projects will help to improve the quality of life for the people who live in the country.

Some specific reasons why people might believe that the government should spend more money on medical care and education over building sports stadiums and theaters are as follows:

1. Medical care is necessary for both the rich and the poor, and it is important that everyone has access to it.

2. Education is necessary for both the rich and the poor, and it is important that everyone has access to it.

3. Building sports stadiums and theaters often costs a lot of money, and this money could be better spent on other things.

4. Sports stadiums and theaters often do not have a positive impact on the economy, and they can actually have a negative impact on the economy.

5. The quality of life for the people who live in a country can be improved by spending money on medical care and education instead of building sports stadiums and theaters.",1
"The Face on Mars

The Face on Mars is a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head, as NASA stated in 1976.

Many know that it is just a natural landform like on earth, but some believe that the Face was created by aliens.

The Face is nothing more than a natural landform because we have landforms like it here on earth, photographic evidence reveals a natural landform, and there is no evidence that the Face was built by life outside of earth.

The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform, just like we have on earth.

Jim Garvin, who is the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, knows that the Face is just another landform.

It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, he said, That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

This is just one piece of evidence that the Face cannot be anything more than a natural landform--because it has many characteristics of a landform here on earth.

A second reason that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform is because of the images taken in 2001 by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).

Twenty five years after its first photographs, clearer, higher resolution photos of Face came from MGS.

From the 43 meters per pixel in the 1976 photograph versus the 1.56 meters per pixel in the 2001 photograph, there is clearly enough evidence that the Face on Mars is just a natural land formation similar to a mesa.

The rises and dips in the landform just resemble the shape of eyes, nose, and mouth of a human face and nothing more, but after seen more clearly, cracks and crevaces in the land prove that the Face is just a natural landform.

Those who believe that the Face on Mars was built by aliens have nothing to base their beliefs on other than the fact that the landform resembles a face.

No evidence whatsoever suggests that the Face was built by supernatural life.

On the other hand, photos--and common sense itself--prove that the landform is just another landform like we have on earth.

The passage itself proves the authenticity of the landform.

It says that thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.

There was no alien monument at all, proving that the Face is only a landform.

To conclude, no evidence suggests that the Face on Mars is anything more than a natural landform.

The Face has characteristics of a landform on earth, and images of it from 2001 reveal only a landform.

On top of that, those who believe that alien activity is responsible for the creation of the Face have little to no information to base their beliefs on.

In the end, though, we know that the little landform called the Face of Mars is just one of our universe's great mysteries.",0
"The field of mathematics is an important part of the foundation for much of human progress. It has been used throughout history to unlock new insights, solve problems, and make calculations that would have been impossible without it. From the ancient Egyptians counting with their hands to modern-day computers making complex calculations in a fraction of a second, mathematical knowledge and applications have enabled us to stretch our boundaries and explore new realms. Mathematics is so pervasive that it can be found everywhere: from building construction plans, engineering projects, consumer pricing models, scientific formulas; all the way down to simple everyday activities like cooking recipes or balancing checkbooks. Its use allows us to gain insight into patterns not easily visible on first glance—such as predicting future trends in stock markets or forecasting weather patterns over time—and brings structure and order out of chaos. Without mathematics we would struggle to get by on some basic tasks such as calculating discounts at stores or even telling the time! Mathematics also contributes heavily to other fields like economics and finance where equations are used for predictive modeling purposes in order for companies or governments to plan ahead financially more accurately. In addition math helps explain phenomenon like gravity which underlies many physical events seen throughout our universe including planetary motion and climate change here on earth as well as being vital towards astronomical observations facilitating navigation aids such satellites enabling GPS tracking systems across multiple devices worldwide today! Math has thus become increasingly integral within technology itself too since computer algorithms rely heavily upon its concepts & principles when executing tasks efficiently & effectively - whether this be through data analysis machine learning artificial intelligence etcetera! Finally let’s not forget medical research either particularly concerning statistical methods helping scientists understand diseases better develop treatments accordingly improve patient outcomes statistics help ensure clinical trials go smoothly provide reliable results track changes over time monitor patients post treatment etcetera again leading towards improved healthcare provisioning overall!. From its humble beginnings thousands of years ago until now we can truly appreciate how far math has come in providing solutions",1
"I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. For example, I have heard students say that they do not understand why the Earth is round, or why the sky is blue. These students need to be more understanding and learn more about concepts before they can learn about the physical world around them.

Another example is the concept of time. Many students do not understand how time works, or how it affects their day-to-day lives. To learn more about time, students need to understand concepts such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, and months. This is important because students need to be able to understand how their day is structured and how time affects their lives.

In conclusion, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This is because understanding concepts is the key to being able to understand the physical world around them.",1
"In the passage Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto. I belive that the new technology the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. It could help in schools by helping you not be so bored and confused. Also, it could help you tell how your friends are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.

This technology could be what schools need to keep their students awake and interacting. In the passage Dr. Huang says  A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. If a computer could predict when a student was bored or confused and do something to change that it would change the amount of people who actually learn something drastically.

The software can help get rid of unwanted ads that annoy you and bring up the ones you like by something so simple. In the passage it says If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similiar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. With the new software doing that it would save alot of frustration from having to click the x button on all the ads that you dont care for.

WIth the new technology it i that it is a benefit to our generation. All of the old paintings that we could look at and tell the mood, history teachers would have a field day. I belive that the new technology the Facial Action Coding System is valuable",0
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passage set provides several examples of the positive impacts of reducing car dependence, such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a shift towards more sustainable and inclusive transportation systems.

One of the key benefits of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. The passages highlight the substantial role that cars play in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of these emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the figure can reach up to 50%. This is a significant contribution to climate change and air pollution. By reducing car usage, we can decrease carbon emissions and improve air quality, creating a healthier environment for everyone.

Another advantage of limited car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation modes. The passage set showcases examples from different countries, such as the car-free day in Bogota and the transformation of suburbs in Germany to be more accessible to public transportation. These initiatives encourage the use of buses, bikes, and walking, which are more sustainable and can help to reduce traffic congestion. By providing better infrastructure and incentives for using these modes of transport, we can create more efficient and accessible urban environments.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog mentions that congestion decreased by 60%. This implies that reducing car usage can improve traffic flow and decrease commuting times, leading to increased productivity and economic efficiency. Furthermore, there can be cost savings for individuals who rely less on cars. The passage about Vauban, Germany, mentions that 70% of families in the community do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. This suggests that households can save money by not having to maintain and fuel cars, and instead use more cost-effective transportation options.

While there may be concerns about the impact of limiting car usage on personal mobility and convenience, the passage set suggests that these challenges can be mitigated. The introduction of car-sharing programs and the development of better public transportation systems provide viable alternatives to car ownership. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as carpooling apps and bike-sharing programs, make these alternative modes of transportation more accessible and convenient.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, ranging from environmental benefits and reduced greenhouse gas emissions to improved traffic flow and economic efficiency. By promoting alternative transportation modes and investing in sustainable infrastructure, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly communities.",1
"In The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The text states many facts and statistics; therefore, the author supports this idea well, for he/she describes why astronomers are amazed by Venus, what NASA is planning on approaching the planet, and explaining the type of challenge it is to explore this dangerous Evening Star. Reading the passage, the author is convincing about the subject that he/she has chosen.

The planet, Venus, is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, as the author suggests. Supporting this idea, the author shows many examples, facts, and ideas why he/she thinks Venus is a worthy planet to keep studying, for the text states, Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. The writer describes that important studies come out of exploring Venus's reputation, even though it is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author supports the claim that Venus has many thrilling factors in Paragraph 3. Paragraph 3, Line 6 states, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface. The author demonstrates his knowledge telling the readers that Venus cause many disasterous events that happen all around the world.

As the author claims that Venus is worth studying for, Paragraphs 4 through 7 shows evidence about scientists still studying Venus as of today and why geologists and atronomers are so fascinated with the blazing planet. In Paragraph 4, Line 2 states, Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Scientists state that even today, Venus has features that look like mountains, as read in the passage. Testing his knowledge in the prompt, the author demonstrates that NASA wants to make visiting Venus possible. Throughout Paragraphs 5 through 7, it states what NASA's (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) plan is to successfully observing Venus from a up-close point of view. In Paragraph 5, Line 2 and 3 state, NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. As being stated as a possible solution, the author shows NASA's solution is not an effecient plan, for Paragraph 6, Lines 1 through 4 state, However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. In the authors statement, NASA need samples of rocks, gas, and other types of samples to have a full discovery of Venus. Because of the obstacle in NASA's way, they decide to make other approaches to studying Venus, for they understand that meeting to Venus' standards will take years. Lastly, as the author's final example on why Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents is in Paragraph 8, which states, Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Or travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. The narrator claims that exploring all of our options that have dangers should not limit us as human beings to give up and quit. He/she states that we should move along all of the doubts and dangers and increase our imagination on all levels.

In The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. As the author states many facts on why scientists should continue their research on Venus, he/she supports their claim well. The passage describes why astronomers study Venus as well as what NASA is planning to do to approach the Evening Star. The writer believes that although Venus has many dangers to humans, we should take the challenge exploring Venus offers to us and go beyond our limits to achieve the goal that geologists, astronomers, and scientists want to acquire.",0
"The state senator that is reading this should understand that in my favor keeping the Electoral College is the wise thing to do. It will avoid run-off elections and how it always has a process if something happens and that the process is fair-hence Electoral College would be the best.

To start off, the Electoral College helps with elections be cause it avoids run-off elections. In other words it keeps us from running into problem where neither candidate gets the majority of the the votes cast. For example, in 1968 president Nixon and Clinton in 1992 each had 43 percent of the popular votes but because their electoral votes  was 301 to 370 it does matter so this means it was a run-off election until the percentage of votes changed. The Electoral College soon produces a clear winner. This is just solving a problem where no candidate recieves the majority of votes. Now there is only one con to the Electoral College and that is that it may turn off people from voting because they believe that their vote out of everybody who votes isnt enough to do a difference so they dont even vote. So voters in presidential elections are way better than just one vote deciding an election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College is consisted of 538 electors. The candidate needs atleast 270 to be elected. If they have atleast 270 and there and they are not tied, but they have the same popular votes, also known as a plurality. The Electoral Colleges 538 electors will decide. This is 100 percent fair because those electors study this, they do this for their job, and they understand. They make up for the people who didn't vote. So just think, wouldnt you want 538 professional electors deciding whos president or 538 people who dont even want to vote and dont even know about the campaign to decide whos your president. All the lying about the Electoral College that it is an anachronism is false it is a success. This is common sense if you ask me.

To conclude, the electoral college has been good to us for a long time because of how it handles situations when they go wrong-hence it is the best, why change it now?",0
"Mobile phone use while driving is very common. It is widely considered ver dangerous to drive while on your phone. It has been a numerous numbers of crashes while people have been driving and on a cellphone. Some people might feel that driving while on cellphone is okay, but it has been reported to be illegal. Overall using a cellphone increases driver's risk of causing a crash or death to a family, or person. Driver's are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more crashes.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not just yourself. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cellphones whether they want to or not. Driving is a privilege and some people take it for granted.

Driving you have to be very careful for yourself and for other drivers. One minute you're here and next your gone because you were on your phone or not paying attention to the road or other drivers that driving on the other side of the road or by you. It is only a matter of seconds before you are dead and gone.

Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity while driving. Texting while driving is becoming a life-threatening norm for people driving. With inexperienced drivers with lack of skills, cell phones use can especially deadly for teen drivers. It has been many deaths from car crashes while on a cellphone. Adults for the most part can't ever stay of their phones, cause every time I'm driving I see it.

In conclusion because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced parents need to take action. It isn't a good idea for you to drive while on the phone because it can cause serious danger. Also parents should avoid calling their teen while he or she is driving. Instead ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel attempted to answer a parent's call if received while driving. Stay off your phone while driving, it isn't safe while driving.",0
"Every day, millions of Americans take a single pill, called Prozac. This small blue capsule carries big implications for treating mental health issues like depression and anxiety. While there are other ways to treat these conditions, it's clear that Prozac has had a profound impact on improving the quality of life for many people. Prozac works by increasing levels of serotonin in the body, which is a chemical responsible for regulating moods and emotions. By doing this, it helps to counteract feelings of sadness or hopelessness that can come with depression or severe anxiety. It also helps reduce stress and physical tension associated with these same disorders - making it easier to feel calm and relaxed throughout the day. Another benefit of taking Prozac is its ability to help break down negative thought patterns and behaviors related to mental illness such as self-harming behavior or obsessive thinking about certain topics. With increased serotonin levels in the body comes improved cognitive functioning including better memory recall and decision-making skills which can be greatly advantageous when trying to manage difficult emotions or situations while dealing with mental illness symptoms at hand. Although there are potential side effects associated with taking Prozac (such as nausea, insomnia, headaches etc), most people find that these pass relatively quickly after beginning treatment so are willing to tolerate them in order to receive its benefits overall; particularly those who suffer from debilitating forms of depression where traditional therapy may not be sufficient enough on its own. In addition, given how common various psychological problems have become due largely in part due stresses from modern life - having access to an effective medication like Prozac has been invaluable in terms of providing relief from their symptoms without having any major risks involved compared other pharmacological treatments available today (e.g antipsychotics). Overall therefore we can see just why this drug has been so successful since its release way back in 1987 - helping millions worldwide lead more balanced lives through reducing their symptoms relating too common mental illnesses such as Anxiety Disorder/Panic",1
"An opinion can act like a guiding hand in a dark tunnel, said Generic_Name. Sometimes we find ourselves in situations where we have no idea what to do. Whether to take a right or a left or take one job over another. The decisions we make effect how we live for the rest of our lives. So, it is important that we make our decisions with careful thought, and when we need help with our decisions that we reach out to the people we trust for guidance. I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help us make better decisions because some people are wiser than others, some people know you better, and because some people have really strong opinions for or against something without considering what is best for you.

First, wiser people who have had to make difficult decisions might give better advice rather than someone who has had a perfect life. Adults and elders are a great example of that because they have had to make serious and difficult decisions that have shaped them into who they are today. They have lived through so many of the struggles we go through and they understand the emotions and fear that contribute to our decision making. Those adults and elders have more than likely had to make the same exact decision that we are struggling to make, so they can use past experiences to lead us in the right direction.

Other people might know you better, and regardless of the situation they do what is best for you. Those are the people I listen to most, because they know you and know what you should do based off of who you are as a person. Right now I am facing a difficult decision of choosing between my friends, who have been fake recently, or a boy, who can never seem to make up his mind. I have asked so many different people for advice on what I should do, and the opinion that suck out the most was the one of my closest friends. She told me that I needed to follow my heart and do what I thought was best regardless of what other people thought I should do. No matter what I do in this situation I'm losing a big part of me and the people that have made me who I am, but it's relieving to know that the people who know what type of person I am support me in whatever decision I make.

Lastly, we sometimes listen to those who have a strong opinion for or against something without even considering what is best for you. Those people are very selfish, and if we aren't careful we will listen to them. In my boy vs. friends situation I have asked these type of people whose opinions are so strong, rather it's what is best for me or not. They're so for one side and their opinions are so strong it seems like they know they are talking about. They often times have very good arguments on why they think what they think and what they are saying might be true. However, it isn't always what I need to hear or what is best for me and my life.

That is why seeking all these different opinions can help us make the best decision. Some people have very good arguments while others just know us better. If we only listened to one person our whole life when it came to decision making our life would turn into theirs and we would practically be living the life they want to live. I especially don't want someone to be living through me and controlling my life through different mind games. It is important that we listen to what others have told us, but we form our own opinions and do what we think is best for us. The decision that we make for ourselves will most likely be the best decision.",0
"To the senator of florida, I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When americans vote they're supposedly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.

Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an favored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallop poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.

Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly proffered president according to source 3, there is however some flaws to these so called pros. Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occurred in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without establishing a president, though it can happen again.

We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college.",0
"In the stories and beyond, The Face is classified as one of aliens artifacts. As a scienctist this peice of information is to be told unreal.

In part of the discussion this evidence is told false as well, some workers there have shown that this is known to be a anatural landform on the planet which created during different phases in the weather. A team of Global Surveyor has flew over to tell that there was no known pictures/image of an alien monument. In conclusion, the story was very fictional there was no evidence on known alien only something else. It also made more since if was only peices of rocks that has collided together to form this image which would be a good topic to use.",0
"Having a positive attitude in life can have a plethora of benefits, such as helping us to achieve our goals and create more meaningful relationships. Studies have shown that those with a positive outlook can have better job performance, increased motivation, higher levels of productivity, and even improved physical health. Staying positive during difficult times is not easy, but taking a few moments to appreciate the little things in life and cultivating an attitude of gratitude can help to maintain a positive outlook. On the flip side, being aware of the impact your attitude has on those around you is also essential. Helping someone through a rough patch, consciously engaging emotive language, and relaying a few words of encouragement can go a long way in uplifting someone’s spirits. Ultimately, having a positive attitude all comes back to having a thoughtful, growth-oriented approach to life that can make a difference in your own life and in the lives of others around you.",1
"The rapid growth of technology has been both a positive and negative influence on modern life. With the recent advancements in mobile devices, many people have the opportunity to access information at any time; however, this convenience can lead to an unhealthy obsession with technology. As more and more people become reliant on their phones for communication, entertainment, or other purposes, we must be conscious of how our attachment to these devices affects our lives. One concern that arises from over-reliance on technology is its potential effect on social relationships. While texting or online chatting may provide individuals with an easy way to maintain contact with friends and family members, it can also lead to decreased face-to-face interaction which is essential for meaningful relationships. When given the choice between meeting up in person or communicating through text messages or social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, many people are opting for the latter option due to its convenience. This shift away from personal connections could cause a disconnection within society if not managed properly by reducing excessive use of electronic devices when possible but still allowing enough usage so that we don’t miss out important moments in life like spending quality time with loved ones. Another issue related to overuse of technology is addiction which can manifest itself in a variety of ways including neglecting physical needs such as food and sleep because one cannot seem to put down their phone long enough for basic bodily functions necessary for proper health maintenance as well as suffering from anxiety when separated from their device even momentarily due extreme dependency upon it . The pleasure derived from being constantly connected via notifications has created negative side effects such dizziness , restlessness , mood swings etc., due too much exposure radiations emitted by mobile phones leading psychologically unstable behaviour known as nomophobia (fear of losing connection). Furthermore there are issues regarding cyberbullying prevalent nowadays among teenagers who spend excessive amounts of time surfing internet without adequate supervision while they should rather focus more on developing skills needed later in real life than merely wasting hours playing",1
"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Operating a Vehicle

In today's world, the majority of people rely heavily on their cell phones to stay connected. However, using a cell phone while driving has become a serious safety hazard. There are several compelling reasons why drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle.

The main concern is that cell phone use greatly distracts drivers from focusing fully on the road. Whether talking, texting, or using apps, a driver's attention is drawn away from their primary task of safely navigating traffic. Numerous studies have shown that even hands-free use of cell phones leads to distracted driving. Our brains can only focus on one task at a time, so any cell phone interaction divides a driver's attention between conversing and driving. This puts not only the driver but also other motorists and pedestrians at risk.

Moreover, research shows that driving while distracted by a cell phone reduces reaction times as much as having a blood alcohol content at the legal limit of intoxication. Sending or reading a text takes a driver's eyes off the road for approximately five seconds. At 55 mph, that's enough time to cover the length of a football field without looking at the roadway. These kinds of distractions exponentially increase the chances of an accident from occurring. 

Finally, allowing any cell phone use encourages dangerous behaviors that are difficult to enforce. Even call-free modes like hands-free can still distract many drivers. Moreover, it may be challenging for law enforcement to determine if a driver was talking versus texting if an accident happens. A total ban on cell phone use provides a clear, blanket rule that is unambiguous and easier for police to enforce.

In conclusion, the serious safety hazards of distracted driving necessitate a complete ban on cell phone use behind the wheel. Driving requires full attention, and anything that takes a person's eyes and mind off the road should be prohibited to keep all travelers safe. The responsibility of driving diligently outweighs any need or urge to use a phone while in control of a potentially lethal moving vehicle.",1
"When people ask for advice , they sometimes talk to more than one person. Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it.

In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if

Abraham

Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. Only instead its intellects make the right choice to help you.

In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor. But just hear them out and be the best you that you want to be shaped in, advice will make yo wiser and more aware of scenarios.",0
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my strong support for changing our presidential election system to one decided by popular vote rather than the Electoral College. While the Electoral College system was established by the founders with the aim of creating a localized, representative election, evidence shows that it no longer serves this purpose and often produces results at odds with the will of the people.

One of the main counterarguments to abandoning the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing only on a few highly populated areas. However, data shows that presidential campaigns are already overwhelmingly focused on a handful of swing states under the current system. According to national popular vote tracker websites, over 90% of campaign events and nearly all campaign ad spending in the 2020 election were concentrated in just six states. Such narrow targeting undermines the goal of encouraging geographically diverse support. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, small states would lose their influence. But according to United States Census data, 81% of Americans live in urban areas that are concentrated in just 16 states. Thus, the current system arguably favors rural voters over the urban majority. A national popular vote would give every American citizen an equal vote regardless of geographic location. It would better reflect the will of all Americans rather than depending on the outcome in a few swing states.

Most importantly, there have now been two presidential elections this century where the winner of the national popular vote did not win the Electoral College. This defies the fundamental principle of one person, one vote. As long as it remains possible for a candidate to lose the national vote but win in the arbitrary state-by-state Electoral College process, faith in our democratic system will continue to erode. For these reasons, I strongly believe we should transition to a national popular vote for electing the president.

Thank you for your consideration of this important issue. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1
"Most citizens do not realize that even though it may be easier and does not require a large amount of energy to operate, cars pollute the air that we breathe and it becomes tainted. Citizens may have their own personal reasons why they ride bicycles, walk or take the bus. If everyone takes part in not driving a car, the society would dramatically improve. For one the amount of tracffic would decrease. The text states congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog.... In other words this is saying that the fog was so intense that people driving were not able to operate their vehicles. Since no one was driving or on the road, traffic went down 60 percent due to the amount of smog. In addition to the amount of traffic being lowered, certain car lots would have an significant increase in business. Article two states exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. In other words car dealer ships their profits and their makings would sky rocket due to the increase of people purchasing this particular type of vehicles in an attempt to make the Earth greener.

Adding on to the fact that not only will car dealer ships that sell these types and models of cars profit increase drastically, the citizens will either have electric vehicles or they will have the type of vehicles that can occupy more than three passengers per trip or outing. So then the amount of exhaust coming from cars and going into the air will be reduced. Electric cars do not produce exhaust and if more people drove cars that can seat more than three people, then exhaust will still be going into the air but the amount would be less than it usually is. Not only will reducing car usuage prevent air pollution, it brings people together and helps them relax. Article three states it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. In other words this is saying that banning cars allowed the citizens to just relieve stress.",0
"The author of The Challenge of Exploring Venus suggests the opinion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Throughout the article, the author brings up many of those dangers but also many ways to prevent them and all the upsides to visiting the planet. The author supports the idea very well throuhout the article.

The author begins the article by stating all of the dangers of actually having a human visit or land on Venus. The article mentions that no spacecraft has survived more than a few hours because of such harsh conditions. Those harsh conditions begin with the temperature. On Earth it is rare to get much higher than 110 degrees Fahrenheit, but on Venus, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahreheit. Venus is closer than Earth to the sun, with an atmosphere made up of about 97 percent carbon dioxide and with clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The author also mentions to worsen the conditions, it is common to have erupting volcanoes, major earth quakes, and big lightning strikes across the planet. To put these conditions into perspective, the author mentions that even Earth's deepest submarines would be crushed when placed on Venus.

After the author mentions all the horrible dangers of studying and visiting Venus, all the good that would come from the trip is brought up. For example, the author mentions that the planet is the most like Earth and it would be incredibly helpful to NASA and the whole world to research Venus and actually send someone to visit the planet. The author also mentions that at certain times, Venus is the closest to Earth which would make for a shorter travel time than visiting another planet. The author also highlights that Venus very well could hvae supported forms of life many years ago.

Lastly, to prove the opinion of the article, the author brings up counter arguments to all of the current dangers many people have about sending someone to Venus. The temperature issue is solved along with the air pressure issue when the author suggests the idea that NASA has to possibly send a blimp-like spacecraft to float around Venus, just 30 miles up and off the surface. The author states that this would reduce te temperature to around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is actually phisically possible to live with, and a similar air pressure to the Earth's. Although this blimp idea will provide limited insight, a human could actually survive this trip.

In conclusion, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The article supports this by first giving a list of dangers, then giving reasons to go through with the idea, and lastly presenting a way to fix previous issues. The author knows what he is talking about, addresses each issue strongly and confidently, and supports his idea very successfully.",0
"Introduction:
As a scientist at NASA, I am here to address the topic of the Face on Mars. There are some who believe that this formation is a creation of extraterrestrial life, but I am here to argue that it is simply a natural landform. The evidence we have gathered supports this conclusion, and it is important that we look at all of the facts before jumping to conclusions.

Body:
The first argument in favor of the Face being a natural landform is that there is no concrete evidence to support the idea that it was created by aliens. The article Unmasking the Face on Mars points out that the formation appears to be a mesa with a flat top, and that there are many other similar formations on the Martian surface. If it were an intentional creation, we would expect to see more evidence of this in the surrounding area. However, there is nothing to indicate that this is the case, which leads us to believe it is simply a natural formation.

Secondly, the article notes that the Face appears to be symmetrical, which has led some to believe that it was created by intelligent beings. However, there are also many natural formations on Earth that are symmetrical, such as the pyramids in Egypt. The fact that a formation on Mars is symmetrical does not automatically mean it was created by aliens.

Finally, we have to consider the scientific evidence that suggests the Face was formed by natural erosion processes. According to the article, the formation is situated in an area that has been subject to weathering and erosion, which would account for its unique shape. This explanation is far more reasonable and likely than the idea that it was created by an advanced alien civilization.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, while it may be tempting to believe that the Face on Mars is the result of intelligent design, the evidence simply does not support this conclusion. There are many other natural formations on the Martian surface that are similar, and there is nothing to indicate that this formation was created by aliens. As scientists at NASA, we must always approach our research with an open mind and a willingness to accept new evidence. However, in this case, the evidence clearly supports the idea that the Face on Mars is simply a natural landform.",1
"The Importance of Seeking Multiple Opinions

Nobody is perfect; we are human, after all.

Advice is one of the many things that we as people rely on to make good decisions.

However, sometimes getting a second opinion just isn't enough to solve the problem.

Larger issues and bigger decisions require more than just one supporting opinion, and that's why many people get advice from a large group.

This can help to gather more information, helps get a broader view on the situation, and allows you to build an open mind.

Getting advice from several people allows for you to gather more information.

For instance, if you had to pick a high school to go to, then asking advice from several people could allow you to find out even more about the school.

Obviously you would have to get advice from people who happen to know about said subject, but finding people who have a lot of knowledge on a subject could be very helpful, as it would allow you to gain more knowledge on the topic.

In the long run, having more information will simply inform you more on your decisions.

While knowledge is important to making a decision, it's also important to play devil's advocate-essentially putting yourself in someone else's shoes.

It's very important to get opinions from both sides of the arguement.

For instance, say you are trying to decide if you'll vote for Donald Trump in November.

Try to get opinions from people who support Trump, people who don't support Trump, and people in the middle who might go either way.

This allows for you to have a broad knowledge of the subject, and see both the good and the bad-which will only help you make this big decision.

Listening to the opinions of both sides of the arguement, combined with deep knowledge of an issue/topic, will help to have an open mind.

Having an open mind is always important to making decisions, because it leaves you open to try new options, or explore new routes while doing something.

Being open to every opinion and genuinely listening is the best way to form your own opinion, and that is the key to making any important decision.

Having an open mind can help you in other ways, too-you could try out new things and discover something new that you enjoy, or you might find something that you deeply loathe.

Having tried out both things though, you can actually form a solid, original opinion on the subject,

That's all there is to it.

Advice from one person will only shape your opinion to be similar or just like their's; listening to several differing opinions, whether you disagree or not, is the only way you can truly build your opinion without it being a general clone of someone else's.

Listening leads to knowledge, knowledge leads to understanding, and understanding leads to an open mind.

In the end, advice from several people is an important part of life that we can credit with our success.

I believe the Electoral College should not be used in the United States anymore. To understand the faults within this system, one must understand the system at its basic level. The Electoral College is a system that consists of 538 electors. Each state has a different amount of electors, granted on the size of that state's population. When the election is held, the voter votes for the electors, not the candidate directly.

The first fault one can find while examining this system is the winner takes all policy that most states have. In paragraph seven of the first source, the article states, Most states have a winnertakesall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. This system seems unfair, especially in states where the vote for electors is won by a small margin. The votes cast for the candidate who lot the electoral votes in their state are not counted in choosing the president, which hinders the ideals of democracy in this country. In paragraph nine of the second source, the article reads, according to a gallop poll in 200, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College, won the popular vote but lost the presidency. This crisis in 2000, when George W. Bush won the electoral college, but Al Gore won the popular vote, displays the lack of clarity with this system. This election was a prime example that the president is not chosen by the popular voice, but rather by the Electoral College, which does not accurately represent everyone.

The second fault with Electoral College stems from the first issue: people are not voting because they feel as if their voice is not being heard. Stated as a counterargument in paragraph 23 of source three, the article states, It can be argued that the Electoral College method...may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. People are choosing not to vote because they feel as if their voice is being shadowed by the major political thinking in their state, and this mindset corrupts the institution of democracy in the United States.

An argument made by those in favor of the Electoral College can found in paragraph 20 of source three, Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign...They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and the most thoughtful voters shoule be the ones to decide the election. This argument is opinionated and has no substantial evidence behind it. According to source 2 in paragraph 13, During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. This was due to the candidates spending their time, money, and efforts to win over swing states, the states that could go either Republican or Democrat depending on the candidates that year.

The Electoral College is a system that should not be used anymore because it does not properly consider the opinions of all voters, turns away voters who believe they will not have their voices heard, and leave states without seeing ads or candidates during the election because these candidates are trying to win over other states.",0
"The impact of video games on child development is an often-overlooked and complex topic. Although they are believed to help children develop certain skills, there is much debate over what kinds of long-term effects they have. While some research has shown that video games can be beneficial for cognitive development and problem solving abilities, there are also potential drawbacks that parents should consider before letting their children play. Video games provide a unique way for children to interact with technology at an early age. Being able to engage in virtual worlds with realistic graphics and characters allows them to express creativity, explore different roles within the game, and practice strategic thinking as they progress through levels. In addition, playing video games can encourage social interaction between peers as well as foster positive relationships between parent and child when played together. This can enhance communication skills and build confidence in young people's ability to creatively solve problems outside of the home environment. Despite these benefits, it’s important to remember that spending too much time playing video games could lead to negative consequences such as neglecting school work or developing poor physical fitness habits due to being sedentary most of the day. Furthermore, studies show that excessive gaming may affect emotional regulation which could lead to feelings of frustration or distress if not properly managed by adults within the household setting boundaries on use time and content rated appropriate for each age group . Television programs related violent behavior associated with online gaming might increase aggressive thoughts among juveniles who lack self-regulation strategies when exposed repeatedly over extended period times . Excessive exposure may also cause sleep deprivation since individuals tend stay up late participating in competitions or driven by curiosity about new challenges making more difficult fall asleep naturally resulting in mood swings during daytime activities due poor rest periods affecting academic performance impacting decision making processes diminishing concentration capacity during lectures particularly noticeable upon exams . Despite all this evidence many argue that playing computer games teach valuable life lessons along other interactive activities such board sports where players learn how strategize devise specific plans approach tasks",1
"People often debate whether it is better to gain broad knowledge about many academic subjects or to specialize in one. My opinion is that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. I believe this because it offers more flexibility, allows for the development of a variety of skills, and encourages creativity.

Having broad knowledge of different academic subjects can offer more flexibility. For example, if someone has a broad knowledge base and wants to switch careers, they will have a better chance of doing so successfully. This is because they will have more skills and knowledge that they can apply to the new job. A specialist may have difficulty because their knowledge and skills will be specific to one area. Additionally, a person with a broad knowledge base may have a greater chance of getting a job they want, since they can demonstrate a vast range of skills and knowledge.

Having a broad knowledge of different subjects also allows for the development of a variety of skills. For example, a person who is knowledgeable in multiple subjects can learn new concepts quickly and easily. This is because they have a better understanding of how different things interact. Additionally, having knowledge in different areas can help someone think more critically, as they can draw on different perspectives to come up with unique solutions to problems.

Finally, having broad knowledge of different subjects can encourage creativity. Learning about different areas of knowledge can help someone uncover new ideas and develop their own unique insights. For example, a writer may draw on their knowledge of history and psychology to create compelling and original stories. Similarly, an artist may combine their knowledge of biology and art to create beautiful pieces of art.

In conclusion, I believe it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. This is because it offers more flexibility, allows for the development of a variety of skills, and encourages creativity. Therefore, I would encourage people to gain knowledge in different areas to help them experience more success and satisfaction in life.",1

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to continue its use in electing the President of the United States. While some argue for the abolition of the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote system, I believe that the current system provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. In the event of a dispute, it is less likely than in a popular vote system. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Although a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely. This level of certainty ensures that the will of the people is accurately reflected in the outcome of the election.

Another important benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must appeal to multiple regions in order to be successful. This is crucial for a candidate to be an effective president, as it prevents them from favoring one region over others. It ensures that every region's interests are considered and prevents any region from feeling disenfranchised.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes leads to candidates focusing their campaign efforts on swing states. This means that voters in these states receive the most attention and information from the candidates, making them the most thoughtful voters. It is important for these voters, who are likely to decide the election, to have a thorough understanding of the candidates' platforms and policies. This helps to ensure that the most informed voters have the greatest influence in choosing the president.

The Electoral College also provides balance to the political weight of each state, as it restores some weight to large states that would otherwise be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. The electoral votes awarded to each state are directly related to their population, which means that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This helps to ensure that the concerns and issues of both large and small states are addressed by candidates.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This can greatly simplify the presidential election process and avoids the potential complications that come with run-off elections. Instead, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, ensuring a smooth transition of power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides balance to the political weight of each state, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some may argue for a popular vote system, it is crucial to recognize the important benefits that the Electoral College offers. I believe that this system should be preserved in order to maintain an effective and fair method of electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my views into consideration and continue to support the Electoral College. 

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. Today, I write to you regarding the means of electing the President of the United States: the Electoral College. While the process has faced fierce criticism, I contend that it serves our nation well and should be preserved.

The Electoral College was crafted by our founding fathers as a compromise outlined in the Constitution (Office of the Federal Register), and this compromise is often overlooked in the fervor to shift towards a direct popular vote. The system may not proffer the impression of a modern democratic concept where every vote has the same weight; however, it is eminently practical in application. 

Judge Richard A. Posner elucidates five practical reasons for maintaining the Electoral College system. Each reason reflects the ingenious architecture of our nation's democratic process, expertly tailored to prevent potential chaos and disruption in our presidential elections. From the certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, to restoration of weight for big states and avoidance of run-off elections, the Electoral College serves to ensure that our Presidential elections run smoothly and that every state matters.

Surely, there can be unpredictable anomalies, as noted by Bradford Plumer, who cites examples from history where the popular vote winner did not win the presidency. There are instances of electors defying the will of the people or double submissions of electors. However, these instances have been rather infrequent, and safeguards are in place should they arise.

Plumer also argues that the Electoral College disincentivizes candidates from focusing their campaign efforts evenly across all states. While that can seem undemocratic, Posner points out that this incentivizes candidates to appeal broadly to multiple regions of the country. Furthermore, the system brings out the most thoughtful voters in the swing states, thereby ensuring that those who are vested in the political process play a crucial role in these elections. In addition, large-populated states still receive significant attention due to their potential electoral votes.

The Electoral College system ensures finality in our elections, preventing potentially contentious run-off situations that could reverberate with political turmoil. The popular vote system may seem like a more straightforward democratic process, but it lacks the fail-safes that the Electoral College provides, which our forefathers ingeniously crafted.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may seem antiquated; nevertheless, its relevance is timeless in protecting our democracy from the potential pitfalls of a strictly popular vote methodology. We need to uphold this process, educate our constituents about its value, and maintain the stability of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best Regards,

"Dear Senator, People have different opinions on the Electoral College. Some feel that it should be changed, and the president should be elected by popular vote. To explain what the Electoral College is, the Office of the Federal Register writes What is the Electoral College?.

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, to explain the problems with the Electoral College, and lastly, Richard A. Posner writes In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President to explain why we should keep the Electoral College. It has been made clear that we should not change the Electoral College.

It is true that the Electoral College may be confusing Plumer, but it has worked for all these years, thus we should just leave it the way it is.

To start, The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress, and it also considers the popular vote of qualified citizens Office of the Federal Register. The founding fathers wanted us to use this system. They knew it would succeed.

Next, Plumer writes, It's official: The electoral college is unfair... This is not true because the number of electorals each state gets is always decided by the number of members that state has in the House of Representatives, plus two for the senators Office of the Federal Register.

Additionally, Richard A. Posner says that There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree all are pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. He then goes on and says, A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. In the Electoral College system, their will always be a certainty of outcome. Plumer goes against that and writes, Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. This cannot happen. Posner also writes that The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. The north, for example, does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president Posner. The president is everyone's president.

Also, The Electoral College considers swing states and big states. Plumer writes At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. This is not true because of the idea of swing states and big states. Swing States, also known as tossup states, are the states that pretty much decide the election. They could go either way Posner. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senete decreed in the Constitution.  This means that the larger the state in population, not size, the more their overall vote weighs.

Lastly, by using the Electoral College, we are avoiding RunOff Elections. A run off election is when no candidate recieves a majority Posner.

In conclusion, you and I both know the Electoral College has some flaws, but overall, it makes sense to keep it the way it is.

Yours truly, Emily.",0
"The industrial revolution was a pivotal point in the history of our nation, and its impact is still felt today. This period of technological progress saw rapid advances in the production of goods and services all over Europe, ultimately resulting in profound alterations to everyday life. During this period, one particular industry that underwent transformation was cotton spinning. By replacing human labor with machines powered by coal or steam engines, this new technology enabled much faster production rates while also reducing costs. In England during the 18th century, most cotton spinning factories were located near areas where cheap coal could be obtained easily; many were even constructed close to rivers to take advantage of natural sources of water power for running machinery. The invention of Richard Arkwright's 'Water Frame' further increased efficiency as it allowed multiple spindles to run at once using only a single hand crank - which itself had been improved upon following James Hargreaves' introduction of his patented 'Spinning Jenny'. Beyond their improvements on productivity and cost-effectiveness however, these early machines also provided an opportunity for factory workers throughout Britain and beyond to increase their wages through higher piece rate payment systems - something which drastically altered society as it meant more people now had access to greater earning potential than before. This newfound economic freedom enabled many individuals who previously would not have had the chance otherwise gain access into the middle class or even eventually become wealthy themselves; indeed some entrepreneurs (such as Robert Owen) who made their fortune from cotton mills went on to establish philanthropic foundations aimed at improving living conditions for mill workers throughout Britain and abroad too!. . Whilst there certainly were drawbacks associated with such advances in technology - namely job displacement caused by automation and exploitation due excessive working hours among other things — overall it is clear that without innovations such as those pioneered during the industrial revolution world may look very different today; therefore we owe immense gratitude towards those who helped make possible what we now enjoy today through inventions & advancements made centuries ago!",1
"Think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. Which do i feel is more beneficial?

Well working alone get you more focus and not playing around. If working with a group it will be different then working alone, because you can work faster or get the answer of them and be a great group to past the class and work on it but working together as a group it will be hard not you not gonna focus too because they gonna be playing around and not pay attention to what the teacher is saying in class.

Some people wanna work alone or work as group and the reason why people want to do that because working long they can focus and not play around, and working as a group people are gonna work together just to play around and not be paying any attention just being in the phone or talking.

Teachers need to do something about working together as a group because they just gonna goof around and not do there work they just gonna be talking and being on their phone. I feel like people need to work alone so they can focus on there work and be paying attention to the teachers and do there work. I don't think people should work as a group. At the same time people should work as a group because they can help each other and give answer to each other",0
"When you ask multiple people for advice it is good because they want to help with the situation that you need hep with, they want you do what is best for you, and that person might not want you to get hurt because they might have been in that situation already.

First, when you ask people for advice they would like to help you out because they are your friend and they do not want to see their friend sad. So they want to help you out more and they want you to talk your problems out with them so they can know what is going on and what they are going to do. When a friend is helping you out they want to give you good advice so you do not have to worry and the situation again. When you ask multiple people for advice it is good because they want to help with the situation that you need hep with, they want you do what is best for you, and the person might not want you to get hurt because they might have been in that situation already.

Therefore, your friend want you to do what is best for you because you might be going through a situation and you do not wan nobody to know the situation that you are going through so they want to do what is best for you because they do not want to see you in a bad mood because and they do not wan to be mad at you because you gave them a bad advice and they do not know what to do after. Some people are scared to give their friends advice because their advice might be bad and they do not want you to do what is bad, and they do not wan you to feel bad because you did that person wrong or you did some mean to them and they just feel embarrassed because of what you said to them and how you made them feel.

However, that person that is giving you advice do not want you to get hurt so they would want you to follow your heart and do what is best for you to do and what makes you happy. Whatever comes to your mind and it makes you feel happy you should do whatever makes you happy because you do not always have to listen to your friends advice cause they can always be wrong and they might want you to do something bad and make you fall in a wrong path. That person did not want you to get hurt because they might have been in that situation and that person that been hurt because had some one them advice so they went along with it and they did not get hurt after all.

For example, say my friend is in a situation and she wanted to let someone down easily so she asked for advice I would say she should follow her heart and do was is best for her because say if one of her friends gave her advice and it was not so good she would feel bad and not want to get advice from that person any more. But if i was going through a situation and it was bad I would rather keep it to myself and follow my heart and not ask people for advice because it might be bad and it would be to much for and it it could to people stressing a little to much or feel embarrassed about the situation.

In conclusion, this prompt is trying to say like you should hear some of peoples advice because he would lead you to a good or a bad path because it dependents on the situation and what you are going through if you are going through something and its bad i recommend you to keep it to your self and not let others give through your head because it might lead you to a bad path because some people want to others get hurt and not do so good while they are doing their best to get out of trouble. People want to help you with situations because you will always need a friend to help you with important things or certain things you do not want to tell others so you tell that certain friend and that person helps you so you do not always have to be alone and go through situations on your own.",0
"Volcanoes are a powerful and destructive force of nature, but also incredible to witness. Volcanoes are caused by the intense heat within the Earth's mantle, which is pushed up towards the surface due to an increase in pressure, resulting in molten rock erupting. Such violent eruptions can have a devastating effect on people and the environment, with lava flows consuming homes, structures and in some cases entire villages. Volcanoes are typically composed of an outer shell of solid material that has been explosively ejected around the opening, followed by the inner layers of rock and lava. 

Despite these dangers, a volcano can be an enjoyable educational activity to explore and appreciate their raw power. With the right preparation and guidance from volcanologists and other experts, visitors can explore the inside of a volcano safely and discover fascinating geological features such as steaming vents and volcanic caves. By understanding the power of volcanoes and marveling at the beauty of their geological formations, we gain insight into the workings of the Earth and our place in it.",1
"An often overlooked issue that affects the health of people in our communities is air pollution. It has been linked to an increase in respiratory illnesses, and can have long-term effects on both physical and mental health. Air pollution exists due to a variety of factors, including vehicle emissions, burning trash or wood for fuel, industrial processes, and agricultural practices like intensive crop production and open burning. These pollutants can cause harm when breathed in at high levels over extended periods of time. Those living in cities are especially vulnerable to the adverse impacts of air pollution as they experience higher concentrations than those found in rural areas. For example, studies show that outdoor air quality is worse near roads with traffic congestion due to increased emissions from vehicles. In addition to this direct risk posed by smog-filled cityscapes, there is also evidence linking these polluted environments with mental health problems such as depression and anxiety; one study showed a link between exposure to diesel exhaust fumes during pregnancy and increased odds for developing ADHD later on in life for the child. Aside from individuals being impacted directly by poor air quality conditions, entire communities suffer economic losses because of it - businesses lose customers who cannot spend time outdoors due their medical conditions worsened by polluted air; healthcare costs rise substantially due not only treatment but also preventative measures needed; productivity decreases when workers need more days off work due to illness caused by bad air quality leading employers having difficulty making up lost revenue . Therefore reducing airborne toxins needs prioritization if we want sustainable growth within our society while protecting its well-being simultaneously. And while it may seem difficult given how pervasive sources of pollution are today (e.g., factories still actively emitting smoke into residential neighborhoods), there are steps we all can take right away – starting with simply addressing both public policy makers responsible for regulating emissions standards as well engaging industry leaders on green technologies available or possible implementation initiatives– which will create positive change sooner rather than later if taken seriously enough now. .

First it give the percent on people and all they feel. They just have to do the math and look at all the muscles in there body. Then they will put it in the six different feelings. Then add it all up and which every one is the highest is what that person is feeling.

Second it will make sure we are not thinking wrong about someone who looks like thet are feeling something when really its something else. It will give you an ad for how you are feeling and mak you watch it,but if you start to feel something else then it will give you a different ad to watch. It will give you a lesson how what you are feeling so you wont get board.

Last reason is it will give you steps to help you. step one it might tell you to lift the corners of your mouth. Second it will tell you to crow's-feel around your eyes. It will know if you are lieing and it will wait till you are telling the truth about it. It knows how important feelings can be so it wants the right one.

"Some schools use cellphones in the classrooms for educational purposes. Allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom may have a positive effect in the education of the students, who use their cellphones frequently. In other words, it will make students feel better about doing their classwork. Because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and students will learn better.

One positive effect of allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom is that students will have a chance to finish their classwork or homework. Some students have classes that left many homework, so that means that they may need more time to finish their assignments. Moreover some students have personal issues, for example; Sometimes I can not focus in do my homework because I may have a problem that blind my mind and that makes me feel stressful, and that does not let me work on it. Also some students have jobs after school, for example. I have a job after school and sometimes my tiredness is huge that it does not let me finish my homework, and I can tell that it is really difficult, so having this experience I think that it would be really good that school allow students use their cellphones in the classrooms to educational purposes.

Another reason is that students will have the chance to check their grades or assignments. Some students miss school and they probably does not if have assignments, or they does not have time to check it in home. Most of the students forget easily that they have homework, for example; Sometimes when I get home and I started doing some of my labors and when I notified it is already time to sleep, so they next day I do not have any time to finish it. Therefor it will be good to most of the students check what they are missing during class, and they can probably ask the teacher for permission if they can work on what they are missing. Also ask for help to the teacher if they does not know how to do it, for example; I had a friend that math is hard for him, so he check his assignments in the classroom and ask the teacher for help to understand better, so I think it will help students to get their grades better.

Some people say that the allow of using cellphones can cause a negative effect is because it will distract students, for example; some teachers say that students will be doing something else, like texting or playing video games, in other words students will not pay attention in class. Whatever they are incorrect because students will a better way to learn, in which one they will feel comfortable. The point is make feel that they can learn in an interesting way, for example; Some teachers let students play trivia games on their cellphones, so students can learn and have a good time doing it. They will learn better because most of the things that students look in their phones they are capable to memorize it. May be the pass generations think that the use of too much technology, like allow the use of cellphones in the classrooms is a bad idea because it will make our brains slow is not true it just help us to learn in a better way.

In conclusion, the school allowing the use of cellphones in the classroom will have a positive effect because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and they will learn better. We are the new generation and the future of the next one, we have the help of technology to get a better knowledge. The future is on our hands and make it easy is our decision. They are just finding better ways for us to learn and educate better because they want us to succeed in school, like in our lives.",0
"Advertising is an effective tool used to promote products and services, and it is often used to make products seem better than they actually are. While this technique can be beneficial, it can also be misleading and cause people to make uninformed decisions. I disagree with the idea that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, as this is not always the case.

To begin with, not all advertisements are created equal. Some are designed to be informative, while others are designed to be persuasive. Informative advertisements are intended to provide consumers with facts about a product or service, such as it's features and benefits, so that they can make an informed decision. On the other hand, persuasive advertisements are designed to influence consumers’ opinions and encourage them to purchase the product. In this case, the product may be portrayed in a more favorable light than it is in reality.

In addition, some companies are more ethical than others when it comes to advertising. Companies that abide by ethical advertising practices strive to be as honest and transparent as possible. They make sure that the information they present is accurate and that they do not make false or exaggerated claims about their products. This ensures that consumers are not misled and that they can make an informed decision.

Furthermore, some companies take extra steps to ensure that their advertisements are accurate and truthful. For example, they may have their products tested by independent third-party organizations to ensure that they meet certain standards. They may also conduct market research to gain insights into consumer preferences and needs. This helps them to create advertisements that are more accurate and truthful.

Finally, many companies are becoming more mindful of their advertising practices. They are increasingly using techniques such as “truth in advertising” to ensure that their advertisements are honest and accurate. This includes providing information about the product or service in a clear and concise manner, as well as avoiding any misleading or exaggerated claims.

In conclusion, while some advertisements may make products seem much better than they really are, this is not always the case. Companies that abide by ethical advertising practices and take extra steps to ensure that their advertisements are accurate and truthful can help to ensure that consumers are not misled.",1
"In the world we live today, almost everyone owns a car; or even two. The amount of people  in the streets going to work and to school is excessive. This is a real issue that is almost not discussed. There are cities in the U.S. that have more cars than there are people in the city, like in L.A., which is something excessive. It would be good to not use cars once in a while. That's why, some countries are doing an event every year where they don't use cars all day. And they'd have to pay a fine of 25$ if they violated the rules.

We have been using cars for a long period of time, and we will keep using them for much more, but it would really help if we did not use them as much. Because sometimes there is so much traffic, is better to walk. When you own a car, you get stressed out. We all hate those Bad Drivers and we get angry when they are stopping us or blocking our way, and that gives us stress. Sometimes you relay so much on your car that you even use it to go around the corner, and this does not help your economy at all.

Driving so much isn't helping the environment either. A lot of european cities have smog due to the pollution of so much cars, so they were forced to ban all cars that had odd-numbered plates from driving. If less people were to drive, there would be much less pollution. I don't think it would hurt anyone to walk once in a while.",0

"As an opinion i think that the Electoral College should not be able to elect the president. I think it should be a coice of the people. (In source 1) paragraph 6 when you go to vote you actually are voting to pick the electors when you vote for the president each state has electors so you help pick the electors. When people vote they are voting for presidents not the electoral college its not right to have a electoral college. Because it should be the peoples choice.

(In source 2) Even presidents want to get rid of the electoral college that is saying something. People would rather have a direct election then the kind we have now and I agree. See when the people are voting for electors they dont know what that elector is going to vote for they can only hope for what he is going to vote for. (source 2) Paragraph 13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. I agree with this source it is what my opinion is, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. i think that the electoral college should be abolished. Who knows maybe some of the presidents woukd have been different because the electoral college could have changed some peoples votes. Say some wanted Obama not to be president but the state elector picked him that could be a game changer. It is suppose to be a democracy the people make the choices this is not a dictatorship.

What if the state all voted for one president then the electoral college voted for the other that would throw off everything. There would probably be riots to be honest. This is making our country sound like a dictatorship. We the people of the United States of America deserve to pick our leaders. But say if you were part of the electoral college you would like this situation. So put yourself in their shoes would you like it or not. Of course you would you hold the power of picking the president. Its honestly probably the most stressful job in the world.

See if we had a vote to see if we should have to electoral college i think alot of people would vote no. I dont see why we cant have this vote as a country then there wouldnt be a topic to argue about. The electoral college is a decision that was not in the constitution i believe so it can be removed very easily. My opinion is that we take the electoral college out because it is causing nothing but arguing. We deserve to pick if we want to have a president we want or not. We deserve this power atleast, we dont have any power as regular people we deserve this. They shouldnt have the right to take this away from us.",0
"One example of an inspiring individual who has used failure as a way to become successful is the entrepreneur Steve Jobs. Jobs was famously fired from Apple, the company he founded, in 1985. In 1996 he returned to Apple with a renewed sense of ambition and drive, and made the decisions which turned the company around and made it the international success it is today. Jobs himself stated that being fired from his own company forced him to push himself and think differently than before, stating Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me... The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.” Jobs' experience with failure ultimately inspired him to become even more successful, thus demonstrating the beneficial effects that failure can have in inspiring people to become successful.",1
"One day I needed advice on how to stay calm during a test, so I asked multiple people including my mom, my dad, and my teachers. Getting multiple opinions helped me a lot during that test. Therefore, I believe that getting multiple opinions when you're asking for advice can help you make a better choice because you will get different points of view, you could get tons of ideas from asking multiple people, and different people can help you with different questions.

Firstly, I think that if you ask multiple people for advice, then you will get different points of view. In addition, people tend to make the best choices from talking to multiple people and getting lots of advice from them. Also, people think very differently so you can get fantastic advice from one person and terrible advice from another person. The people in your life want to see you succeed so they will give you advice to make the best choice possible.

Additionally, I believe that you can get tons of great ideas from asking multiple people for advice. The people in my life have given me amazing ideas when I asked for advice. Those ideas have led me to make the best choice possible for the situation. For example, I asked everybody in my family how to get better at sports and each one of them gave me a great idea and I improved significantly. Also, if you have lots of ideas then you can make a smarter choice than if you only had one idea.

Lastly, different people can help you with different questions. For example, I asked my mom and dad how to be less stressed in school. My mom told me exactly what to do and my dad didn't know what to say, so if I only asked my dad then it wouldn't have helped me much. Therefore, multiple people can give you different advice.

In conclusion, people make the best decisions when they ask multiple people for advice because you can get different points of view, you can get tons of ideas, and different people can help you with different questions. Furthermore, Everyone can make the best choice when they ask multiple people for advice because everybody thinks differently and different people can give outstanding advice.",0

Student's will benefit from take the school classes at home instead of going to the school because they could work at their own pace. Student's dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Student's come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Student's take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. This way if student's are really sick and can't come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the student's keep on track with the class. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. A other reasons this is good is that student's that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Student's would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. It would be easy the get help if the student's dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help.

This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning. It will save a lot of time for the student's and teacher's because they wouldn't have to be there the whole day at school. It will make more people like school because you can take it online and you can finsh it at any hour but its due that day.,0
"The history of the game Monopoly has been widely discussed and debated, with many people questioning its longevity and staying power. While it started as a more serious economic simulation intended to illustrate the negative effects of monopolies on society, it quickly became something much larger and beloved by generations over the years. Monopoly was first invented in 1903 by an American woman named Elizabeth Magie Phillips when she patented her Landlord's Game. Around 1904-1905, several other variations were developed from her original version until Charles Darrow created his own version which he called Monopoly in 1934. This is the version that would eventually become popular around the world due to Parker Brothers purchasing it from him for $7,000 in 1935. Throughout World War II and into modern day society, Monopoly has been a mainstay among families during times when finances may be tight or entertainment options are limited. It continues to captivate players with its theme of buying property while competing against their friends or family members for ultimate domination on the board. There have even been various special edition versions released throughout time such as Disney versions based off classic films like The Lion King and Marvel Superheroes editions celebrating some of our favorite superheroes!. . What has kept Monopoly alive these past 100+ years are not only its creative themes but also how easy it is to learn yet difficult to master - making each round new yet challenging depending on who you're playing against! With numerous strategies out there ranging from rushing properties early before anyone else can buy them all up to banking heavily so that no one goes bankrupt at any point; what remains true is that this timeless classic will be here for many more years ahead - with plenty more exciting iterations just waiting around corner!",1
"The accomplishments of Mahatma Gandhi, Bill Gates, and Nelson Mandela all demonstrate that hard work and dedication can lead to success. Mahatma Gandhi fought for India's independence through peaceful protests and civil disobedience, which eventually resulted in India's independence in 1947. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard University to form Microsoft, growing it into the largest software company in the world. Nelson Mandela successfully campaigned to end the apartheid system and introduce democracy in South Africa. 

Thomas Jefferson's quote I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it speaks to the idea that hard work can lead to success. This has been exemplified by these individuals, and is evidence that setting goals and working diligently to achieve them can lead to a successful outcome.",1
"For many years now people have been cutting down on the usage of their cars. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like you become happier, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. many different outcomes come from limiting the amount of time you use your car.

In many countries around the world people have reduced the amount of time they use their cars and the outcome has been phenomenal. Heidrun Walter was asked about how she felt about taking cars out of her life, she answered When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, Rosenthal par3. Cars have been liked stress and when cars were taken out of Carlos Arturo plazas life he said It's a good opportunity to take away stress... Selsky par24. When cars were taken out of their lifes they felt happier and stress free.

In these last few centuries we have polluted the world more than anyone else has. This is due our technological advances. One of the biggest advance in these centuries is the motor vehicle. The car has now become a household item. Cars are one of the main reasons why our ozone layer is open and we responsible for 50 percent...of greenhouse gases emissions Roseenthal par5. It's shocking to see how far we have advanced but to see how much we have destroyed in the world at the same time is crazy. Paris has become so poluted that they had to get a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city Duffer par10. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after fivedays intensifying smog Duffer par14. Imagine what would happen if cars were reduced in use for a month.

For many people in these countries they have gotten many benefits back. The government has always used 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport Rosenthal par9. Its shocking how much money goes to bulding roads and not things for the development of our communities. The people in Bogota,Colombia have cut back on their use of their cars anf the money the government usually uses for cars or gas is now going to other things. Parks and sports centers also have boomed throughout the city.Selsky par28. many of the uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramaticly cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up Selsky par28. When the goverment did not have to pay for highways or streets they used that money for parks or smooth sidewalks.

Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like people become happierand stress free, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. If everyone cuts back on the time they use their cars the world would be healthier, the population would be heathier and happier, in addition the government would use money for more important things. Reducing the use of cars is step one in the world becoming healthy again.",0
"Technology has made a vast impact on people's lives in the past several decades. Despite popular opinion, this impact is overwhelmingly positive, leading to improved quality of life and unprecedented opportunities for societal advancement. 

Experts have found that technology can help people improve their productivity, as well as their motivation. For example, studies conducted by Stanford researcher Clifford Nass have shown that technology can improve people’s ability to focus on tasks, allowing them to accomplish more in less time. Additionally, texting has been found to improve people’s mental well-being by facilitating daily communication with friends and family.

Further evidence suggests technology can help people establish greater autonomy and express themselves creatively. For instance, smartphone applications provide tools for people to document and express their daily lives, from simple journals to video production. Additionally, studies have found that technology can help people break down barriers and connect more easily with individuals from diverse backgrounds, allowing for greater global awareness and understanding.

Overall, technology has been a hugely positive influence on people’s quality of life. By allowing us to prioritize our focus, stay connected with loved ones, and explore creative avenues, technology is a powerful force that should be embraced, rather than feared.",1
"Do you make your own decisions or do you seek guidance from experts ? I believe that people should be able make their own decisions. I believe this because people are not away right about things and what they say. Another reason would be because only yourself know what chooses you want to make in life and so those are your decisions. My third reasons why I would say that people should be able to make their own decisions is because you shouldnt follow what others do. You always see people making good or bad chooses or making not good decisions but does that mean you got to do what others do, no because you have to make those chooses on your own.

My decision for people to make their own decisions would be because trusting others on what they say isnt always the right things. Would you want your best friend making a decisions for you ? Maybe not because you never know if she/he could be right or telling a lie. People in life are not always right about things ,you dont want to get in trouble for doing something dumb or that isn't the right thing for you to do . If you make a good decision on something at school or basically anywhere you can show others on how to make good chooses so they wouldn't make mistakes . This why you shouldn't listen to people making decisions for you this is because they can cause problem and get you in a situation where you dont want to be put in.

In life theirs so many things you can do but it all up to you . You decide what you want to do, you shouldn't let other people judge you in your decisions because they shouldnt get in involved . This is because everyone does what they want to do in life . If you make a bad decision thats all on you because you made the decision not someone else you can't blame others for that when it comes to you getting involved in a situation that you got yourself put in. I know your children in school might've gotten in trouble with something and if not it because they are great children who don't follow what others do. There are ton of students in school who make bad decisions and this because they like to do what others do by following what others do and seeing others do bad chooses. In that case that is not right because it makes them get in trouble and they lose time of education for making bad decision.

When it comes to making your decisions you make your chooses. Only you know what chooses you want to make. If you do don't want to do something you should't do it . Don't be afraid to not do something because you think it a bad decisions just first before everything think about what your doing. You should always question yourself is it a good choose or not because your the one making your own chooses. Everyone is their self you shouldn't be controlled by anyone. When it came to me making new friends at school I choose wisely with who I would want to be friends with because I didn't want me to be influenced by making bad chooses by others. No one has the right to choose to do things for others when it comes to making chooses it all depends on yourself.

In conclusion just always remember that you should always pick your decisions and not others for you. I know in the world we live in we all know that not everyone makes good chooses which is okay in some cases. This just means that not everyone is perfect which is true because their is at least one thing in life that you made a bad decision on. People just need time to think about what chooses or decisions they want to make so that after they make the chooses or decisions they don't think about it twice and why they should've made a wisely decision. Don't let yourself down or stress about what's rights for you in life.",0
"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Driving

In today's world, cell phones have become an integral part of many people's daily lives. However, using a cell phone while driving can distract the driver and endanger lives on the road. For this reason, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any way when operating a vehicle.

There are several reasons why cell phone use behind the wheel is dangerous. Firstly, cell phones require both mental and manual attention from the user. Answering a call, checking messages or apps, dialling a number - all of these activities require the driver to take their eyes off the road for periods of time. Data shows that drivers who use cell phones have slower reaction times and are less aware of their surroundings while driving. This puts not only the driver at risk, but also other motorists, pedestrians and cyclists sharing the road. 

Furthermore, studies have found that driving while distracted by a cell phone is equivalent to, or even worse than, drunk driving in terms of impaired ability. Answering or making a call requires the brain to switch attention betweentwo competing tasks - concentrating on driving while also engaging in a phone conversation. This cognitive distraction significantly reduces the driver's ability to focus fully on critical driving functions like steering, changing lanes and responding to hazards.

While hands-free options seem safer, research also shows that the cognitive distraction of a phone conversation impairs driving just as much as manual interaction with a device. Drivers engaged in phone conversations show reduced awareness, slower reaction times and difficulty multi-tasking. Additionally, studies have shown that hands-free calling does not lessen the crash risk associated with distracted driving.

In conclusion, the dangers of distracted driving are clearly evident, and cell phone use has been identified as a major cause of impaired and inattentive driving. To save lives and prevent serious and fatal accidents on the roads, drivers should not be permitted to use any aspect of their cell phones, whether through hands-free or handheld methods, while operating a moving vehicle. Public safety should be the top priority in setting laws regulating cell phone usage by drivers. A total ban is the only effective way to curtail this significant threat and reduce accidents caused by distracted driving.",1
"The popularization of virtual reality technology in recent years has been an exciting development, particularly as it relates to the gaming community. Virtual reality (VR) offers gamers a truly immersive experience like no other before it, allowing them to be transported into new and faraway lands with photorealistic visuals and ultra-realistic sound systems. This rapidly evolving field promises endless possibilities for game developers who can now explore greater depths within their creations than ever before. VR has really revolutionized how people play video games by providing them with a realistic three-dimensional environment that allows for unparalleled immersion. For example, VR headsets allow players to have complete control over their movements and view every angle around them in real time - something completely impossible just a few short years ago. Additionally, many game designers are taking advantage of the advancements made in haptic feedback technology, which provides physical sensations such as vibration or pressure on different parts of the body when playing certain games. This helps create an even more engrossing atmosphere that pulls players further into the gaming world. In addition to enhancing the overall gaming experience for players around the globe, use cases for virtual reality stretch much farther beyond entertainment. Military personnel are using VR simulations to hone their combat skills without putting themselves at risk during live fire exercises; medical professionals engage in simulated surgical operations using lifelike mannequins; architects look through 3D renderings of buildings they created on computers; and even language teachers utilize virtual classrooms designed with speaking lessons tailored specifically towards each student’s needs– all from the safety of home or work!. . The future looks bright for virtual reality technology as its potential usage grows exponentially across multiple industries each day. As this platform continues to evolve over time more features will become available and even more incredible uses will surely arise – so whether you're looking forward to exploring fantastical worlds or solving complex problems within your own profession there's no telling where VR might take us next!",1

"Phones and Driving

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. Several researchers have proved that using cell phones during driving makes driver more exposed to fatal accidents. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle phone and vehicle at one time. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. As already discussed, cell phones distract drivers' attention resulting in comparatively slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events. Studies have shown the fact that breaking reaction time is also slower while talking on a cell phone during driving. The perception, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on a cell phone during driving. Especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to these areas increasing risks of fatal accidents. Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor.

During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic",0
"The consequences of a failure to educate are expensive in both financial and human terms. In financial terms, a lack of education can lead to increased unemployment, poverty, and inequality. In human terms, a lack of education can prevent people from finding and maintaining employment, earning a living, and accessing basic services.

Some of the most damaging consequences of a lack of education are economic. In an increasingly globalized world, a lack of education can lead to a disadvantage in the job market. In addition, a lack of education can impede people’s ability to find and keep a job, which can lead to increased poverty and inequality.

In addition to economic consequences, a lack of education can have a wide range of other negative consequences. These consequences can include reduced access to basic services, reduced opportunity, and increased social isolation.

A lack of education can have a significant impact on individuals and communities alike. In general, a lack of education leads to reduced access to social and economic opportunities. This can lead to increased social isolation and a decrease in the quality of life for individuals and communities.

In conclusion, a lack of education has a wide range of negative consequences, both economic and social. These consequences are often both costly and destructive. As a result, it is important to invest in education in order to ensure that all individuals and communities have the opportunity to improve their lives.",1
"Dear dumb Republican , The Electoral College is stupid and we should not use it. I have many reasons to believe that this is an unfair system that is adulterating our country's wonderful ways.

The first reason for why I despise this system is because we have had people with more than half of the country voting for them not be elected President. This is due to winning by just enough in certain states that you get their elector votes. If you win by 51% in a state with 4 electoral votes, but someone else wins by 99% in a state with 3 electoral votes, you will have more electoral votes, but less popular votes. In the system that we are set up with, electoral votes is how you will get elected for President. This happened during the presidential Election in 2000, when Gore won the popular vote, but Busch won the electoral votes and was elected President. It also happened several times before, most recently in 1888.

With the Electoral College it is more likely that a tie will happen. This is beacuse there are only 538 electoral votes, which is a lot less than 300 million popular votes, for every U.S. citizen. If there is a tie, then the Senate and House of Representatives has to do all this stupid stuff to figure out who wins.

In the process of the Electoral College, the voters in the smaller states are given more power than those in the larger states. Every state gets a minimum of 3 electoral votes, and then more are added depending on the size of the state's population. WIth 3 votes for a population of 500,000, Wyoming has more votes per citizen than the larger states do. Large states with ten of millions of people may have only a few more votes than Wyoming does, giving it's individual citizens more power in choosing the President.

Because of the Electoral College, Presidential candidates spend a large portion of their time in Swing States, like Ohio or Florida, and little or no time to states with predictable outcomes. A swing state is a state that could go either way in the election, so the candidates spend a lot of time convincing it's populants to vote for them, because of the winnertakesall method. This is unfair to the states with predicted outcomes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is old, useless, irrational, and hurtful to our country. This is why we should abolish it.",0
"It is better to ask more people for advice than to just ask one person, because someone can hear more points of view, it leads to more discussion, and the person with a problem can think about a decision or problem more. When asking for advice, it is usually to solve a problem. If someone only gets one perspective on a problem and then makes a decision, it is a quick decision to what could be a more important problem. When multiple people are asked for advice, they will have different ways on how they see a particular problem. This is good because it helps look at a situation in more than one way, and make a decision that makes the most sense. When multiple people are asked, there is more of a discussion about a problem, which can help think of more ideas.

One of the reasons asking more people for advice is the best way to go, is that someone can hear all of the different ways people look at a situation. This is good for the person who is asking advice, because the person can look at the problem in all different ways, and see which solution best fits their personal needs and goals. This is better because what makes sense to one person, might not make sense to another person. As they say, nobody knows someone better than them self, which applies to someones problems. Hearing different points of views will also allow someone to see which point of view is the most popular opinion, and they can make their decision based off of what most people agree on.

Another reason why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking only one person, is that it leads to more discussion. When there is a situation that needs a solution, the best way to find a solution is through discussion. When only one person is asked for advice, there will only be one discussion, and there will be only one point of view. When multiple people are asked, the person asking for advice will have a lot more discussion about the problem they're facing. When asking multiple people for advice, the person asking could also bring up previously heard points of view and see what everyone else thinks of that opinion. Once the person asking hears many opinions, and opinions on others' opinions, the discussion created will help them think more about the problem, and ultimately find the right decision.

The final reason why someone should ask multiple people for advice, is because it causes somebody to think about a situation for longer. If only one person is asked for advice, then there will be only one time where it is discussed. When multiple people are asked for advice, it will take up a longer amount of time, and will most likely be at different times and days. This is good because people can change their minds very quickly, and what someone thinks of their situation one day, might not be what they think of it the next day. When more people are asked for advice, all of the time it takes to ask them can be used to deliberate and decide which decision may be the best. When asking one person for advice, someone may only think of a solution to a problem over the course of one day. When asking multiple people, it could require someone to think of a solution for multiple days. This will make sure they think of all possible decisions and outcomes, so they don't make a spontaneous decision.

When asking for advice, it is better to ask multiple people than to just ask one person. This is because asking more than one person leads to hearing more points of view, having more discussion about a problem, and thinking about a problem for longer. Asking one person for advice will limit a decision and it may lead to someone making a bad decision. Asking multiple people for advice can lead somebody to become more open minded about a problem, or even life in general. For these many reasons, asking multiple people for advice is the best way to find a solution to a problem or situation.",0
"Nowadays, work is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. The main reason is the pressure of modern society. People are under more pressure to succeed, and they have less time to relax.

In the past, work was mostly physical. People worked with their hands, and they didn’t have to think too much. Nowadays, work is mostly mental. People have to think all the time, and they don’t have much time to rest.

Another reason why work is more stressful nowadays is that there is more competition. In the past, people didn’t have to compete with others. They could just do their work and they would be fine. Nowadays, people have to compete with others all the time. They have to be the best, and they have to work harder than ever before.

The last reason why work is more stressful nowadays is that there is more pressure to succeed. In the past, people could just do their work and they would be fine. Nowadays, people have to be successful. They have to make a lot of money, and they have to have a good job.

All of these reasons make work more stressful and less leisurely than in the past.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable living has led to a growing trend of limiting car usage in many parts of the world. This shift away from car-centered suburban life has numerous advantages, some of which are highlighted in the passages provided.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe and up to 50% in some areas of the United States. By reducing car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or biking, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In the passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban, it is evident that the reduction in car usage resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. Smog, which is a common problem in many cities, is exacerbated by car emissions. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for all residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The German suburb of Vauban is mentioned as an example of a car-free district where residents have access to public transportation and amenities within walking or biking distance. This shift in city planning not only reduces the need for extensive road networks and parking spaces but also promotes a sense of community and encourages physical activity.

In addition to the environmental and urban planning benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on our personal well-being. Many residents of Vauban expressed their newfound happiness and reduced stress levels after giving up their cars. The reliance on cars can often lead to traffic congestion, road rage, and the constant rush to get from one place to another. By embracing alternative modes of transportation, individuals can enjoy a slower pace of life and connect more with their surroundings.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage, as highlighted in the passages provided, are clear. It not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality but also creates more compact and accessible communities, fosters a sense of community and well-being, and promotes a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of living. As we strive to create a greener and healthier future, limiting car usage is an integral part of the solution.",1
"When making an important choice, do people ever wonder if they should have asked more than that one person? Do they ever wonder if that one kid they asked had a biased opinion or if people in general have different opinions? When making a big, important choice, people, especially young adults and teens, should seek more than one person's opinion. People could have different past experience with lots of things and might help people decide when making an important choice. People should seek more than one opinion when making an important choice because people can have different past experience, people can be biased, and people can have different opinions about the subject matter.

When making an important decision, lets say adopting a dog. People would want to ask multiple people if this would be a good idea or not. Adopting a dog is a big choice in someone's life and the person should seriously think this through. For example, lets say the person asks somebody who, in the past, had a dog who would always use the restroom in their house. That person probably would not recommend getting a dog. But then, if you ask a little kid who loves their dog very much and cuddles with it daily, they would recommend a dog. Now what if this individual had only asked the person with the bad dog? This person would now be denied their life time companion and emotional support. This exemplifies why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice. Now what if somebody wants to travel the world and they ask somebody about it. One person hated traveling, they were sick,got a bunch of stuff stolen from them,and got lost. This person hated traveling and would not recommend it to the person wanting to travel. This person had a bad past experience. But what if the person asked another person about traveling. This person absolutely loved traveling. They loved everything from the unique culture, to the flying in airplanes, to trying new things. This person had a good past experience with traveling and would recommend it to the person wanting to travel the world. This is another example of why getting multiple opinions before doing something because they could have different past experience. People with different past experience will have different opinions on certain matters.

People have biased opinions about certain matters. Imagine if a person is trying to open a farm, but the person's best friend hates all farmers. The best friend has a biased opinion towards farmers and hates all of them. When the person asks the best friend if they should start a farm, naturally the best friend will say no. But if the person asks someone who loves animals and the outdoors, that person would say they should open a farm. If the person had only asked the biased best friend who hates farms, they would now not have a job and place to live that they are happy with. This is one example of why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice because people have biased opinions. What if a girl wants to try out for a football team. All of her friends say that is gross and annoying because girls can not play football. This is a biased opinion about girls who play football. While all of the girl's teachers and family say that is a great idea and the change the school needs. If she would not have asked her teachers, she wouldn't be on the team. That is why you should ask multiple people before making an important choice like starting a farm or joining the football team.

People feel differently about lots of different things, whether they are small issues like shoes being ugly, or big issues like political opinions and whether schools should have dress code. What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club. This is why people should get multiple opinions before they do something because people have different opinions about things.

When people ask for advice, they should always seek more than one opinion because the people they ask could have different past experience, be biased, or have different opinions about the matter. When asking for an opinion in something, always ask different people and different kinds of people. People can have different opinions about things and be biased. Asking biased people for an opinion on something is never good so that is why people ask more than one individual before they make an important choice. In conclusion, this is why people need to get multiple opinions before they make a big choice.",0
"Online classes from home provide students with an abundance of benefits.  To be successful in taking one, students need to be focused and have high concentration levels. These classes offer students a chance to develop new skills and knowledge quickly and efficiently. An added perk of taking classes online is that students may also have the opportunity to have free time for other activities. Additionally, taking tests remotely can help students save time and energy by not having to travel to and from testing locations. All these factors make taking an online class from home an appealing option.",1
"Dear Florida State Senator, The Electoral College needs to be disbanded. There are many reasons why the Electoral college needs to be stopped, but I will go over that later. How is it fair to Americans, if you say we have a vote that counts when we are just voting for a slate of people that might vote for someone we do not want. The voting process needs to be handled by the people, and who we want to run this country that we live in.

The voting process is just not fair to Americans. It's in the constitution that we have a right to vote and that we have the right to choose our president, but you people in the electoral college take away that right when we only get to vote for a slate of people. If elections were done by popular vote things might have been different in many ways. First off, in the 2000 election if it was done by popular vote, Bush would not have won and we would have had, Al Gore as president. The electoral college is just completely fair to voters. Because, in some states they have a winnertakeall system, so the presidential candidates to spend time in those states to get their vote. Seventeen States did not see the presidential candidates at all in 2000 campaign, so what is the point in having voting in those states if we dont know who we are voting for and why we are voting for them? There is not a reason to vote when the electoral college votes fore us.

Yes, sometimes people do not know what they are voting for and why, but that is because we have no say, it is not up to the people who is going to the president of the country of we live, because the electoral college will not let us choose who we want. Many people, very important people, such as Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and the U.S Chamber of commerce have agreed that we should abolish the Electoral College and give the people the vote and see who wins president then. If the people had a vote on who is president it would be very simpler, than the Electoral College when they have a tie, we would not have to bounce the decision, we could randomly choose one state and let them vote to see who the president is for 4 years. Yes, some may agrue that randomly choosing one state would somehow turn out to but a massive mistake, but there is a way to make sure that no state gets selected 2 times before the first time of any other state.

Many my agrue that, the Electoral college is there for our benefit. Tell me one benefit there is to having no vote as regular citizen. I get it that there are more people in some states than others, but that does not mean we all get the same number of electoral votes as the huge states such as, California, Florida, and Texas. So if we are not going to have the same votes number of votes no matter what why does it matter if we give the people the option and have them vote for who they want, it is because the Electoral College does not care who we want they choose the president on who they want. Also, if it is up to the Electoral College then why does it matter if the citizens vote, I mean of course we want to give our input of who we want, but it does not matter, because our state senators will go behind our back and vote for someone we do not want.

America, of course, has many more freedoms than other countries and we are not taking advantage of that, because we can not allow the people to vote for the President of the United States. The citizens do not want to vote for a slate of people, they want to vote for our president.",0
"Teenage is a part of life where everyone wants to be cool. Most teenagers are not mature at this specific point of age. They think if they will not follow rules they will look cool. Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart.

The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues.

Curfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning. If you are not healthy it will effect your studies. A person health should be a first priority. Most teenagers are not mature enough curfew will keep them healthy. There was a day when I was out with my friends on shopping. We went to mall together. I went back at home at 12:30 pm, than in morning I went to school. I did the same routine for a week. After that I started getting sick. It effected my brain. I went to doctor they said it happened because of lack of sleep. After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger. The more you will get good sleep the better your health will be.

Curfew will keep teenagers smart. Most of teenagers like to study at night unless they get distracted by extra stuff. Teenagers go school in the morning some of them do extracurricular activities. They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They don't do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had D in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent.

There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.",0

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College for Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College for presidential elections. While I acknowledge that there are some valid concerns and criticisms of the Electoral College system, I believe that it plays a crucial role in our democracy and should be retained.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, and a candidate needs a majority of 270 electoral votes to be elected President. This system ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election and prevents larger states from dominating the process.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. In a country as diverse as ours, with different regions and varying interests, it is crucial to have a system that requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College ensures that no single region can elect a President on its own, encouraging candidates to develop broad-based platforms and appeal to a wide range of voters.

Moreover, the winner-take-all method used by most states encourages candidates to campaign in swing states and pay attention to the concerns of voters in those states. This allows for a more focused and substantive campaign, as candidates are motivated to address the specific issues facing these swing states. It also ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who tend to pay closer attention to the campaign, have a greater say in deciding the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power held by large states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as outlined in the Constitution, gives smaller states an equal representation. The Electoral College allows larger states to regain some of their weight, as the number of electoral votes is determined by a state's population. This ensures that presidential candidates cannot ignore the concerns and interests of voters in large states, even if they may have a more concentrated campaign strategy in swing states.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process and lead to prolonged uncertainty. By producing a clear winner, it maintains the stability and efficiency of our elections, ensuring a smooth transition of power.

While there are certainly criticisms of the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system and the potential for faithless electors, these issues can be addressed with reforms that preserve the overall framework. For example, implementing proportional representation in all states would distribute elector votes more accurately and address concerns about the winner-take-all system.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in ensuring that our presidential elections are fair, representative, and balanced. It guarantees a trans-regional appeal for candidates, incentivizes campaigns to focus on swing states, balances the power of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While reforms may be necessary, the underlying system should be preserved for the sake of our democracy.

Thank you for considering my perspective. I hope that you will continue to support the Electoral College and work towards reforms that improve its functionality.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The new technology to read human facial expressions might be a little too much. It might say your emotion is one but your not feeling that emotion and then it will just throw you off. But if we could use it just for pictures, and projects in schools, that might be a bit more intresting.

Say if we got this new technology in our schools today it might not always be correct then throw some students off, or it could become very distracting and take away from the students learning. Todays kids are so involve with technology and it shouldn't really be mixed in with our schools as much because students just become distracted A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrcutor.  What if the coomputer reads the wrong emotion that the student is feeling and then it wouldn't give them the correct lesson. But if we used it for school related projects then that might help with the students learning and engage them more.

In conclusion it wouldn't be the best solution to use this technology to read students emotions, becaue it might not always work, and students can become distracted easily. But if we could use it for projects or to do research then that might be a way that students can use it for studies.",0
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College system for choosing the President of the United States. While some argue that it is outdated and unfair, I believe that the Electoral College serves an important purpose and should be maintained.

Firstly, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President by a popular vote of citizens. This system ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process by allotting electoral votes based on their representation in Congress. If we were to switch to a popular vote system, candidates would primarily focus on densely populated areas, leaving the concerns and interests of rural areas and smaller states largely ignored.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in elections. While a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes means that even a very slight majority in a state leads to a landslide victory in electoral votes. This reduces the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, which could potentially result in a deadlock or the need for a run-off election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Candidates must focus on winning in multiple states and regions, rather than just targeting the most populous areas of the country. This ensures that the President has broad-based support and is accountable to a diverse range of constituents. In a popular vote system, candidates could effectively ignore large portions of the country and cater only to the interests of certain regions.

The Electoral College also gives weight to the political balance of large states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may seem unfair, the Electoral College offsets this by giving more attention and influence to larger states in presidential campaigns. This helps to prevent candidates from solely focusing on small, swing states and ensures that the concerns of both smaller and larger states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This reduces the complexity and potential for prolonged election processes, allowing for a clear winner to be determined.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College system, such as its potential to disenfranchise voters in non-competitive states, it is important to consider the benefits and practical reasons for retaining it. The Electoral College ensures that each state has a voice in the election process, promotes regional appeal in candidates, encourages campaigns to focus on a diverse range of states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College system should be kept in place for electing the President of the United States. It provides a fair and balanced approach to representation and ensures that the interests of all states and regions are taken into account. While improvements can be made to the system, a complete abandonment of the Electoral College would not be in the best interest of our country.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By implementing strategies to reduce dependence on cars, such as car-free zones and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create safer, healthier, and more sustainable communities.

One of the primary benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to research cited in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing reliance on cars, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution highlights how car emissions contribute to smog and poor air quality in cities. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for citizens.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on public health. As mentioned in the passage about Vauban, Germany, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. This is because relying on cars can often lead to traffic congestion, long commutes, and increased stress levels. By creating car-free zones and promoting alternative transportation options, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall well-being of citizens.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can foster more connected and vibrant communities. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, describes how millions of residents hiked, biked, or took buses to work during a car-free day, resulting in streets devoid of traffic jams. This not only promotes alternative transportation but also creates opportunities for people to interact with each other, leading to stronger social connections and a sense of community.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to economic benefits. The passage about the United States decreasing car ownership and driving miles suggests that it may have a long-term cultural shift with implications for the car industry. While this shift may have negative effects on car manufacturers, it can result in positive economic changes in other areas. For example, as more people rely on alternative modes of transportation, there may be increased demand for public transit systems, bike-sharing programs, and other related industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting public health, fostering connected communities, and potentially bringing economic benefits, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is essential that we prioritize implementing strategies to limit car usage and promote alternative transportation options for the benefit of all.",1
"In this passage the author supports his/ her idea by explaining that there are so many risks that will be taken if you land on Venus unprepared. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by saying, A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent cardon dioxide blankets Venus, which means that Venus is covered in a dangerous acid that basically covers the whole entire planet.

In the text i chose this quote because it explains one of the many dangers to going to the planet Venus ans why it is very dangerous and risky because lives could be on the line.

"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This change is being driven by the realization that cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and are contributing to climate change. By reducing car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, we can not only reduce our carbon footprint but also improve our quality of life.

One example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. In this upscale suburb, residents are not allowed to park their cars on the streets or in their driveways. Instead, they have to park in large garages on the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of the families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of them actually sold their cars to move there. Vauban is an example of how suburban life can be separated from auto use, and it is part of a larger movement called smart planning. This movement aims to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking.

The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous. First and foremost, doing so helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and slow down the progression of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a major issue, partial driving bans have been implemented to reduce air pollution. During these bans, only cars with specific license plate numbers are allowed on the road, while others face fines for driving. These measures have been effective in reducing congestion and improving air quality. By implementing similar measures in other cities, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for our citizens.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to a more active and healthier population. In Bogota, Colombia, the city has implemented a car-free day, where cars are banned from the streets and alternative forms of transportation are encouraged. This event has been successful in promoting biking, walking, and public transportation, and has helped to reduce traffic jams and increase physical activity levels among citizens. By limiting car usage, we can create cities that are more walkable and bike-friendly, leading to healthier and happier communities.

In addition to these advantages, limiting car usage also has economic benefits. By reducing the reliance on cars, we can invest in and improve public transportation systems. This can make commuting more efficient and affordable for everyone. It can also help to reduce traffic congestion, which is a major issue in many urban areas. By investing in public transportation and creating more compact and walkable communities, we can improve the overall quality of life for our citizens.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing our reliance on cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote physical activity, and create more efficient and sustainable communities. It is clear that limiting car usage is a crucial step in combating climate change and creating a better future for ourselves and future generations.",1
"In the passage the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports this idea because it shows us the positive side as well as the negative side. For example a positive thing is Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. It is also the closest in distance too. Despite all the dangers Venus has the author wants us to examine and study the benefits and the challenges Venus has for all of us.

Here in Earth we are used to the atmospheric pressure and the amount of carbon dioxide we encounter on earth. The quote On the planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees fahreinheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

shows us how a negative thing is that those conditions are way more extreme than what us humans contribute to on earth. Meaning that we would not survive in Venus in those conditions. Another thing is that Venus has a way more hotter surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. This shows us how even though mercury is closet to the sun, even venus has a hotter temperature which to us that is dangerous. More over high pressure and heat, the venus weather presents additional inpediments such as erupting volcanoes,strong earthquakes,and most likely lightning strikes.

Scientists are discussing further visits to Venus. As well as astronomers think that there might have been a possibility that in venus it may well once have been the planet that has been more earth-like planet in our solar system. The quote Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth. shows us how Venus one day could have became a planet just like earth and have life. Which is a positive thing because today venus still has some features that are similar to those on earth. Some of those characteristics that venus has similar to earth are valleys,mountains,and craters. In the future this could be a recall that venus can one day be a safe option for a planetary visit,space travel,and maybe one day it can have life.

The NASA has an idea for sending humans to study venus but could that really be a safe plan? There plan to the rare conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above. The quote At thirty-plus miles above the surface,temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahreinheit,but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. shows us how those would not be easy conditions for humans to travel and be survivable too. This is a risk that humans have but scientists are telling us to look at them as challenges and not risks. Which could be a negative thing.

In conclusion the author explains the negatives and positives that Venus has for us in the future and today. There can be risks but if they find a way for us to be safe, everything will be okay. Human curiosity will lead us into many new adventures in the future. Our travels on earth and beyond shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts, but lead us into the safest way possible.",0
"Venus, somtimes called the 'Evening Star,' is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. Venus is one of the planets close to earth. Venus is a plant that most often has the same weather as the Earth. The geology and weather present like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning that strikes on the surface. The author of this passage, The Challenge of Exploring Venus, suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Venus is a good place to study. Many astronomers were fascinated by Venus of how it may once have been the most Earth-like in our planet solar system. In the passage the author states that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could of had formed any various forms of life. Also at this time Venus still has some features of earth. Some of the features Venus has is that the surface are rocky sediment, they also include valleys, mountains,and craters.

Another point for how Venus is a good planet to discover. Some impressive things that could happen on Venus are exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. by comparison, systemsthat use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat,and other forces. Also modern computers are powerful, flexable, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

At the end Venus is our sister planet. NASA has been working and planning other ways to aproach Venus. Most of their electronics had been tested and had lasted for at least three weeks. As the author has stated in the beginning that studying Venus is a wothy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Worth the dangers that could happen at Venus there are other impressing things to find and discover.",0
"In many ways, driving is a great resource. But with this great resource, comes flaws. When cars burn gas made of fossil fuels, it causes many environmental disadvantages. Limiting the usage of cars could be good for the people who live on this planet everyone in many ways.

To start, one reason why limiting the usage of cars would be an advantage for our society is the reduction of smog. Smog is caused by the smoke and fog of car exhaust and it is very harming to the environment as well as to humans. In Paris, in 2014, driving was banned because of smog. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro 31 dollar fine. The same would apply to oddnumbered plated the following day. Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog This quote from the source shows that because Paris is such a huge and global city, the amount of cars needed to have the city function in the way society has been making it function for the past years has created serious pollution. This crazy amount of pollution created smog in Paris. In fact, according to the article, The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog This type of pollution is know for causing certain kinds of cancer in people, and is what is thought to be the reason for the Ozone hole above antarctica. Not to mention it makes the day gloomy and not as bright because of the trapped smoke and pollution. In Vauban, Germany, the streets are completely carfree' Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars A resident from this suburb said 'When I had a car I was Always tense. I'm much happier this way.' Heidrun Walter says this as an example of how it is less stressful to walk places and hear the sounds of nature rather than feel the responsibility and worry that comes with driving her children place to place.

Another reason why it is more advantageous to limit the usage of cars is that it makes people be forced to start working on healthy habits walking, riding bikes as well as keeps pollution levels down with car pooling and other different means of travel. Bogota, Colombia In a program that's set to spears to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams Source 3: Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota This car free day program in Bogota is a good example of how people choose healthier ways to get around the city. Skating hiking and biking are all great ways to get around the city to work because they cause the person commuting by these methods to exersise. Also, if some peopkle so choose to take the bus, they are still helping to make the city, and world, more healthy by reducing the amount of pollution. There are also trends within the youth of the United States that shows a decrease in wanting to drive. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 1639yearolds getting a license... Source 4: The End of Car Culture This shows a distinct drop in the number of new aged drivers getting their license. Most teenagers these days don'r see the big deal in driving as was seen when it was a new phenominon. He Mr. Sivak and I have similar observations about our children. Mine 19 and 21 have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. This was stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal Source 4: The End of Car Culture Rosenthal isn't the only parent to see a decline in the interest to drive from their kids. Many people have arguments with their children everyday trying to get them to drive, but there is far less of an interest from teenagers anymore. Most young people see a car as just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesnt work. Source 4: The End of Car Culture With this disinterest, there could be a large decrease in the pollution given off by cars, and cause a much healthier future for Earth and the people who inhabit it.

In conclusion, by limiting the usage of cars we would be given several advantages. Of these advantages are a healthier life style, and the reduction of pollution and smog. Both of these would lead to a happier and healthier Earth for humans, and the future of human kind to exist and live on.",0
"Dear Florida Senator, The ongoing debate of whether or not the Electoral College process is fair or unjust is always around you, I presume. I would like to give some personal feedback in the matters of this situation.

I understand that the Electoral College was created in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Source 1 However it is not a fair or even equal compromise. The people hardly have any political voice in this aspect. The electors that in return vote for the people generally aren't chosen by the people, the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. Some state laws vary Source 1 If you faithfully are going to vote for the Presidential candidate of your choice, you should be able to have faith in your vote. Those in favor of the Electoral College could make the remark that Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...Source 3 In the world of reality people don't just want make a comment and expect no reaction, people want to be heard. This is similar to voting, people want their vote to count toward the candidate of their choice not the electors for the candidate.

This then runs into the problem of unfaithful electors. Their votes are never for sure. Although they claim to have trust that is rarely betrayed Source 3 you can never be a hundred percent sure in the electors. Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please... Source 2 If this happens the popular vote actually wouldn't go to the thought candidate.

Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Source 2 In a case of a tie the vote would go to the House of Representatives. This means that each state would only be able to cast one vote. This is not a smart backup plan. It is not fair for states of different population sizes to have one vote basically being categorized as one. Proportionally it is not right for a state who represents 500,000 such as Wyoming to recieve the same number of equally weighted votes as a state who represents 35 million such as California. Source 2 The Electoral College also follows the Winnertakeall method. This means that most in most elections the focus is on the swing states or toss up states, all the efforts go to these states. Even though the voters are most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election, as said by those who believe in the Electoral College Source 3 what about the voters who have been faithful all along? How can you expect them to feel when they barely get noticed? Those are the ones the candidates should be thanking and having gratitute toward because they are the ones who will be supporting them and their campaign.

I know that politics are filled with misconceptions and many confusing roles and aspects but please consider my thoughts and words. I speak for the voiceless and my fellow neighbors, but most importantly I speak for what our government was founded upon, WE THE PEOPLE.",0
"I favor in to changing election by popular vote because it would be more fair to the people who are running and it would be quicker to decide who is president.

I think its better to be elected by popular votes because people actually like the person for a reason and actually listening to what that person is saying and actually agrees what he saying and they see something in that person instead of just having congress vote count mostly instead of the citizens.

And its not really fair that a person wins just because of his or hers own group of electors gets him to win it should just be based on popularity because its fair as i said before for example what if their was some person running for president and he was not really good to run the United States and yeah some people voted for him but he wasnt as popular but he won the election because of his group itb wouldnt really be fair because  the people perferd the other guy better in office. Why because ethier people liked what he had for the states n what he would offer to the people and actually help us live good and thats what is important for the state its all about the people wants because thats how we will live right.

Also the person running for office might not have any electorial votes because theie campaigning wasnt heavy in a certain part of the state so they would oviously vote for the other person because they really havent seen what that person has to offer to them and he will have less succes in winning the election.

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate witch means that they can relie on  their state as much so they really wouldnt pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by a popular vote but of course no voters vote swings a national election.

And thats why I favor in popularity votes because its more fair for the canidates and its a better system in electing a president.",0
"Due to the growing popularity of computer games, many parents and teachers have become concerned about their possible effects on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development. I believe that, on balance, the positive effects of computer games outweigh the negative effects.

One of the most positive effects of computer games is that they help children to develop strong problem-solving skills. For example, many adventure games require players to think their way through complex puzzles in order to progress to the next level. In addition, strategy games such as chess and Go help children to develop planning and foresight. These skills are not only useful in the virtual world, but also in the real world.

Another positive effect of computer games is that they can help children to develop social skills. For example, many online games require players to cooperate with each other in order to achieve a common goal. This can help children to learn the importance of teamwork and communication. In addition, computer games can also help children to make friends. For example, many children who are shy or have social anxiety disorders have made friends through online gaming communities.

The negative effects of computer games are often exaggerated. For example, it is often claimed that computer games are addictive and that they can lead to violence. However, there is no evidence to support these claims. In fact, a recent study found that computer games can actually help to reduce anxiety and stress.

In conclusion, I believe that the positive effects of computer games outweigh the negative effects.",1
"Traffic in the city of Chicago is a significant issue that can have a large impact on its citizens. Every day, thousands of people rely on their vehicles to get around town, and when traffic jams occur, it not only results in major delays for daily commuters but also has negative environmental implications. The vast majority of these congestion issues come from too many cars on the road during peak hours or accidents causing blockages along heavily trafficked routes. To address this problem, local authorities need to take steps to reduce traffic levels during rush hour by promoting public transit or other forms of transportation such as biking or walking where feasible. Other solutions may include expanding roads or increasing carpooling incentives so that fewer drivers are taking up space on already congested streets. Additionally, updating infrastructure with better signs and signals can help ease bottlenecks caused by confused motorists who don’t know which direction they should be heading in order to avoid getting stuck in a jam. The effects of traffic go beyond just lost time for drivers; air pollution caused by idling cars is detrimental to everyone’s health and well-being and contributes greatly to global warming due to exhaust emissions from automobiles burning fuel unnecessarily while stuck behind the wheel for extended periods at a standstill. To counteract this harmful effect, cities must implement measures designed specifically with pollution reduction in mind – such as encouraging electric vehicle use over gas guzzlers – if they want their residents’ environments (and waistlines)to remain healthy. Citizens who live within city limits could also do their part by avoiding unnecessary trips into downtown areas unless absolutely necessary during rush hour times - especially since parking spots there tend to fill up quickly - and planning out alternate routes when possible so that they won’t become victims of gridlock themselves! Overall, making small changes like these can help reduce traffic levels significantly while ensuring that those living within Chicago still enjoy all the benefits it provides without having their lives negatively impacted",1
"If we think about it, this software is actually a big help for the schools and such. If we see our friend is in a bad mood then we can talk to them or find out why. I think this system can actually really help us but not only us but our teachers as well. The system digs deep into our muscles and will understand our whole face. It will indicate actions, emotions and feelings so that could help our friends if they are wondering why we are in a happy mood or a bad mood.

Our friends are really helpful at times so if our friend is feeling down or is happy about something we should have the right to know. According to Dr. Huang the software can tell us many things about a persons mood or what they are really feeling like. Knowing if a person is down or happy we can talk to them and ask what is going on, why are you sad or why are you so happy. By the computer telling us how a person is feeling will be so valubale because it shows us how big our technology is getting and by us knowing that we know there is going to something bigger than that later on in the future so now all we would do is wait for something bigger.

This software would be very helpful fot our own teachers because they could take us to the computer get our face to the computer and indicate if we aare bored or not. If she does this while she is teaching lesson and finds out we are confused then she can change her ways in teaching that lesson so we can actually understand it and if the teacher knows we are in a happy mood then she knows we understand the material or atleast thats why we are happy.

The Facial Acting Coding System would be a really good thing for us so we ned to get it attachted to our school software. All together it would help our friends and teachers. Espically the teachers because they would know what to do to teach us better so would understand the material that they want us to learn and the system would be a genuine thing. Not only would this help with teaching and understanding but for our friends that have depression, we would know when there emotions are hurting or when they are in a hurting place and we could help them by this software being a thing. People with depression never show it and we understand that but we could atleast do something about that and that is helping them and being there for them.",0
"Cars are part of our daily routines, they have been around for so long that we can't even remember when they first showed up, but did you know that people are starting to use other means for transportation?. Studies have shown that the number of miles driven in the united states has dropped steadily ever sice 2005, and as of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the the peak.

Part of the reason lies in the recession, americans with a low income can't afford to buy new cars; not mentioning the unemployed, and now that recovery is under way, the next few years will be telling if the decrease will stop, or continue. But looking at the bright side, if the pattern persists (and many believe it will) it will be beneficial towards carbon emissions and the enviroment, without considering the fact that car transportstion is one of the largest source of america's emitions.

America isn't the only country that has seen a major decrease in car transportation, other places have taken steps to decrease the use of cars. For example, in VAUBAN, Germany, the residents of this community have given up their cars, thats right!, Vauban's are completely car-free. Owning a cars is allowed, but they vanly be parked in two places, garages that can be purchased for $40,000, and of course, a home. As a result, seventy percent of the popullation does not own a car.

But why are they doing this?. Well, automobiles are used widely all around the globe, and that id a huge impediment to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Cars are responsable for 12 percent of green house emissions in Europe... and up 50 percent in some car-intesive area in the United States, that's why some places are triying to stop using vehicles, the advantage of not using cars relies on the fact that cars are dangerous to our planet, and we have to take care of our planet.

Finally(and most importantly)France and Colombia are taking major steps to fight the over-use of cars. Sice Paris has more smog than any other European capital, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numberd plates the following day, as a result congestion was down 60 percent  in Paris after 5 days. And in Bogota, Colombia, there has been a car-free day for over three years now in an attempt to promote alternative transportation, peole who refuse not use their cars are fined with a $25 dollar fine, because of this, the turnout has been large. And it has led to the construction oh 118 miles of bicycle paths.

So.... do you still want to use car?... or a bicycle?.",0
"The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens. Paragraph 1 The electoral college is made of 538 people called electors, these people are there to take in consideration what the people voted and then they them selves vote physically for the President of the United States. The electoral college is good because there is not as much controversy and if its been fine for this long it would not be changed now.

controversy, a big word with lots of meaning, but what does it really mean in this context. It is when two or more things are being argued about, in this case two political veiws. Whether or not we should keep the electoral college or get rid of it and go back to popular vote for electing the President of the United States. Having a little bit of controversy is good but the reason why the founding fathers made this into the constitution is to stop the out rages arguing that was going on when electing the First president. It states in paragraph 3 ,The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This shows that they didnt just make it to please one side of the argument, this pleased both side because it was very fare and didnt favor one side to the other. By doing this it nearly ended all of the arguing and controversy, which that is what they wanted to accomplish.

furthermore, the electoral college is good because why would you change something that has been working perfectly and helped the voting process out tremdously over hundreds of years. They have had voting for the President down to a science now, for example,The presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. paragraph 6 Everyone in the U.S. knows this date, it is imprinted in our brain when that day is and we need to clear our calenders and turn on the grill because that is a very specail day of change for our beautiful country.

Many people say there are problems with the electoral college, then again there are problems with everything in this crazy world we live in. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. paragraph 11 Yes there was a crisis but to say that the electoral college is corupt and bad just cause of that fiasco is to far. America is too strong to break down from just that and there are to many belivers in the electoral college to have it just fall to peices from that one problem. It also shows the resliency of the electoral college, and not just that but also showing changes so that those crisises wont ever happen again. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors... That is living proof that there are changes and fixes being made to further the effiency of the Electoral College.

All in all the electoral college has proven itself to be more then just helpful but it has changed America itself. It was made to settle a compromise made but it has settled more arguments then anyone can count. Its proven to the world it is here to stay and is not leaving anytime soon.",0
"In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and how he was saying different things about how Venus is and was shows that he really does have an interest in studying Venus and he defends his argument well because he goes into detail on what he wants to do and what he wants to know.

Although the passage is having to do with exploring Venus theres nothing much said about them doing things because they failed multiple times and by the looks of it I don't think its going to happen because of how the author talks about Venus.

The author seems to be doing everything he could to actually try to explore Venus despite the difficulties they are having, that even if it is dangerous the author will still try to do something about it.

In my opinion I think what the author's doing is very dangerous because he doesn't know what the outcome is going to be, it could go both good and bad because there is a possibility that anything can happen, as said in the article though, they are only looking at sending technology to try to explore Venus not humans so it wouldn't be as dangerous and I think thats why the author is still open on exploring it and not giving up so he can try to find some answers to what hes been questioning.

In the last paragraph (8) the author states that the challenge presented by Venus has value because of human curiosity because it will lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors and just basically saying to think of it as an imagination but at the same time something you can do and want to achieve.

In conclusion if the author thinks that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit then that's what hes going to go for, some people are also curious on that and so the author trying to do that will be helpful to others and himself and if he does succeed others will be satisfied with what the author came up with besides the dangers the study presents I do think that it will all be worth it at the end of the day, because that's a goal they've been trying to accomplish for sometime now.",0
"Cars have become a part of our modern day culture since the invention of the first model. Many countries around the world have an abundance of car buyers and users, however others are taking into consideration alternatives. The advantages of limiting car usage include relief from stress of cars upon individuals and reduced emissions in the environment.

Cars put forth a lot of stressful trouble upon users. These vehicles are designed to transport a person or people from point A to point B, however cars are for personal use that can cost an immense amount of money. When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter about her new carfree lifestyle Rosenthal,3. This ideology is spreading throughout all Europe as more alternate transportation are provided by the government. As Selsky mentioned in Source 3, locations, such as parks and sports centers with uneven sidewalks, have been replaced with broad, smooth ones for citizen's use. Moreover, many cities have provided a bicycle program to promote less usage of cars. These steps towards change help convince people that there are alternatives out there, and that we aren't limited to just buying a car and license to go to places.

Additionally, the limitation of car usage help establish a better and healthier environment for everyone. Cars emulate lots of dangerous gases that may harm our precious earth, many of which are responsible for the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect causes gases to be trapped in the atmosphere which harms our ozone layer and creates a smoglike appearance on our cities. Paris is an example of a polluted city as civilians battle against threatening smog from emissions of diesel cars in France Duffer,8. Many actions towards progressive behavior have increased the likelihood of limited car usage, such as tolls throughout cities and fines up to 25 for violators of laws. These enforcements will ensure that the environment is capable of maintaining generation after generation at a stable pace.

To conclude, many countries are pondering choices of opportunities to promote less usage of cars, while some are on their way to solve these issues, limitations on car usage have a variety of advantages for ourselves and the environment. These limits help reduce stressful situations, as well as provide a healthier ecosystem to live and prosper.",0
"As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but I can present both sides of the argument. Computer games have become an essential part of children's lives. They provide entertainment, enhance cognitive skills, and improve decision-making abilities. However, some people argue that computer games have more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development. In my opinion, the benefits of computer games outweigh the negative effects, and effective measures should be taken to ensure children's safe and responsible gaming.

Firstly, computer games can improve children's cognitive skills. They require players to use their problem-solving abilities, strategic thinking, and decision-making skills. For instance, puzzle games like Tetris can enhance spatial reasoning and visual perception. Role-playing games like Minecraft can improve creativity and collaboration skills. Therefore, computer games can be a valuable educational tool that promotes learning and development.

Secondly, computer games provide entertainment and relaxation for children. After a long day at school or during holidays, children can play games to unwind and relieve stress. Moreover, computer games can be a social activity that promotes bonding and friendship. Children can play games with their peers, siblings, or parents, which enhances their social skills and communication abilities.

However, some people argue that computer games have negative effects on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development. For instance, excessive gaming can lead to obesity, poor eyesight, and back pain. Moreover, violent games can promote aggression and desensitization to violence. Finally, addiction to gaming can lead to poor academic performance, social isolation, and mental health issues.

Therefore, it is essential to take effective measures to ensure children's safe and responsible gaming. Parents should set limits on the amount of time children spend playing games and monitor the content of the games. Moreover, schools and educators can incorporate educational games into the curriculum to promote learning and development. Finally, game developers should create games that are age-appropriate, non-violent, and promote positive values.

In conclusion, computer games have both positive and negative effects on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development. However, the benefits of computer games outweigh the negative effects. Therefore, effective measures should be taken to ensure children's safe and responsible gaming.",1
"Instant communication systems, such as text messaging and social media, have become increasingly popular in recent years. While these systems can certainly be useful in staying in touch with friends and family, there is some concern that they can lead to hasty opinions and quick replies rather than more thoughtful, well-reasoned points of view. In this essay, I will explain why I disagree with this idea.

First of all, the fact that instant communication systems make it easier to quickly send a message does not necessarily mean that people are forming hasty opinions and giving quick replies. People are still capable of taking the time to think through their words and make sure their point of view is expressed in a thoughtful and well-reasoned manner. In addition, some people actually prefer to take the time to think before responding. For example, some people may take a few moments to compose a thoughtful response and make sure that their message is crystal clear before hitting the “send” button.

Second, there are numerous tools available in instant communication systems that can help people form more thoughtful opinions. For instance, many social media platforms have features that allow users to post their thoughts and opinions and then receive feedback from others. This can be a great way to get different perspectives on a particular topic and can help users form more well-rounded opinions. Additionally, some instant communication systems allow users to share links to articles and other resources that can help them gain a more informed perspective on a particular topic.

Finally, some instant communication systems encourage thoughtful dialogue and discussion. For example, many social media platforms have discussion groups or forums that allow users to communicate with each other and have meaningful conversations about important topics. This allows users to exchange ideas and form more informed opinions on a variety of topics.

In conclusion, while instant communication systems certainly make it easier to quickly send a message, I disagree with the idea that they encourage people to form hasty opinions and give quick replies. In fact, many instant communication systems actually have features that can help people form more thoughtful opinions and engage in meaningful conversations.",1
"As an AI language model, I do not have a personal opinion, but I can provide a well-structured essay on the topic of how children's socialization affects society's destiny.

Undoubtedly, children's socialization plays a substantial role in shaping a society's future. After all, these children will become the future lawmakers, entrepreneurs, and leaders of the world. However, despite the significance of socialization, society has not learned how to raise children who can help bring about a better world. In my opinion, I agree with this statement, and I will provide examples and reasons to support this claim.

Firstly, a significant portion of children's socialization happens at home with their families. Unfortunately, not all families promote good values and behaviors that benefit society. For instance, some parents may instill racist or sexist beliefs in their children, which can lead to discrimination and bias against certain groups of people. Additionally, some parents may not prioritize education, which can lead to their children lacking the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute positively to society. Therefore, if families do not provide a good foundation for socialization, it can be challenging for children to become assets to society.

Secondly, the educational system plays a crucial role in children's socialization. However, many education systems do not teach children essential skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. Instead, the focus is placed on traditional subjects like math and science. While these subjects are essential, they do not teach children how to be empathetic, compassionate, or how to work collaboratively with others. Therefore, the current educational system may not be equipping children with the necessary tools to create a better society.

Thirdly, society's media influences children's socialization by shaping their values, beliefs, and behaviors. Unfortunately, much of today's media promotes violence, materialism, and superficial beauty standards, which can lead to desensitization and a lack of empathy. Moreover, the media often portrays certain groups of people negatively, which can lead to prejudice and stereotypes. Therefore, if society does not hold the media accountable for promoting positive values and messages, children's socialization can be negatively impacted.

Lastly, children's socialization can be influenced by their peers. Unfortunately, peer pressure can lead children to engage in negative behaviors like bullying, drug use, and other harmful activities. If children do not have positive role models or guidance from adults, they may be more susceptible to peer pressure, which can lead to detrimental consequences.

In conclusion, children's socialization plays a crucial role in shaping society's destiny. However, society has not yet learned how to raise children who can help bring about a better world. Factors like family, education, media, and peers can all negatively impact children's socialization. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize socialization and provide children with the necessary skills, values, and behaviors to contribute positively to society. By doing so, we can create a better future for generations to come.",1
"Technology has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. From smartphones to laptops to social media platforms, technology has made our lives easier and more efficient, but it has also brought about some negative impacts that we cannot ignore. In my opinion, technology is a necessary but not always a positive force in modern life. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my stance.

To begin with, technology has transformed the world into a global village by facilitating communication and breaking down barriers of distance and time. Thanks to technological advancements like emails, video conferencing, and instant messaging, people can now communicate with each other in real-time, irrespective of their geographic locations. For instance, a doctor in the United States can consult with a patient in Africa through telemedicine, a feat that would have been impossible without technology. However, despite the convenience of these technologies, they have also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which are crucial for building strong relationships and developing interpersonal skills. People are becoming increasingly dependent on technology for communication, leading to social isolation and loneliness.

Another impact of technology is that it has revolutionized the way we work, making it more efficient and productive. For instance, computer software, automation, and artificial intelligence have replaced many manual labor jobs, leading to increased accuracy, speed, and efficiency in the workplace. However, these advancements have also led to job displacement and unemployment, with many workers being replaced by machines. Additionally, the constant need to stay connected and plugged in has led to a culture of overwork and burnout, which can have negative effects on mental and physical health.

Moreover, technology has transformed the way we access information, making it easier and faster to find answers to our questions. The internet has made knowledge more accessible, enabling people to educate themselves on various subjects and broaden their horizons. However, this ease of access to information has also led to a rise in misinformation and fake news. The internet has become a breeding ground for conspiracy theories and propaganda, leading to a lack of trust in traditional news sources and institutions. This has a negative impact on democracy, as people are less informed and less likely to make informed decisions.

In conclusion, while technology has made our lives easier and more efficient in many ways, it is not always a positive force in modern life. It has led to social isolation, job displacement, overwork and burnout, and the spread of misinformation. Therefore, it is imperative that we acknowledge the negative impacts of technology and find ways to mitigate them while still reaping it's benefits. This can be achieved through education, regulation, and responsible use of technology. Only then can we fully harness the power of technology to create a better world.",1
"The arguments for and against the use of genetically modified food products have been around since the technology was first developed. Genetically modified (GM) foods are organisms that have had their genetic makeup altered through the insertion of foreign genes in an effort to make them more productive or resilient. While GM foods can potentially provide many benefits, such as higher yields, resistance to pests and diseases, improved shelf life and nutritional value, there are also a number of risks associated with them which must be considered before fully embracing this new technology. On one hand, advocates for using GM food products argue that they can help enhance food production output by making crops more resistant to herbicides or insect infestations as well as reducing post-harvest losses from spoilage or disease contamination. In addition, proponents claim that GM crop varieties may even offer advantages in terms of nutrition by increasing vitamin content or providing other desirable traits not normally found in traditional varieties. As a result of these potential benefits it is argued that the use of GM technologies could ultimately lead to greater global food security due to increased productivity levels in developing countries where resources may already be strained. However, opponents point out several potential problems with GM foods including possible negative impacts on human health if allergens/toxins become present due to genetic modification; environmental concerns such as disruption of natural ecosystems when non-native species are released into existing habitats; and socio-economic implications such as decreased diversity among crop plants leading to monocultures rather than richer biodiversity at work on local farms. Furthermore questions remain regarding intellectual property rights over seeds containing patented genetics which has led some farmers who unknowingly used GMOs supplied by seed companies into legal battles over patent infringement charges despite having no intent nor desire for doing so originally. In conclusion then it appears clear that while there is great promise held within the field of genetically modified foods there are many issues which should be thoroughly examined before full embrace takes place including considerations about health safety regulations; environmental sustainability practices",1

The philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer said, Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing. I am agree with this statement because there is not better way to influence others than have a good example by our owm behavior. The change start in us to show a good example of habitat, religion, responsability, respect to others, and over all humility.

The first reason is that nowadays the people see and judge of how peple look like, how people are dressed, or if people are old or young, in that way they are giving examples to others to judge the people, instead of give a good impression or example to other that everyone needs to love each other like they love their selves, no matter how they are. Respect other to get respect, always kind with everyone no matter who they are. Helping each other everywhere. Be a good citizenship: Payin your bills, respecting the laws, and be a good neighborhood. Because without examples, no one can make differences.

The second reason: Be a kind person, study to have a good future. For example: I am in High School I am graduate this year. I am a English learner. When I came here in US I did't know how to speak English, but I came to school, I study hard all the words, and I practiced my English. Now I know the languaje, not at all but I can defend my self. I want to encorage all hispanic people to learn English or let their child to go to school, and I know that is not easy but not impossible. I hope to give a good example for all hispanics. I will keep doing it to influence them to learn the language of this country.

Some people say that there are many ways to influence others like with words and not with actions. However, they are wrong because how people will change without an example of life, like Martin Luther King, he was a great person, and he passed through a lot of things, and everybody knows that he influenced a lot of people in that time and I think that he still influencing more people even that he is not with us anymore.

In conclusion, giving example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. encoraging them to learn english, helping each other, loving other no matter their religion. Influencing lifes with actions is better than jsut words. What would happen if no one wants to be an example for other.",0
"Introduction:
Hey there! I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, as a NASA scientist, I'm here to convinced you that it's just a natural landform. I know, I know, it looks like a face, but sometimes nature can be pretty clever. In this essay, I'll explain why I think the Face is just a regular ol' hill.

Claim 1: The Face is just a hill with shadows.
The article states that the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows (Paragraph 3). This means that when the sun shines on the hill, it creates shadows that make it look like a face. It's like when you see a rabbit in the clouds - it's just a trick of the light! If you look at the picture in the article, you can see that the face is actually just a bunch of shadows and highlights.

Claim 2: The Face is made of natural materials.
The article also mentions that the Face is made of a hill of rock and soil (Paragraph 2). This means that it's not some weird, alien material - it's just regular old Earth stuff. And, as the article points out, the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth (Paragraph 4). So, it's not like aliens came down and dumped some strange, face-making material on the planet. It's just nature doing its thing.

Claim 3: Other natural features on Mars look like faces too.
The article talks about how other natural features on Mars also look like faces (Paragraph 5). This means that it's not just the Face that looks like a face - other things on the planet do too! It's like how you might see a face in a cloud or a tree trunk. It's just our brains being silly and seeing patterns where there aren't any.

Evidence from the article to support my claims:

* the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows (Paragraph 3)
* the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth (Paragraph 4)
* other natural features on Mars also look like faces (Paragraph 5)

Conclusion:
So, there you have it! The Face on Mars might look like a face, but it's actually just a natural landform. It's made of regular stuff like rocks and soil, and it's just a trick of the light that makes it look like a face. I hope I've convinced you that there's no need to call in the aliens - it's just good old Mother Nature doing her thing.",1
"Are you ever just stuck and don't know what to do? Well yea, asking one person could be could, but what could be even better is if you ask multiple people. I'll tell you some reasons. Whenever you get stuck you ask someone about it right? Well asking multiple people could get rid of all those problems you face when only asking one, it could be better, and more useful. I think when someone questioned's multiple people it's good because, maybe the one person they asked originally doesn't know, or even you could get your own ideas and then you could choose.

When you ask a single person something they might not know, or you might not like the answer. Asking lots of different people can increase your chance of getting a good response. For example, I had a friend ask me once what's the answer for the math homework? Now I really didn't know so I said I'm not sure, but maybe someone else does They left unsatisfied and unsure. I saw them walking around asking other people, and sure enough, he came back with all the answers in less then thirty minutes! Don't worry we were allowed to have partners so we weren't cheating, but see what asking lots of people can do!

When you have a couple of ideas, but do not know what to pick from, ask other people they can give you a better understanding and idea on what to choose. So, this happened about three months ago. I was getting basketball shoes and I was stuck between two pairs, I then sent them to a group chat with my friends within minutes I had a clear winner, later it came to my attention that they were really good basketball shoes so I am glad I let them help me. On another occasion though, maybe you want to go to kings dominion and the beach for a summer party, but you aren't so sure it doesn't matter to you so you ask other people, that then gives them what you like and they like.

Asking one person can be good if just want one opinion, and one response. In the long run though, asking multiple people is so much better, for when you are stuck, need answers and lots of other stuff. Anyways i'm gonna go but I hope this essay helped you get a better understanding on why it's better to seek mutliple opinions and answers.",0
"The question of which English language skill is more important for Chinese learners is an issue that has been long debated. Some people believe that prioritizing reading in English is the way to go, while others stress the importance of speaking. In this essay, I argue that it is much more important to focus on speaking skill since it fuels acquiring other language skills.

In my opinion, speaking is the most important skill for Chinese learners of English. This is because speaking English is the foundation of acquiring other language skills. When we engage in conversations, we are exposed to a wide range of language and structures which helps to build our knowledge of English. For instance, by talking to native English speakers, we can pick up naturally-used expressions, which can be difficult to learn from textbooks. Furthermore, speaking also helps us to understand and remember vocabulary and grammar more effectively. This is because, when we practice speaking, we are actively engaging with the language and are more likely to remember it.

Moreover, speaking English can enhance our overall confidence. When we can express ourselves effectively, we feel more secure, which can help us to interact more freely with native speakers and other Chinese learners of English. This, in turn, increases the amount of input and output, leading to improved language skills.

In addition, speaking English can be incredibly fun and rewarding. We can make friends from all over the world, share our experiences, and learn more about each other's cultures. By engaging in conversations, we can also gain a deeper insight into English-speaking countries and their customs.

In conclusion, although reading in English is an effective way to improve language skills, speaking should be the top priority for Chinese learners of English. This is because speaking provides the foundation to acquiring other language skills, helps to increase overall confidence, and can be incredibly rewarding.",1
"Dear Mr. Senate, I believe that we should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think we should change it because it's unfair to voters, you can't trust that the electors will vote for who you want to vote for, and then there is the disaster factor'.

First off, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. As Bradford Plumer pointed out in the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.So basically what he is saying is that if one state already has a lead and the candidate has no chance of winning he isn't going to focus on them. The candidate is only going to focus on the states where he has a chance of swinging the vote towards himhence the term swing states.For example during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all.

Second of all, you cant trust that the electors that you vote for are going to vote for the president you want. For example, what if you want to vote for Obama and so you vote for the elector that says he will vote for Obama, but then when its time to vote the elector changes his mind and she votes for rodney instead. Now what? You put your trust in one person and she didnt vote for who you wanted. Now you might have to wait another four years to have a chance of getting a different president.

Last but not least, one of the single best arguments against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor'. In the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,it states,Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. The oppsong claim states that we should keep the electoral college. Some reasons stated in the article, In Defense of the Electoral COllege: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,are,A dispute over the outcome of an ELectoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral Colllege requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidatesas we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. The elctoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.",0
"Teens should not be on a phone while in a vehicle.

Being on a cell phone increases the risk of being in an accident. Many teens are on their phones while driving because they are either talking to their friends or boyfriends and girlfriends. Teens don't understand the risk that they are making for other people on the roads.

Many teens today are getting distracted by their phones and causing accidents and majority of the teens that are in accidents are dying. Over half of the teenagers in the united states have admitted that they use their phones while driving. Teens that are distracted by their phone are also putting pedestrians in danger along with themselves. People also die every day because someone is not watching the road and is on their phone. They also think that the hands-free method is safe because they can use both of their hands but it's still not safe because people are still getting into wreaks.

Many teens are glued to their phone 24/7 and when they are driving, they still have their phone in their hand. Teens think that they need to have a phone in their hand and they think that if they don't have it in their hand they will die without it but if you are driving and on your phone you will die because you can get a really bad car accident. Teens nowadays are the main causes of car accidents because they are always on their phones talking to people and not putting their phones down while driving which is dangerous to other drivers on the road.

I know that other teens will disagree with me that they need to have their phone in their hand while driving just in case of an emergency but that's not a reason to have their phone in their hand.

Many teens also say that their parents need them to contact them if something bad happens to them while they are driving but if they are driving with their phone in their hand something bad will happen to them.

Teens don't need to have their phones in their hand while driving because it is very dangerous to them and others on the road even the people that are in the car with them. Like I said at the beginning of this essay cell phones are increasing the risk of being in an accident for teens.",0
"In an age of technological advancement and increased awareness of environmental impacts, it's worth examining the advantages of limiting car usage, as demonstrated by various case studies across the world. Advocated by the principles of “smart planning,” curbing the dependency on cars presents several environmental, health, and social benefits. Adopting avenues for limiting car use, cities, and suburbs worldwide have started presenting sustainable models for living (Rosenthal).

Vauban, a suburb on the outskirts of Freiburg, Germany, provides a compelling testament to the benefits of a “car-free” life, with 70% of its families not owning cars and 57% selling their cars before moving in (Rosenthal). This has instilled a sense of peace and contentment among the community members, fostering healthier and happier lifestyles. Similarly, Bogota, Colombia, holds an annual Day Without Cars, promoting alternative transportation methods and reducing smog, both important steps toward environmental sustainability (Selsky). Arguably these cases evidence how limiting car usage can enhance the quality of life and contribute to a more sustainable environment.

Cars, vital to the suburb life in the 20th century, have become a noteworthy contributor to adverse environmental impacts, accounting for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, cars contribute significantly to the total GHG emissions with up to 50% recorded in some car-intensive areas (Rosenthal). This is a crucial factor to consider, as it underlines the profound environmental benefits of limiting car usage. 

In Paris, a city once coated with a choking layer of smog had its congestion reduced by 60% once a partial driving ban was enforced (Duffer). Moreover, the United States has also seen a steady decline in car usage, with significant drops in the number of miles driven per person, particularly among younger demographics (Rosenthal). This indicates that a cultural shift may be on the horizon, with society gradually beginning to move away from a car-dependent lifestyle.

Advancements in technology and shifts in societal norms, such as the rise of carpool apps, telecommuting due to the internet, and renewed interest in city centers, can contribute significantly to this transition. These changes open up possibilities for innovative approaches to planning our cities, which can accommodate less car usage while still ensuring convenience and efficiency (Rosenthal). Public transportation, cycle-sharing, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructures are all elements that can replace the dominance of cars in our society.

In conclusion, limiting car usage presents an array of advantages for society, ranging from better health and increased happiness to a more sustainable environment. While such a transition may be challenging, international examples prove it to be both possible and beneficial. By adopting smarter planning and prioritizing public and non-motorized forms of transport, we can ensure a sustainable future for ourselves and generations to come.",1
"The Chinese culture has long been based on tradition, and as a result, many people in China believe that it is better not to tell a cancer patient the truth about the condition, as this may upset or distress them. There are a number of reasons why this tradition exists, and many of them have to do with the belief that it is better not to upset or distress a person in this situation.

One reason is that it is thought that telling a cancer patient the truth could lead to them becoming overwhelmed and frightened, and this could have a negative impact on their treatment. It is also thought that it is better not to upset or distress them in order to allow them to focus on getting well. Furthermore, it is believed that by keeping the cancer a secret, the patient may be more likely to survive the condition. In some cases, it is also thought that by not letting a cancer patient know the full extent of their condition, they may be more likely to fight the disease to the end.

There are a number of reasons why the Chinese culture believes that it is better not to tell cancer patients the truth about their condition, and as a result, this is a practice that is often followed. While there are certainly benefits to this tradition, there are also a number of drawbacks. In particular, it can be difficult for cancer patients to receive the best possible treatment if they do not know the full extent of their condition, and it can be difficult for them to cope with the news if they are not given the opportunity to prepare themselves. Additionally, it can be difficult for families to cope with the news if the patient does not die as a result of the cancer, and this can lead to a lot of distress and sadness.",1
"The resurgence of vinyl as a music medium is one of the most popular trends in recent years. With over 14 million records sold in 2018, it seems that the sound and feel of old-school records are now being appreciated more than ever before. While digital downloads and streaming dominate the industry, there’s something special about having a physical record you can hold and admire for its artwork or even just the feeling of listening to something tangible. So why has vinyl become so popular? Well, for starters, there’s a certain nostalgia associated with it – many people grew up with records playing on their parents' turntable when they were kids; hearing those same songs on vinyl brings back memories from another time. Additionally, thanks to modern technology like PCM converters (which can make an excellent replica of analog sound) and Bluetooth speakers (that allow you to enjoy your favorite tunes wirelessly), not only do these vintage pieces look great but they also offer superior sound quality compared to digital formats such as MP3s or CDs which often have heavily compressed audio files that lose out on much detail. Furthermore, when buying new releases on wax instead of CD/digital you typically get higher bitrates resulting in better fidelity which adds further value for audiophiles who appreciate nuances within their music. Finally, some artists put extra effort into making exclusive versions only available through independent record stores giving avid fans yet another reason to pick up these classic albums!. This newfound revival has been accompanied by an increased presence in pop culture - mainstream movies like Baby Driver feature characters shopping around at a record store looking for obscure tracks while hip hop moguls like Dr Dre have personally released limited edition box sets featuring rare gems from his archives exclusively through chosen outlets – all testament to how influential this format remains today despite decades having gone by since its heyday back in the 70s & 80s!.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the preservation of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a system based on popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College serves as a crucial mechanism in our democratic system for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, where disputes over the result could occur more frequently, the Electoral College guarantees that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear and decisive outcome, reducing the likelihood of a prolonged and contentious election process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president being everyone's president. As the system requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, no particular region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This encourages candidates to campaign across the entire nation, listening to and addressing the concerns of voters from different regions. By doing so, the Electoral College ensures that the elected president represents the interests of diverse populations and prevents potential feelings of disenfranchisement among citizens from unrepresented regions.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This has the benefit of engaging voters in those states and encouraging them to pay close attention to the campaign and the candidates' messages. The focused attention of these thoughtful voters allows them to make well-informed decisions during the election, ultimately resulting in a more informed electorate.

The Electoral College also balances the political influence between small and large states. While the Constitution grants disproportionate power to small states in the Senate, the Electoral College redistributes some of that weight by providing more attention to large states during presidential campaigns. Candidates are compelled to address the concerns and needs of citizens in both small and large states, ensuring that no state is overlooked or disregarded.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, which could complicate and prolong the electoral process. In its current form, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, providing stability and efficiency to the presidential election process.

While some argue against the Electoral College, suggesting that it discourages potential voters in states they consider unwinnable, the fact remains that a significant portion of the American population still participates in presidential elections. This suggests that voters are motivated to express their political preferences rather than solely focusing on the impact of their vote on the outcome. The Electoral College does not undermine voter engagement in presidential elections; instead, it balances the interests of various states and guarantees a fair representation of the entire nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a vital component of our democratic system, providing certainty of outcome, ensuring that the president is everyone's president, promoting thoughtful voter engagement, balancing state influence, and avoiding run-off elections. Its merits outweigh the arguments put forth in favor of a popular vote for the president. I urge you to support the preservation of the Electoral College and resist any efforts to change it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Broad knowledge is always better than specialized knowledge. It is always better to be a “jack of all trades” and have a basic understanding of many subjects, than to be a “master of one” and know everything about one specific subject. Here are three reasons why:

1) Specialized knowledge can be a hindrance.

If you only know about one specific subject, you will be at a disadvantage when you encounter something that falls outside of your area of expertise. For example, if you are a medical doctor who specializes in heart surgery, you will be at a disadvantage if you are faced with a patient who needs brain surgery. On the other hand, if you are a general practitioner, you will be able to better handle the situation because you have a broad understanding of medicine.

2) Specialized knowledge can be limiting.

If you only know about one specific subject, you will be limited in your ability to think creatively and find solutions to problems. For example, if you are a mechanic who specializes in fixing cars, you will be limited in your ability to fix a broken washing machine. On the other hand, if you are a general handyman, you will be able to find a solution because you have a broad understanding of different mechanical systems.

3) Specialized knowledge can be outdated.

If you only know about one specific subject, your knowledge may quickly become outdated. For example, if you are a computer programmer who specializes in COBOL, your skills will quickly become obsolete when newer programming languages come out. On the other hand, if you are a general computer programmer, you will be able to adapt to the new languages because you have a broad understanding of computer programming.

In conclusion, it is always better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Specialized knowledge can be a hindrance, limiting, and outdated. It is better to be a “jack of all trades” and have a basic understanding of many subjects, than to be a “master of one” and know everything about one specific subject.",1
"Safety Protocol: Driving With Cell Phones

At this time the world has made so many innovative improvements, including the mobility of phones (cell phones). Phones are an everyday need now, and so is the mobility of your own, you have to get to places some way. Cars have improved a lot over many years. Mobility is vital today and with so many people with priorities of leaving home in a car, safety has to be the first thing prioritised. Many accidents, many ending lethal, have occurred due to the use of mobile cell phones while behind the wheel of an auto machine. To cause less accidents this needs to be called to attention.

Multitasking has become a lethal task while driving, phones have caused so many deaths while driving and people till this day continue to about and risk their life as well doing the same. According to ICEBIKE Article: The 25 Scariest Texting and Driving Accident Statistics about 1,300,000 people die each year from Texting and Driving accidents. A lot of times there's another person that gets hit by the texter and driver ultimately taking both lives. The seriousness of the actions taken everyday aren't stressed enough and people do not react until they are a victim of it.

Development has taken driving and using a cellular device to a better and safer place. According to NBC News: Bluetooth Presence increases in automobiles Over 3 Million cars have an bluetooth system inside. The bluetooth allows you to access your phone in various ways while driving at the same time. Phone Calls, Voice Messages, Music, Weather, and etc. Available while operating your automobile. It has its perks although, it doesn't beat not using your cellular device at all.

Cell phones should not be present in your hand as a driver. It is in place and as should be, cops will pull you over if they see it. They're only protecting your life and a lot of others from more casualties and statistics to be made for the wrong reasons. Utilize your cars tools most cars today come equipped with them and the set up takes no more then an hour.

As stated we've made many innovative advancements over the years and there's just so many more options than risk. Take into consideration all the people and their families you put in danger including your very own life. Although it may be hard to resist that one sentence or two, leaving it just for a little will help keep you, and everyone around you safer.

"In today's world, having knowledge about various academic subjects is considered essential. However, some people argue that it is better to specialize in one specific subject. While there are benefits to both approaches, I firmly believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous. In this essay, I will explain why I hold this opinion and provide examples to support it.

Firstly, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help us in our personal and professional lives. For instance, if we have knowledge of history, we can understand the impact of past events on current affairs. Similarly, if we have knowledge of science, we can understand the latest technological advancements and their implications. This knowledge can help us make informed decisions in our personal lives, such as choosing the right career path or investing in the right stocks. Moreover, it can also help us in our professional lives, such as making informed decisions in our job roles or being able to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds.

Secondly, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help us become well-rounded individuals. It can help us appreciate different perspectives and develop critical thinking skills. For example, if we have knowledge of literature, we can understand different cultural perspectives and develop empathy towards people from different backgrounds. Similarly, if we have knowledge of philosophy, we can develop critical thinking skills and learn how to analyze complex issues. This well-roundedness can help us become more open-minded, tolerant, and adaptable individuals.

Lastly, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help us become lifelong learners. It can help us develop a passion for learning and continue to learn throughout our lives. For example, if we have knowledge of art, we can develop an appreciation for different forms of art and continue to learn about them throughout our lives. Similarly, if we have knowledge of economics, we can continue to learn about the latest economic trends and their implications. This lifelong learning can help us stay intellectually curious and engaged throughout our lives.

In conclusion, while there are benefits to specializing in one specific subject, I believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous. It can help us in our personal and professional lives, make us well-rounded individuals, and help us become lifelong learners. Therefore, I would encourage everyone to explore different academic subjects and develop a broad knowledge base.",1
"When exploring the benefits of working in a group versus working alone, it is clear that there are many advantages to engaging in collaborative work. Group projects can provide a diverse mix of ideas, skills, and perspectives that can enhance the output of the task. Working in a team also allows for strong communication skills to be honed, which can be beneficial in both an academic and professional setting. Furthermore, group work can also be more efficient, as tasks can be delegated among team members and achieved faster than working alone. 

However, there are also disadvantages to working in a team due to conflicting opinions or lack of clear communication. It is therefore important to familiarize oneself with successful techniques for group work such as properly outlining the task, understanding the strengths of each group member, setting clear goals, and creating guidelines for communication. By following these techniques, you can ensure that the collaborative work experience is successful and that the group can achieve their shared goals.",1
"It could be of good use. For example say you have a student that isnt having a good week. Lets say you cant fully tell if they are in a good or bad mood right. You could just bring the FACS Machinery and let that be the judge. We could also say that there are people who know how to hide emotions physically. So looking at them might let you think they are happy but really they are sad, lonely, depressed, ect. That would be another good momment for that to be there. To let you know how the person is really feeling.

There are both pros and cons to having this machine ill go over the pros first. Some pros are that you will be able to tell someones mood. Aswell as that you will be able to tell if someone is lying about there true feelings which could really be a problem when it comes to things like depression leading to suicides and things. Finally being able to know someones emotions could work to your favor as a teacher say someone is confused but to shy or scared to ask. Use the FACS machine to get them out of there. Some cons would be things like it could take priceless time out of your teaching to use the machine. They didnt give a estimate of how long it takes but i'd expect it to be a pretty long time. Also it could take a big price hit on the schools around the nation, I couldnt imagine this being a cheap device. Finally it could be useless. Some teachers wont take time out of their class to use it because frankly they just dont/wont care. Which would be a total bust seeing that the school would waste so much money just for it to go to waste.

I honestly think its amazing how someone can tell you how they are feeling at that moment. The diversity must be off the walls. it must be 1 in a million to get the same feeling. Its crazy the things we can do now a days with technology. People are coming up with more and more ways to initiate a more satisfactory lifestyle. Its always good to see someone take that inititive and start something like this. Seeing this I wonder what could be next.",0

Electing our president through electoral votes takes care of minor problems such as favorism of regions .Each state is giving electoral votes based on their population , no region such as south, north, east, ect.. has enough electoral votes to choose a president.(source 3 paragraph 19)  So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win A president with a favorite region may make the rest of the country feel like their votes doesn't count and the new president will show no attention to their interests and their problems. Electing our presidents via Electoral College is the best way to make our country feel like our president is everyones president .

Most americans may prefer a direct election over the kind we have now. (source 2: paragraph 9) ... according to a poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency Americans think that by choosing our leader by popular vote their votes will be represented more . Americans are also scared of a tie between candidates since the electoral vote numer is a even number ( 538 in total ) but they only need 270 to win the elections. They shouldnt be worried about this a tie could happen but is mostlikely never going to happen. The biggest complain about the winner take all system is that it is unfair to voters since cindidates campaign in big states or states with a lot of electoral votes , they dont spend time on states they know they have no chance of winning . ( source 2: paragraph 13) During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. but this isn't completely true , the winner take all method motivates candidates to focus their efforts on the  toss-up  states. Voters in these states really listen to the competeting candidates knowing they are responsible for deciding the election . But of course no voter's vote swings a national election .. Voters in presidentia elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election  (source 3: paragraph 23) One persons vote is not going to decide the election so no matter what point of view yu look at it from , electoral vote is the best way to choose our leader .",0
"Venus, Earth's twin sister is a extordinary planet that may have been the most earth like planet in our solar system according to paragraph 4. It is also stated that Venus may have probably been covered largely with oceans that could support all form of life. Due to the dense atmosphere and toasty temperatures around 170 degrees fahrenheit. It has been impossiple to let alone land on venus but even taking samples of Venus's rock, gas, or anything else from a distance. Many drones have been sent there to gather information about Venus according to paragraph 2. Each mission to land on Venus has ben unmanned due to the problem of no spacecraft not being able to survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even with all these issues with venus, stated in paragraph 7. NASA is still working on other approaches to studying Venus because again it is a extordinary planet that is said to have been suitible for all forms of life. Finding out what happend to make Venus be in the state it is right now would help the human race from stopping Earth from becoming like Venus. There has been many ideas to get a view on venus ground conditions such as peering from a orbiting ship but that would only give a limited insight due to the dense atmosphere. On paragraph 6 it is stated Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. That just goes to show you how landing on Venus or even getting the smallest bit of sample of it is a worthy pursit despite the risks and dangers of it. The curiosity of the human race is a powerful thing, Even though Venus is described as a dangerous planet. One day we will figure out the secrets Venus hold and perhaps even have a human land on the surface as well, until then we will just keep on working on more innovations that will one day allow us to get the insight of Venus.",0
"The Benefits of Gardening for Mental Health Gardening is a hobby that has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more and more people realizing the many health benefits it can offer. One such benefit is its potential to improve mental health and well-being. This paper will discuss how spending time gardening can reduce stress levels, help manage depression, and provide an outlet for creativity. Stress relief is one of the primary benefits associated with gardening. Planting flowers or vegetables requires one to focus on something other than their worries which makes it easier to relax and temporarily escape from stressors. Additionally, studies have shown that gardeners’ bodies produce lower levels of cortisol (the hormone released during times of stress) compared to those who don’t garden at all1. In addition to helping reduce stress in the moment, gardening also encourages mindfulness through activities like weeding or pruning which are repetitive and slow moving enough so that they allow us be fully engaged in the present moment without getting distracted by our thoughts2 – something that may be especially useful if you struggle with anxiety or racing thoughts due to a mental illness. Another way gardening positively impacts mental health is through its ability to increase feelings of accomplishment3; seeing your hard work pay off as plants grow bigger each day gives you a sense of satisfaction that could make this activity beneficial for those struggling with low self-esteem or depression4 . Moreover, being outside surrounded by nature may have additional mood boosting effects since exposure to natural settings has been linked with increased happiness5 . Furthermore , having a regular routine –such as tending your garden– can give structure as well as purpose6 -something which may be lacking when battling depression7 . Finally ,gardening provides an opportunity for creative expression; designing flower beds or arranging decorations among plants lets us express ourselves freely8 -a great way for anyone looking for a healthy distraction from negative emotions9 . . All things considered then , there is no doubt that gardening presents",1
"Failures have a bad reputation, but in reality, they can be crucial stepping stones on the way to success. When faced with a setback, the power of enthusiasm can help someone take it in stride and use it as an opportunity to grow and learn. History is full of examples of successes that were born out of trials and tribulations. 

Take invention, for example. Thomas Edison famously said that “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work”. This type of resilience and positivity helped him create inventions that have made a huge impact on the world. From the light bulb to the phonograph, his successes wouldn’t have been possible if he had let his failures discourage him.

Medicine is another field in which numerous successes have arisen from prior failures. After a series of failed experiments, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, which has saved millions of lives since. His perseverance, combined with enthusiasm for his work, enabled him to turn failure into a chance to progress and succeed. 

The same principle applies to students, who often experience “failure” in the form of poor grades or lack of understanding of a topic. By continuing to give their best effort while maintaining a can-do attitude, they can find new ways to grasp concepts or work around any obstacles that stand in their way. Ultimately, it’s their enthusiasm that helps them push past these setbacks and benefit from the lessons learned. 

In conclusion, enthusiasm is an incredibly valuable resource when it comes to learning from failure and achieving success. From Edison’s light bulb to Fleming’s penicillin to students who overcome obstacles to excel in their classes, there are countless success stories where enthusiasm has been the driving force. Rather than viewing failure as a large setback, we should always keep in mind that it can be a learning opportunity.",1
"Phones and Driving is No Bueno

Phones and driving have been around or influenced in our society for a very long time. Fatal injuries of friends, families, or even fellow class mates have been a victim to this incident. We have the option to say no more! Why wouldn't the state governments all throughout the U.S. want to induce a law such as this in each state? For certain we could create a major decrease in the percentages of car crashes for our citizens. Think of when you are walking, you don't stare into your phone because you will bump into other people walking, so why would you do that while driving? Therefore, phones and driving should be banned due to poor results and statistics.

There are roughly about more than one hundred thousand people who are involved with phones while driving. For example, Mississippi has banned texting and driving, but has yet to ban holding the phone in their hand while driving. Now think to yourself, what are the chances of someone responding to a hilarious text from their friend? Deep down I believe anyone's answer would be a high chance. The moment you take focus off the road even if it's for half of a second, you increase your chance of being able to miss something causing you to make a horrible judgment call on the road. A quarter percent of car crashes is due to the usage of a cellphone. We should have the encouragement to change that quarter into a penny or no chance at all!

How much do you value your life? Even if your answer to that is Not much at all., what about someone you cherish and that cherishes you? People tend to do more for others over themselves. Also, passengers of your vehicle aren't the only ones that you are accountable for. That's right; think of the pedestrians who tend to use their feet as transportation. You have a high chance of endangering them if you take your focus from the road and onto your phone. Even if no one matters to you and all that's in value to you is money, you're still in for a rude awakening. If you think insurance is a burden to you and your financial life right now just think about how a citation for texting and driving will affect you. Think about your life and how multiple areas of it can potentially be affected by a poor action to use your phone while driving.

What most people don't know is that the mind is trained to do one thing at a time in the result of having controlled and efficient focus. Imagine how the usage of a phone can take your mind from what is in front of you on the road. You mentally must be in a good state to perform safe driving. Teen drivers can be affected by this heavily. Due to a little amount of experience of driving. One more thing that can affect their driving is social media and how it is excessively used in today's generation. Last thing parent's want is a phone call stating that their kid has been in a car accident. We could simply all agree on this.

In conclusion, phones and driving should be banned due to poor results and statistics as we stated above. We have a huge percentage of human beings that are affected by this distraction. We need to take away the cause, so the effect ceases. High values are at a major risk if you make the mistake to use your phone while driving. So, the next time you drive, take your values into consideration. You need to take full control of your focus and create a great, determined, and powerful state while driving. Don't get caught up in this distraction, it isn't urgent while you are driving, get to your destination safely first!",0
"The Effects of Social Media on Teenagers' Mental Health. When it comes to teenage mental health, social media can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it provides an environment for teens to connect with others in their age group, share ideas, and even find support when going through difficult times. However, many issues arise from frequent use of sites such as Facebook or Instagram that could have serious implications for teenagers’ emotional well-being. One issue is the comparison game; when teenagers log onto social media they are exposed to other people’s seemingly perfect lives which can lead them to compare themselves with others in terms of appearance or lifestyle choices—causing feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Another issue is cyberbullying; some platforms provide anonymity which gives bullies more power than ever before since victims may not know who is behind the hurtful comments and threats being made online. This type of behavior has been linked to depression as well as suicidal thoughts among young people who feel isolated and helpless in the face of relentless ridicule from peers on digital platforms. Lastly, there are known links between too much time spent on social networking sites (anything over two hours per day) and anxiety disorders due to constant stimulation provided by phones and laptops that keeps users hooked into this virtual world instead of interacting with the real world around them. It also decreases physical activity among those addicted because they become less interested in outdoor activities such as sports or walks so they spend most days glued to screens indoors leading sedentary lifestyles—which further harms their mental health due to lack exercise associated benefits like improved moods or decreased stress levels. . From these dangers posed by excessive use of social media amongst adolescents today, it is apparent how important it is for parents/guardians/educators etc…to ensure that young people understand how best utilize technology responsibly—and if necessary limits should be put into place regarding screen time usage especially during school hours where",1
"The future of transportation is a topic of much debate, with many experts predicting a shift towards greener and more sustainable modes of transport. This has led some to believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. While this prediction may seem plausible, it is important to consider all the factors that could influence the number of cars on the road in the coming years.

One of the main reasons why there may be fewer cars in use in twenty years is the growing popularity of alternative forms of transportation. Bicycles, electric scooters, and public transport are becoming more accessible and affordable, and many people are choosing to use these modes of transport instead of driving. For example, in cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen, cycling has become the primary mode of transport for many residents, and this trend is spreading to other cities around the world. Similarly, electric scooters have become a popular alternative to cars for short journeys, and many cities have introduced bike-sharing and scooter-sharing schemes to encourage their use.

Another factor that could lead to fewer cars on the road is the rise of autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars are expected to become more common in the coming years, and many experts predict that they will eventually replace human-driven cars altogether. This could lead to a reduction in the number of cars on the road, as autonomous vehicles will be able to operate more efficiently and safely than human-driven cars. Additionally, self-driving cars could be shared among multiple users, further reducing the number of cars needed on the road.

However, it is important to note that there are also factors that could lead to an increase in the number of cars on the road in the coming years. For example, as developing countries become more affluent, there is likely to be a rise in car ownership as more people can afford to buy cars. Additionally, the trend towards remote working and online shopping could lead to more people using cars for leisure activities, such as going on road trips or visiting friends and family.

In conclusion, while it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today, it is difficult to predict with certainty what the future of transportation will look like. While alternative forms of transportation and autonomous vehicles may lead to a reduction in the number of cars on the road, other factors such as rising affluence and changing work and leisure patterns could lead to an increase in car ownership. Ultimately, the future of transportation will be shaped by a complex interplay of economic, social, and technological factors, and it is impossible to know for sure what the outcome will be.",1
"The effects of single-use plastic on marine life have become a major environmental concern in recent years. The production and consumption of single-use plastics, such as straws, bottles, bags, utensils and packaging materials has dramatically increased over the past decade – resulting in higher levels of plastic waste ending up in our oceans. This is having devastating impacts on numerous species living beneath the waves including turtles, fish and seabirds who often mistake small pieces of plastic for food or get tangled up in its debris. The problem with single-use plastics is that they are rarely recycled or disposed of properly after use. Even though many consumers may think their disposable items will be taken to a recycling plant, this simply isn't true - much ends up being dumped into landfill sites where it can take hundreds of years to decompose. Unfortunately due to ocean currents and winds large portions end up floating around at sea before eventually washing ashore or sinking to the bottom - where they remain indefinitely causing harm to wildlife habitats in the process. One way we can help reduce our reliance on single-use plastics is by using refillable alternatives instead when possible (e.g., reusing water bottles rather than buying new ones). We should also try cutting down on unnecessary packaging whenever possible – opting to buy foods like grains and pulses from bulk bins instead which can be stored afterwards without needing additional containers/wrappers etc. If individuals were able make even small changes like this then collectively it would make a huge impact!. . Ultimately reducing our dependence on these one time use products isn't just beneficial for animal welfare but also helps protect our planet's valuable resources too . This means there are multiple reasons why we should all consider making an effort towards changing how we purchase goods today – ensuring future generations don’t have to suffer from similar environmental problems tomorrow",1
"The Face, made by aliens or just a natural landform? The Face, believe it, is just a natural landform on Mars. Why, the Face, is a natural landform is because, for one we do have images of this landform, the Face is also like a natural landform we have here on earth, and if there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars it would benifit NASA, so why think we're hiding anything? Maybe there was once aliens, but the facts just don't prove that to be true, therefore it is indeed just a natural landform.

We do have many images of the Face. The very first one that was taken in 1976 does indeed look like a face, but over the years wtith new technology it doesn't look like a face anymore. Now you may say that it's because of erosion and blah blah, but it's not. It has always been just a mesa which is very common on Mars, New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASAs Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa. With our better technology it clearly shows that it is indeed not a face, therefore maybe you should stop believing it is.

The Face, is like one of the natural landforms we have here on earth. These natural landforms are natural occuring lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa and they look about the same as the many that are on Mars. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. All in all, Garvin is a real, bona fide scientist, so why not believe him?

If that still didn't convince you then this might. Simply if there was ever life on any other planet in our solar system we, NASA, would highly benifit from it. We would be able to study them and learn everything about them. So why would we hide it? Well we could if they, the aliens, didn't feel very comfortable with us telling everyone about them wanting to go see our leader and what-not. Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Yes we could be hiding it from you for their sake not ours, so before you think that we're hiding things from you for us think about the aliens too.

Sure maybe we're all wrong and in the end you were right and there were once alien life forms on Mars, but that simply can't be true. The things we have; the images, an example of one here on earth, and the realization that if there were ever life forms on Mars it would benifit NASA and everyone else on Earth. So if you would please take your skeptical specticals off and realize that not everything you think is right is right, because maybe you're wrong. Who knows though there could be aliens out there on Mars hiding or maybe they're watching us as you read this.",0
"I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a messa brutte which is a landform so that gives the answer right there. This is why I degree with whoever says that aliens formed the face on Mars.",0
"source 1: what is the electoral collage?

by the office of the federal register

The electoral college is a proccess,not a place. The founding established it in the U.S. constitution as a compromise between election of the president and the congress and the election of the president by a polpular vote of qualified citizens.(

paragraph, 1 sentance, 1).

The electoral college consists of 538 electors a majority of 270 electors votes are required and is reqiured to elect the president(paragraph 3 sentance 1). So i belive that electoral college should be at most the most effecient way of electing a president because they have to persude the electorates to be on their side in order to get elected. Wich is much harder to do that pursudeing the people there for giving us a good honest president than one that will lie or try to hurt the public in any way because, i belive if their are officials going to vote for our nations president they will be much more careful of their decision,putting our nation in better hands.

source 3: in defenceof the electoral collage:five reasons to keep our method of choosing the president by Richard A. Posner reason 1:

Certainty Of  Outcome

Dispute over  the out come is possible-it happend in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute between popular vote. the reson is that winnning candidate's share of electoral collage invariably exeeds his share of the popular vote.

reason 2

:

Everyone's President

The electoral college  requirs canadates to have trans-regional appeal. no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional such as Mitt Romneywas in the south,has so innocently favored for he gain electoral vote by increasing his plurality in those states and if done he know he'll win.

reason 3

:

Swing States

The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces  the canidates-as we saw in [2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Voters in toss up states are more likeley to pay close attention to the campeign to really listen to the competeing canidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likeley to be on the most thoughtful votes, on average(and futher reason they will have recived the most information and attention from the canidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the one to decide the election.

reason 4

:

Big States

The electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionmentof the senate decreed in the constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida [2012] never the less obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in woyming would net the winner got 3 electoral votes.

reason 5

:

Avoid Run-Off Elections

The electoral college avoids run-off elections wich no canindate recives a majority of the votes cast. For example , Nixion in 1968 and Clinton both had only 43% plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college. There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure,wichwould greatly complicate the presidential election processes.

So you see that is is easier and less complex to do an electoral vote instead of a popular vote. Thats why i think it is manditory that we keep the electoral collage because it is a more orginized system that prevents some of the problems we see today.",0
"People ask for advice every day. Advice has a very big impact, especially for people who are young. People dont just only ask or talk to one person when seeking for advice, they ask multiple people. The more people that give you advice, the more successful you will become in life and if you are going to do something that has a negative outcome, multiple people can change your mind.

Getting advice from multiple people can help you in life. Every person has different beliefs and views to everything and it can be very helpful at times. Someones advice can stick with you throughout your entire life and help you when you are in a tough spot. There could also be some misleading advice. For example if someone gives a piece of advice that you truly believe has a negative outcome, do not use it.

If you are going to do something that has a negative outcome, someones advice can stop you from doing it. Some advice makes you rethink a situation and change the outcome. If you think a situation is bad and you ask someone advice, it can be very helpful. If you think someone is in a bad situation, you give them some advice too. If you give someone your advice they will be very thankful and might do the right thing.

In conclusion advice is beneficial. If someone gives you advice, you should cherish it. Advice can come from anyone, not just people you know. Advice goes a long way and it has a great impact on people. There is a also bad advice and you need to watch out for too.

Advice makes a person more successful and helps them not do negative actions towards themselves or others.",0
"In my point of view I agree with the following statement that, in twenty years ther will be a fewer cars which will come in use than there are today.

In your opinion, is this statement true or false? This statement is true in the sense that the number of cars will decrease over the next 20 years. However, it is also true that in that same period of time, people will continue to use more and more cars than they do now.",1
"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it can provide different perspectives and insights that one person may not have thought of. When people ask for advice, they are often looking for guidance or validation on a decision they are considering. By talking to more than one person, they can gather a variety of opinions and weigh the pros and cons of each option.

For example, if someone is trying to decide which college to attend, they may talk to their guidance counselor, a teacher, and a family member. Each person may have a different opinion based on their own experiences or knowledge. The guidance counselor may provide information on the academic programs and resources available at each college, the teacher may offer insight into the college's reputation and culture, and the family member may share personal stories or advice based on their own college experience.

By considering all of these opinions, the person can make a more informed decision that takes into account a variety of factors. They may also feel more confident in their choice, knowing that they have explored different options and considered multiple perspectives.

In addition, seeking multiple opinions can also help someone avoid making a hasty or impulsive decision. By taking the time to talk to different people and gather information, they can ensure that they are making a thoughtful and well-informed choice.

Overall, seeking multiple opinions can be a valuable tool in decision-making, as it can provide a more comprehensive and diverse perspective on a situation.",1
"There is nothing more satisfying than a leisurely afternoon spent in the garden. Gardening can be a truly rewarding experience, providing both physical and mental benefits to those who take part. It is an activity that has been practiced by people all over the world for centuries, allowing them to reap its many rewards. One of the most obvious advantages of gardening is the physical exercise it provides for those who partake in it. From digging holes for new plants to weeding and watering existing ones, every aspect of gardening requires some degree of movement from its participant. This makes gardening a great way to stay active throughout the summer months when spending time outdoors becomes especially enjoyable. The physical exertion also helps with muscle development and overall endurance; so not only does it provide pleasure from being outside, but also physically strengthens one's body as well!. The second significant benefit associated with gardening comes in terms of stress relief and mental wellbeing. Many studies have shown that spending time outdoors lowers cortisol levels (the hormone responsible for feelings of stress) while simultaneously increasing endorphin production (the hormones responsible for feeling contentment). Thus—not only does taking care of your garden help you stay fit but can also improve moods due to these positive effects on hormones levels! Additionally, engaging with nature lends itself towards instilling a sense of calmness that encourages relaxation amidst everyday life’s hustle-and-bustle; this is especially true if one’s chosen project involves something like flower planting or tending to vegetables which require attentive growth monitoring over multiple days or weeks at a time—a task which helps promote mindfulness amongst hobbyists all around the globe!. Lastly—gardening may even yield financial gains depending on how much effort put into it: cultivating high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables could potentially result in extra cash income if sold through local farmers markets or other similar outlets available close by; similarly raising flowers could lead towards creating extra sources for income too since",1
"In today's world, technology is becoming more and more important. Smartphones are everywhere and it has become an integral part of our lives. While advancements in this field have made various tasks easier, they have also raised a few concerns regarding privacy. Smartphone usage can open up individuals to unwanted security breaches which can put personal information at risk. Despite having the capability to store a large amount of data, small devices like cell phones remain vulnerable to several types of attacks from malicious actors such as hackers, who aim to gain access to confidential information for their own gain or even for political reasons. In order for users to protect themselves against these potential threats, it is essential that people learn the basics of how smartphone security works and how best to secure their phones properly in order minimize any risks associated with them. The first step in protecting smartphones against malicious activities starts with understanding the different types of threats out there including malware, phishing emails and software vulnerabilities which could be used by attackers to infiltrate systems and steal data stored on mobile devices without permission or knowledge from the user. It helps if users choose strong passwords when setting up their accounts on their phones as well as enable two-factor authentication where available. Furthermore, one should disable automatic connection settings whenever possible since this allows attackers easy access into networks without authorization or consent by tapping into wireless signals sent wirelessly through routers or other connected devices nearby; enabling firewalls will help mitigate such attempts too since they serve as additional protective layers between your device’s network traffic and keep unauthorized intruders away from accessing sensitive information stored within those networks . Aside from technical measures taken by users there are several basic steps people should take like exercising caution while using public Wi-Fi hotspots - these may not be secure enough due limited encryption methods employed while being passed through multiple computers along its route (so hackers could theoretically intercept transmitted data). Also keeping apps updated regularly is important because manufacturers release patches frequently so as stay ahead",1
"For some people having a car is a neccesity, but for others it can just be stressful. I believe it is much safer with out cars. There would be less accidents ,

less pollution and it would save people a lot of money .

In Paris they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the smog. If there were drivers out on the road they got fined. This didnt stop everyone, there was counts of 4,000 people being fined for driving. Just five days after the partial ban congestion went down 60 percent.

Just Imagine if five days of no driving caused congestion to go down 60 percent, how much would it go down if cars were eleminated all together.

There are some disadvantages to not having a car. Such as not being able to get where you need to go on time, biking or walking far places, getting sweaty before work or school ect.

Driving can also be very stressful, for example when businessman Carlos said It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,. This statement suggest that it is stressful to drive a car.

In conclusion, I would definitally want to have a car so i could get where i needed to go on time. I would also like to reserve the car only if i really needed to use it.",0
"There is no denying that education is a life-long process. No matter how much formal education one obtains, there is always more to learn. This is because the world is constantly changing and evolving, and we need to continuously adapt and update our knowledge in order to keep up. In addition, as we go through life, we gain new experiences and perspectives that can help us to better understand the world and ourselves.

That said, there are also some people who believe that formal education is not necessarily a life-long process. They may argue that once you have obtained a certain level of education, you no longer need to continue learning. This may be true in some cases, but it is not always the case. For example, if you are in a field that is constantly changing, such as technology, it is important to keep up with the latest developments. Otherwise, you may quickly become outdated and obsolete.

"Today's technology has changed the way we live.

One of the biggest changes in the last decade has been the use of cell phones.

The average person uses their cell phone at least 25 times per day.

This includes many different types of use.

We use phones for things today that just 3 years ago required a computer.

With this new world of wander, comes some disadvantages as well as dangers.

One of the most common dangers of cell phones is use while operating a vehicle.

Many states have laws in place to limit or even eliminate usage at all while driving.

There are many people that think making a law where you can't use your cell phone in a car at all is unnecessary. I find that to be a logical stand point for many reasons.

There is an argument for either side.

I, personally, feel that the government should not interfere with such decisions. However, I do realize the argument in favor of these type laws for safety reasons.

With today's technology, there are many more uses for a cell phone besides just making a phone call.

One of those uses is for navigation. This is a very helpful technology advancement that is used by millions of people every day. Many vehicles are now equipped with bluetooth technology which allows a cell phone to communicate through your car.

I think that using this option is a safe way to use a cell while driving.

As I mentioned earlier, the use of cell phones while driving can be a safety issue.

I do realize that there have been multiple accidents, some fatal, due to the use of a phone while driving.

I agree that distracted driving puts everyone on the road at an increased risk for accident. With the use of bluetooth and similar advances, you can do many things on a cell phone without even touching the phone.

For example, I can use voice to text or voice dial options to communicate with others while I am driving.

This is a safer option that always allows me to have both hands on the wheel.

I do think that my generation is a little too addicted to their phones.

An addiction to anything can become a problem.

I also think that having laws such as limited or zero tolerance of cell phone usage while driving can create an even bigger problem.

Before it was a law in GA, I feel that I was a safer driver, even when using my phone.

After the law went in force, I still use my phone sometimes while I am driving.

I now just try to hide it.

This creates an even bigger safety issue for me.

I will probably always have a cell phone with me.

I do try and limit my usage while I am driving now more than I did before GA passed the current no usage law.

However, as I've said above, I don't feel like this is something that government should be involved in.

I think if you are a safe driver then you will know when it is ok to use your phone and when it isn't.

I understand that I am still a young driver and if I were older my opinion might be different.

There are good and bad sides of most laws and I don't think this one is any different.",0
"While Exploring Venus Poses Significant Challenges, Its Study Remains an Important Scientific Endeavor

The author of The Challenge of Exploring Venus makes a compelling case that investigating Venus, despite the planet's extreme environmental hazards, is worthwhile for advancing scientific understanding. Several key pieces of evidence in the article bolster this perspective. 

To begin, the author notes Venus' similarities to Earth in terms of size, mass, and composition, suggesting it may hold clues about the evolution of terrestrial planets generally. Given Earth's prominence as the only world we know to support life, Venus could provide comparative insights into how conditions became suitable for life here versus its apparently inhospitable neighbor. Additionally, the article discusses Venus' unique atmospheric chemistry, with a predominance of greenhouse gases creating a runaway greenhouse effect and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Untangling the precise mechanisms that led to this divergence from Earth's climate trajectory would be a significant scientific achievement with relevance for modeling climate change.

Perhaps most compelling is the evidence that Venus may have possessed liquid water on its surface in the past. If proven, this would dramatically alter perceptions of Venus as eternally dry and bleak. It could also shed light on why and how Venus transitioned from a potentially habitable world to the boiling hellscape it is today. Such discoveries would meaningfully advance scientific understanding of planetary evolution and habitability.   

 While exploring Venus undoubtedly poses hazards its hostile environment presents, with care and ingenuity humans have braved other inhospitable places to reap scientific rewards. The potential insights to be gained from Venus, as outlined effectively by the author, make overcoming its challenges well worth the effort. Planetary science stands to benefit immensely from comparative planetology on Earth's mysterious twin. In conclusion, the author presents a strong case that studying Venus, despite inherent risks, remains an important and justified pursuit that could yield profound scientific discoveries.",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of its continuation. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the information provided in various texts, including What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, and In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner. Based on the evidence presented in these texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept rather than changing to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it provides certainty of outcome. According to Judge Posner, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely to occur compared to disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. As demonstrated in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote, even though he only received 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Governor Romney. This illustrates that the Electoral College ensures a clear winner, reducing the chances of prolonged disputes and uncertainty.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having everyone's president. Judge Posner argues that the system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, encouraging candidates to campaign across the entire nation. This is vital for the success of a president, as a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to effectively represent the interests of all citizens. By requiring candidates to consider the concerns and needs of various regions, the Electoral College helps to ensure a president who is attentive to the diverse interests of the nation.

The focus on swing states is another compelling aspect of the Electoral College. Plumer highlights that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes motivates candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on toss-up states. In doing so, the candidates are more likely to engage with voters in these states and work towards earning their support. This, in turn, encourages voters in toss-up states to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. By emphasizing the importance of these states, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged voters have a significant say in determining the outcome of the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large states. Judge Posner notes that the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution created a situation where large states have relatively less political weight. However, the Electoral College gives large states more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This balance is crucial, as it prevents a scenario where candidates exclusively cater to the interests of small states while neglecting the concerns of larger states. The Electoral College allows for a fair distribution of attention and consideration, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of the nation's needs.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the complications of run-off elections. Judge Posner points out that when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, pressure for run-off elections arises. However, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, reducing the need for additional elections and the associated logistical challenges. This ensures a more efficient and streamlined process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be retained due to the certainty of outcome it provides, its ability to produce a president who represents all regions of the country, the emphasis it places on swing states and thoughtful voter engagement, the balanced attention it gives to large states, and its avoidance of run-off elections. While there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers practical advantages that help create a fair and effective presidential election process.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College and to consider these key points when evaluating potential changes to the current system.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Though there is no one activity that can provide every benefit, the outdoors offer a variety of activities that can be tailored to suit any individual's lifestyle and health goals. Activities such as biking, running, swimming, and hiking have numerous benefits that range from lower stress levels to providing a full-body workout. Even something as simple as taking a walk or going for a picnic can help improve mental health and foster a sense of connection with nature. 

Additionally, spending time outdoors provides opportunities to connect with family, friends, and potential new acquaintances. Setting a plan for people to get fit while enjoying the outdoors doesn't have to be limited to exercise. Consider also creating opportunities to help those in need, such as donating old outdoor gear or participating in a park clean-up. Being outdoors doesn't have to be boring. With the right planning, it can be a fun and rewarding multi-faceted experience.",1
"Do you think Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers? I think it can worth it because it is one of the planets that is close to us (Earth). Venus is sometimes called Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. The things I will get to tell you will explode your mind about Venus.

First, Venus is very dangerous to visit. For example, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus`s atmosphere.

In fact, scientists are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ao, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can sometimes be our neaarest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.

Finally, NASA is working on other approchaes to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus`s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II. These calcualtions by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

In conclusion, these are all the details on how Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They have a lot of factors that makes it so much fun to learn despite it`s danger. Scientist will find a way to reach Venus and study it for years to come. Would you ever study Venus after reading this?",0
"Phones and Driving

Texting and driving is never okay but that doesn't mean that phones should never be used while driving. There are beneficial uses of cellphones that allow drivers to get to their destination is a faster, happier way. Technology keeps advancing and is even included in newer cars or other vehicles. Not everyone has, or can afford a new car though. This means that they must rely on their phone for music, GPS, and emergency phone calls.

Music can be a big deal for drivers because in certain kinds of situations such as long drives. Long, extended drives causes drivers to not be able to focus on where they're supposed to be going, also called highway hypnosis. Music allows drivers to focus better and keep them attentive. It also keeps drivers in a good mood which causes less stress and road rage.

GPS is the most necessary reason for using a phone when the car doesn't have that kind of technology. GPS is safer than writing down directions or using a map. The driver doesn't have to look down at the phone either because most GPS services have a voice speaking out directions for them.

Sometimes drivers have absolute emergency phone calls that they must take. They don't have to put their phone up to their ear since there are other ways around it. Drivers could use the speaker option on their phone or Bluetooth. An emergency call could include calling the police for reckless drivers or crashes. Personal emergency calls include a wife going into labor or needing to take a detour to pick kids up from school.

Drivers should never text and drive, however there are still plausible uses for phones such as getting directions from GPS, listening to music as entertainment, and emergency phone calls for various reasons. Most reasons for phones are unnecessary especially with the technology provided in newer cars. If the driver has a car that has everything available, then their phone is not needed in their presence.

"I often hear people say that education is a lifelong process. While this is undoubtedly true in some cases, it is not always the case. There are many people who believe that education can be completed in a short amount of time. This is because education is a process that is meant to help people learn and grow.

One reason that education can be completed in a short amount of time is because it is a life-long process. Education is meant to help people develop their skills and knowledge. This is because people learn best when they are in a environment that is supportive and positive. It is also important to note that education is not a one-time event. People are often required to attend school for a variety of reasons, such as for their children or for their careers.

"The advancement of technology has helped humanity a lot in several ways, such as comuters,phones or even, planes to travel the world. These advancements could help students to learn in school. The facial recognition mentioned in this article is amazing for the following reasons: it could give students an easier time understanding material, it could introduce new ideas into peoples minds about career oppurtunities, and it could draw students focus into their work.

This facial recognition could help students understand their material better by molding the lesson if the student is confused or bored or possible even distracted. This would be immensely helpful for students who may have trouble comprehending certain subjects like math or English. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson,like an effective humn instructor.

By shaping the lesson around the student it makes it more possible for a student to pass a class and graduate from highschool or college. If the student seems confused the lesson can slow down and work through the problem with them. If the student seems happy then the lesson can speed up and throw harder work at them.

Technology such as facial recognition in an acedemic situation could take the slowing down of harder classes and us that to drive new ideas of new technology into peoples heads. These programs could take calculus and make it to appleal to students with a mind for working with computers. This would open job oppurtunities for millions of people in the United States alone. It could take biology and slow the lesson to then advance it into so many different branches of biology.

Students get distracted; it's a thing that happens. what if it wasn't as easy to be distracted. what if your lesson shaped itsel ito something you liked because you undersood it, because you could make sense of what the lesson was about, and pllied it to real world situations. A lot of the reasons students get distracted is because they dont understand their subject or it's too hard so they stop to take abreak and dont come back to it baecause they know that they'll be just as confused when they come back to it as they were when they left. If your lesson slows down to incorporate your confused look or your stares of boredom it could mke the lesson easier to help you understand it which will in turn capture your attention again. I know multiple people who would love to have tis tech, myself included.

This would be an amazing advancemement in the acedemic worl but it's very far off. When this becomes widespread it would boost the economy of its country by a lot. I believe this technology would be beneficial for the following reasons: it would help students undertsand their material, it could introduce new ideas into peoples minds about career oppurtunities, and it could draw students focus into their work.",0
"Living in a small town has its pros and cons, but for the most part it can be quite enjoyable. Growing up in a rural community offers unique opportunities that those living in larger cities may not experience. Of course there are downsides to life away from the hustle and bustle of city life, but there is something special about living together as one unified force where everyone looks out for each other’s best interests. One of the biggest advantages of living in a small town is a sense of closeness amongst neighbors. People know each other by name, which leads to stronger relationships between locals than one might find elsewhere. With smaller populations and fewer people coming into contact with each other daily, it allows time to build strong bonds based on mutual understanding and respect that would otherwise not have been formed if more people were around competing for attention or resources. This tight-knit atmosphere also spreads to local businesses; restaurants, stores, bars all form individual personalities due to their close proximity with customers - owners tend to really get know them well over time!. Furthermore, another benefit provided by rural areas lies within its natural beauty - fields expanses provide stunning views that are rarely seen anywhere else! Wildlife also flourishes here as ecosystems remain relatively untouched compared to suburban/urban settings where development alters habitats significantly; this means birdwatchers or outdoor enthusiasts can observe creatures in their undisturbed habitat without having human intervention impede upon the viewing experience!. Additionally, air quality tends be much cleaner since few factories exist (if any) thus reducing potential pollution sources drastically when compared against bigger cities who need industrial sites for production purposes – this helps maintain an environmentally friendly atmosphere both indoors & outdoors alike!. . . . Finally yet importantly enough – although at times entertainment options may seem limited relative others places (as they often rely on slow connections/internet access), these restrictions slightly push creativity further as activities revolve around family gatherings or group excursions instead of electronic devices such as video games",1
"On the one hand, young people tend to have more energy and enthusiasm, which can make them more inclined to enjoy life. They have fewer responsibilities and obligations than older adults, so they have more time to explore their interests and hobbies, travel, and socialize with friends. Additionally, young people are generally healthier, which allows them to participate in physical activities and adventures without hindrances.

Moreover, young people are often more optimistic and hopeful about the future. They might not have achieved their dreams yet, but they believe that anything is possible and that their potential is limitless. This positive mindset can make even the mundane aspects of life seem exciting and full of opportunities.

On the other hand, older people may have a different perspective on life that allows them to enjoy it just as much or even more than young people. For example, they may have more wisdom and experience, which can help them appreciate the simple pleasures in life such as spending time with loved ones or enjoying a quiet moment alone. They may have also achieved significant accomplishments in their lives, such as advancing in their careers, raising a family, or traveling the world. These achievements can bring a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that can enhance one's enjoyment of life.

Furthermore, older people may have fewer distractions and more freedom to pursue their interests without worrying about external pressures. They may have retired from their jobs, so they have more free time to pursue hobbies, volunteer, or travel. Additionally, they may have a more stable financial situation, which allows them to indulge in experiences that they could not afford when they were younger.

In conclusion, whether young people enjoy life more than older people is subjective and depends on an individual's perspective and circumstances. While young people may have more energy and enthusiasm, older people may have more wisdom and experience, which can help them appreciate life just as much or even more. Ultimately, the key to enjoying life is to find joy in the present moment, stay positive, and pursue one's interests and passions.",1
"Dear senator, the Electoral College has always been a good way to elect our leaders, and it is the best way to do it. It has the ability to use swing states for better voting, larger and smaller states get different amounts of electoral votes, and presidents cannot be elected by a region alone.

The effect of having swing states because of the Electoral College is a positive one because when a state feels like they have a chance of having their candidate win, they put more thought into the vote they cast knowing that their vote counts. Having voters put more thought into their votes instead of not caring as much gives the better candidate a greater chance of winning, if one candidate was truly better than the other. The more thoughtfull candidates in a swing state will pull more information from the candidates campaigns. Popular vote does not use the winner takes all method so the idea of swing states will no longer have any effect in the election.

Another great reason why the Electoral College is better than popular vote is because depending on the size of the states a certain amount of votes is given to the electors. Larger states get more attention from presidential candidates because of the majority vote in the particular state. if there was only popular vote then presidential candidates could waste their time on smaller states when they could of been winning larger states. The varying amount of electoral votes for each state depending on its size also allows for a more equal and fair election, due to the less populated states not being able to have more electoral votes then the more populated states.

The Electoral College allows that presidential candidates cannot win the election by regional appeal. This means that if a particular region favors a candidate they cannot win by only a single regions votes. This makes the candidates campaign less in regions that are more likely to be won and more in other regions. But with the Electoral College this makes it harder for a candidate with only regional appeal to win because other regions feel like their votes will not be as effective towards the election. With popular vote a presidential candidate will not know where to campaign and where not because there is no winner take all method.

This is why I belive that having the Electoral College is superior to popular vote when we the people vote for presidential candidates.",0
"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we abolish the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter.",0
"Honesty is essential in everyday life; it’s the foundation of any healthy relationship - be that with your family, friends, or colleagues. Honesty is an important factor in gaining trust from others as it shows that you are trustworthy and reliable. Trying to cover up lies can be damaging to relationships, as it erodes trust and can cause considerable distress. 

Many situations demonstrate when honesty is the best policy. For example, if you make a mistake at work, it’s best to own up to it instead of trying to pass the blame. Being honest about your shortcomings demonstrates integrity and a sense of responsibility. It also shows that you are accountable for your actions and is far more likely to be viewed positively by colleagues than trying to save face. 

Of course, there can be serious consequences of lying. Breaching somebody’s trust can hurt them and can take a long time to repair after an act of dishonesty. If you are caught lying, even once, it will be incredibly difficult to regain someone’s faith in you and the truth going forward. Ultimately, honesty is the best path to ensure relationships are built on trust.",1
"People sometimes ask more than one person for advice on hard decisions. How can asking multiple people for advice help someone make the right choice? I think getting advice from more than one person is helpful because they'll have different peoples opinions.

Receiving more advice is very useful, because one person could of been in the same situation your in and the other person could just know the right thing to do. The person that has been in the situation before could have did the wrong, and messed up something then you seek ideas that they give you to do the right. On the other hand the person such as your parent gives you advice knows more than the person you asked before because they been on the earth longer and seen bad things happen. Advice from multiple people is useful to put all their ideas, and or opinions together to make your own good decision.

Seeking advice from all different basketball coaches, and trainers is very good because they'll have lots of their own opinions. Generic_Name from Generic_School could tell you, Need to work on moving without the ball, but your high school coach tells you that You need to work on, on the ball defense. One trainer could say You got to work on your jump shot off the dribble a little more, but another trainer says Your jump shot is fine, but you have to improve your handles. Trainers can give you ideas on what college you choose to go to when the decision comes down to that.

People ask for more than one person for advice why do people do that? I think that's a good idea to do because you learn from people. Won't make the same mistakes that they have did. People can tell different stuff you need to work on if it's sports, school, or being yourself. All advice is good.",0
"I'm going to talk now about a such interesting articte called Making Mona Lisa Smile.

This article talks about how a new type of technology for the computers called Facial Action Coding System is able to calculate your facial expressions and know how do you feel in that exact moment; sad, happy, surprised, angry... The author show an example about the Mona Lisa of her facial expressions, and that was de result of it:

She's 63 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. The process for this new system begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face with all 44 major muscles. Every time those muscles moves create a new expression in your face, and depend of the movements of your muscles you will have one emotion or another that the computer will detect.

I think that is an a good idea but it doesn't convince me at all. Dr. Huang say  A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, and Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, my opinion for this is that when you are at the school and you are reading something that it looks interesting for you and makes you happy, you will not be smiling at the screen of the computer, you will just be enjoying yourself about what are you reading. So if my muscles are not expressing any emotion the computer will probably detect that I'm bored and it will change what I'm reading. And for this reason I think that woul be a problem in more than just one situation.

I did like this articte but I didnt simle when I was reading it, so my conclusion is that I don't think that a computer will be able to calculate your emotions looking the muscles of your face.",0
"I say no becuase you cannot jude somonw by there first impressions has a person. It would be nice getting to know the person and if their imature its fine from first impressions. Getting to know who the person is by askin them about them self not just be like of there not good enough. For a example if someone is tired and your gunna be like oh their lazy you cant just base them from there firsr impresstions.

Is it impossible to change no its not impposble because it i ur mentality. In life nothing is inpossible you can easily chnage to a whole diffrent lets say, your a very mean person you can always change and be super nice to everyone. You can always change for who you are and for me i was very quiet i would never wanna go talk to poeple because i was really shy with people but now i like to talking to everyone else and i dont care who the person is i always introduce my self.

So i strongly agree with this statement you cannot jude someone by their first impressions some people thought i was really mean when they first met me bcause i would be tired end of the day and i wouldnt walk people because i was lazy and i didnt have that enery to talk. Thats why i changed my mentality so people would not call me lazy because its anoying so thats why i changed my whole life around i didnt wanna be so the same so i just changed, that made me super happy just for having a new life style.

When someone says it is impossible to change their wrong because they dont belive in them selfs that they can change has a new perosn i didnt think i was going to be a whole new diffrent person. and now i do really like who i am always smileing. Back then i would not like to smile i was a really boring person. I wont lie i have based poeple have their first impressions and be like dam there not cool people and end of the day they are cool people. So it is not good juding someone to fast so in my opion i say yes i stronlgy agree.

"Golf is an incredibly popular sport, and for good reason. The game combines physical skill with mental acuity to create a challenging yet rewarding experience for all players. Despite its reputation as a leisurely pursuit, golf can also be highly competitive, requiring strategy and finesse in order to achieve the best results. To truly excel at the game of golf requires dedication, practice, and patience—all great lessons that can be applied to life beyond the course. In terms of equipment needed to play golf, there are several items required before teeing off. A set of clubs is necessary; they vary in length and design depending on which type of shots you wish to execute successfully on the green. Ball markers should also be kept handy when playing rounds of golf—these are small discs placed behind your ball so that it does not disrupt other players’ swings when putting or chipping during a round. Additionally, tees are important components that ensure consistent angles when driving off from the tee box; these come in different sizes depending upon individual preference while playing out on the course itself. The number one rule while playing golf is etiquette: show respect for other players by allowing them their own space within their fairways as well being quiet during backswings or putts so as not to distract anyone’s focus on making accurate shots throughout each hole played on any given day at the club/course chosen for your recreational activities/matches - this includes refraining from littering after attempting chip-shots near water hazards or sand traps (bunkers) present beneath elevated greens located around some holes found throughout many courses worldwide – besides showing general sportsmanlike conduct towards others through words used while talking amongst yourself &/or fellow competitors alike prior & post rounds started too!. .

Although that may or may not be the mindset of many, people fail to realize there are other ways of reaching from point A to point B, without harming the environment and it's people. Limiting car usage not only benefits the person who is using the car, but their community and environment.

The use of a car isn't, at all, important in everyday use. Instead of using a car, which helps build up the problem of air pollution, one can simply walk, take a bike or even use public transportation. Just like Bogota, several countries should participate in a Carfree day. Spreading awareness, that a car isn't always needed to move around an area, can help to benefit the people and the environment. As said in source 3, The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, bringing awareness of more easy and effective public transportation,which can help to rid that particular country of the usage of cars. Once participants of this carfree day understand the effects they are having upon the air pollution, they would be much more willing to help with this process just like businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza, Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Overall the usage of cars doesn't benefit the environment. Sooner, rather than later, it is important that we realize this problem and fix it before it's too late for our community.

Not only is the usage of a car terrible for our environment, it is also not needed as how it was. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005, during this time, many vehicles were purchased with a high demand and were considered to be popular, although that isn't the case anymore. As years went past, the number of miles began to drop steadily. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars, that may be the case for some, but for others they didnt feel it was necessary to own one. In German Suburbs, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway, providing this area with no need for a car. Since everything was so near, a car was a waste of thought. If they did own cars, they would have to pay for both the car and a means of where to park the car. Those expensies were usually 40,000, along with a home, much more money than a free walk to any of your local stores. With the hopes of limiting the usage of cars, comes the need for expanding Vaubanlike suburbs. With that being said, according to the article, these suburbs need to be expanded not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are chocking cities.

To sum it up, the limiting of cars is becoming important in the development of the new world and the fixation of the old. As of now, cars consist of having no benefit for the environment and of certain communities. As days go on and more people become aware of the means of public transportation, hopefully there won't need to be any cars. To take action in this plan, more Vaubanlike suburbs need to be put in place to give off the same react. Although some people understand the full effect of a car on the environment, it is critial that nearly every person understands. Cars, as of today's age, aren't benefiting the public as how they used to.",0
"As stated in the article, the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors, where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. A state's entitled number of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional Delegation. There is one for each member in the House of Representatives, and two for every Senator. There are many reasons why the voting process should be changed to popular vote instead of the Electoral College. The two biggest reasons are as follows: Unfair elections and the freedom of the people.

As stated in the third source, the Electoral College is often considered an anachonism and is unliked across the nation. The reasons for which vary greatly from certainty of outcome to big states to swing states. Certainty of outcome means that one of the Presidential Candidates has to be chosen to become President. There are no recounts in Electoral College, whoever they like the most becomes President, and that ins't fair to the people. Bigger states tend to have more members in the electoral college. This can greatly influence an election if a big state like Texas favors one candidate over the other. Swing states are the states that receive more attention than other states due to bias, greatly influencing votes. In my opinion, this is something that needs to be changed.

Citizens of the United States of America are the ones who are supposed to decide who should be the President of the United States of America. It isn't right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are outweighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States they shouldn't. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.

I hope that the voting process will change. I hope that it will finally become fair. That it will become what the people want it to be. It should be what the people want it to be. We the people of the United States have the power to change this, and we should work to change it. The voting process should no longer be the Electoral College but should be dicided by the people and only the people. The voting process needs to be fair and needs to be what the people want it to be.",0
"The Electoral College is broken, and with another election on the way, here is why the voting should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Voters cannot control whom their electors are, in the chance that those electors are replaced with new electors so the votes may be rigged, as well as faithless electors may refuse to vote for their party's candidate and could cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Voters don't actually vote for the president, instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. In the case that you vote John Kerry in Texas, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it's the state's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citizens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn't be.

In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. because each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming. This cannot represent the will of the people.

Now when have you changed your mind about something? Electors can do the same. Electors can refuse to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please. That can't be right, yet it has happened plenty of times before. It's even unfair to the people, who sometimes don't even get to see their electors. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, they don't focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards swing states. In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see their candidates at all, as well as 25 of the largest media markets who didn't get to see not one campaign ad.

The Electoral College dosen't hear the voice of the people, hardly plays by the rules, is something that should be erased. Even people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dale, the U.S.",0

"In a world filled with expectations, it can be difficult to remain true to oneself. The struggles of being yourself can often be compounded for immigrant populations, teenagers, and those who are considered ‘different’. For example, immigrant families often have to deal with different cultures, expectations, and norms, which can make it hard for them to stay true to their identity and beliefs. Teenagers, in particular, frequently have to face peer pressure to conform to certain standards and ideals, which again can make it difficult to be their authentic selves. And those who are seen as ‘different’ – whether because of their personal preferences, physical appearance, or anything else – often have to battle against negative stereotypes in order to remain true to themselves.

Despite these difficulties, however, it is possible to be yourself, even in difficult situations. For example, it can be beneficial to surround oneself with people who can support, encourage and motivate you to be your true self, free from judgement. It can also be beneficial to identify and nurture your passions and engage in meaningful activities. Through these means, it is possible to stick to your values and be your true self in spite of any pressure to conform. 

Indeed, ‘being yourself’ in less than ideal conditions can be the ‘greatest accomplishment’ of all. By remaining true to your authentic self, you can stay confident and maintain your integrity, even when facing adversity. It is a difficult but ultimately rewarding feat, one which is worthy of celebration and acknowledgement.",1
"Successful people in the history became famous and successful because they invented new things or they found out something that no one knew. For example, Leonardo da Vinci invented the printing press, Thomas Edison invented light bulbs, and Albert Einstein discovered the theory of relativity. In other words, successful people are not only successful in their field of expertise, but they are also able to think outside of their comfort zone and find new ways of doing things.

What do you think is the most important thing you have learned in your life? I learned that you can't always get what you want. You have to be willing to work hard to achieve your goals.",1
"The new technology theses people are wotking on is an outstanding acheivment and will help to improve our education. This technology could be very useful in other situations that require the information this technology can give. Technology of this type is something that could change the way we do certain things in life.

Facial Action Coding System can be very useful in our education system today. In this age we have a good education system but can be improved in so many ways. The FACS can see what we feel by looking atr our faces, so that would allow the student to have a different lesson whether it be more or less difficult to allow him/her to learn at a much better pace than previously. The article states that the FACS can set up a new lesson for the student who is either bored or stressed, this only proves my point further that it would be of great value for our education system today.

The FACS system can be introduced to many lines of work other than our education system. In confrences with people with problems in their live a certain word can trigger an emotion, the FACS system would be able to tell his/her emotion and properly calm him/her down. The FACS system is and amazing feat and even become a great asset to interrogation such as whether or not using fear on a person actually works or if the interrigated person is lying about their emotion.

FACS is a wonderful technological invention that could change many things in our day to day life. This system can help jobs become easier and could very well reduce the amount of suicides by helping people get the help they need. The FACS can make our life so much better and could be effective on therapy and other jobs in that line of work.

Overall the FACS system is revolutionary and we should adopt it into our lives. With the FACS system our lives could change for the better and allow a new dawn to begin. Once the FACS system is in our lives it can be updated on the way we hide our emotions and keep up with the different tactics of concealment and deception to allow a more perfect system made out of the origional. FACS is truly and outstanding acheivment that must be used in our lives.",0
"There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to how children should be taught to compete and cooperate. Ultimately, it is up to the parents or guardians to decide what is best for their children. Some people believe that children should learn to compete, as this will help them to become more independent and self-reliant. Others believe that children should be taught to cooperate, as this will help them to build relationships and cooperate with others.

Some reasons why children should learn to compete are that it can help them to become more self-reliant and independent. They will learn to rely on themselves, and not let other people or things control them. They will also learn to be competitive and work hard in order to win.

Some reasons why children should learn to cooperate are that it can help them to build relationships and friendships. They will learn to work together as a team, and to trust and respect each other. They will also learn to be patient and take things slow, which can be important in later life.",1
"One of the primary arguments for implementing a four-day school week is the potential cost savings. Many schools are currently operating at a budget deficit and a four-day week could help those districts by reducing the amount of money spent on utilities, staff, and transportation. Additionally, students would also be provided with an extended weekend, reducing the amount of stress they experience during the week. 

However, there are several potential drawbacks as well. For instance, students may struggle to stay motivated and focused with the extra day off. Furthermore, a four-day school week may also increase the likelihood of teachers needing to miss class and disrupt lesson plans. Additionally, it may be difficult to plan certain events such as field trips, sports games, and Parent-Teacher Conferences. 

Ultimately, while a four-day school week may have some benefits, a thorough assessment of both the advantages and disadvantages must be taken into consideration before implementing it at a school. It is important to weigh both the potential cost savings and the potential negative effects of such a schedule in order to make an informed decision.",1
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Which shouldn't be allowed while driving because you could cause serious matters for you and everyone surrounding you. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. The feeling is that young drivers find it enough of a challenge to operate a car, and that any distractions are dangerous. The punishment you get for using a hand-held phone while driving is commensurate with how dangerous that behaviour. A part of the problem is people may answer an email or text they consider to be urgent while driving and because they don't have an accident, they think it's safe to do again. Ways to prevent this from happening; Put your phone away while driving. Putting your phone on mute or turning your phone off entirely is a sure-fire way you to avoid being distracted by it while you're driving. Have a conversation with people in your car or on the phone (even hands-free).To break these habits, people can either turn off their phone or put it on silent before driving. This will force them to concentrate on the road only. But if this method doesn't work on some people, you can use Siri to command your phone to read your messages or to reply back. Texting is a major factor when it comes to crashes and creating a hazardous situation, so preventing the usage of cell phones while driving would be a large step in limiting the number of crashes that happen in the United States. There are multiple associations that are already trying to prevent cell phone usage.",0
"I generally agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. One reason is that advertisements often use exaggerated or unrealistic images to sell their products. For example, an advertisement for a new car might show a model driving down a highway at high speeds, while another advertisement for a new phone might show a model using the phone to take a selfie in a beautiful setting.

Another reason advertisements make products seem better is that they often focus on the features of the product rather than the drawbacks. For example, an advertisement for a new phone might focus on the features that make the phone unique, such as it's camera or it's battery life. However, the advertisement might not mention the fact that the phone has a high price tag or that it is difficult to use.

Overall, I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, I also believe that advertisements can be helpful in informing consumers about new products that they may be interested in.",1
"Humans have always been seen as superior to machines; however, the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence has led to debate on whether machines have surpassed or will eventually surpass human minds. I disagree with the statement that the human mind will always be superior to machines. Machines have already surpassed us in many aspects, and there is no doubt that they will continue to do so in the future.

To begin with, machines are capable of performing complex calculations at a much faster rate than humans. For example, computers can solve complex equations or algorithms almost instantaneously, while it would take humans a significantly longer amount of time to solve the same equation. Furthermore, machines are also able to store massive amounts of data without the need for any physical memory storage, as opposed to humans whose memories are limited. This means that machines are able to access and process information much more quickly and accurately than humans.

In addition, machines are also able to perform a wider variety of tasks than humans. For instance, robots are able to perform many mundane and repetitive tasks, such as assembly line work, that would be difficult for humans to do for long periods of time. Furthermore, machines are also able to perform dangerous or difficult tasks that humans would not be able to do, such as deep sea exploration or space exploration. 

Another aspect in which machines are able to surpass humans is decision making. Machines are able to analyze data and come to conclusions or decisions much faster than humans can. For instance, self-driving car technology is able to make decisions based on data from it's environment much faster than a human driver would be able to. This technology has been proven to be much safer than human drivers and is likely to become increasingly commonplace in the future.

Finally, machines are also becoming increasingly advanced in their ability to simulate human interaction and behavior. For example, artificial intelligence systems are able to simulate human conversations and interact with people much more naturally than was previously possible. These systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are now able to hold more complex conversations and even understand emotions. 

In conclusion, while the human mind is still superior to machines in certain aspects, the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning has allowed machines to surpass humans in many ways. They are able to perform complex calculations faster and more accurately, are able to perform more tasks, are more efficient at decision making, and are able to simulate human behavior and interaction. As machines become increasingly more sophisticated in the future, it is likely that they will surpass humans in even more aspects. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that the human mind will always be superior to machines.",1
"I believe it is a neat idea to have technology that can understand human emotion. But if we continue down this path of robotic contimplation I think we may have bigger issues. The idea of having a computer always monitor your emotional states seems almost like not giving methe privacy that i deserve. So that being said it would be a neat idea but I dont think it should be incorporated at schools but maybe as a voluntary thing that people can sign up for that would be different.

It's a bad idea because it would cause drama in peoples lives who dont need to have any more of it in them. Its almost a little creepy and rude. I mean if you really weren't having a good day and a computer told you that youre upset. I'm pretty sured you'd be more upset than you were because we as human dont like to be confronted with that type of stuff. I think that if it was a voluntary thing were peoplecould go and sign up to see how they feel because god forbid they dont know their own emotions it would be a good idea. But I think its a terrible idea to be doing on peple without consent.

It's a good idea because it could help slove murder cases if it can tell when people are lying. If it can tell if people are nervous that could be helpful for police interrogation. It can be used on the person who doesn't want to live and can tell that they are upset enough to do something like that and they can be stopped before it happens. It seems like it can be helpful if used by the Police but for the public it wouldnt be a good idea.

The ugly truth about it is the fact this may or may not be real but if it is it will happen. It will eventually happen and then the world will start buiding new things to make robots do and then they'll take over the world but until then. This is a retched idea. If this is to be a good idea I'd say let law enforcement have it but no public access. If we truly want to be supporting the peole who struggle with depression or anything we wont just make a robot tell them to get better. Nothing in this world beats human interaction when love is shown. If we all just showed a little more love idea like this wouldnt even be a thing.

Its not a good idea it never will be But, If it does happent you can bet that I will wear a mask everywhere I go. Personally I dont like the idea of a machine telling me what I am. And if the world come to it and they must have rbots that tell emotions I hope I'm long gone by then.",0
"I am writing this prompt to inform you about the position for hiring. I would be very delighted if I could be hired by you. I do not have experience at all but, I can show you that I am a good candidate for this job and I could handle the job very well. Here are some few reason why I would be a good candidate for the job.

One reason on why you should hire me is that even though I don't have experience I tend to learn really fast and do multiple things at a time. Usually I memorize them very easily. It has a greater impact on me because I learn fast and customers are more happy with the service. Also, I could do many things at a time which is good for the job and good for the customers.

For example, in some restaurants it takes long for someone to do your order or even get to your table to get your order. It is better if you have someone that is fast and shows that the customers are there number one priority. It is good that the customers feel welcomed and feel important when the workers are giving them attention.

Another reason is that I have an amazing, outstanding attitude with people. I am a very joyful person and what I feel like is right, is giving joyfulness to customers who need it. For example, I have friends that sometimes have had a rough day and I tend to help them and make them happier and change their perspective to a better one. I think it is good that if a restaurant has someone happy and joyful the customers would want to come in because its a very joyful place. My goal is always to see poeple smiling and keept encouraging them to always be happy.

The restaurant can always make more money when customers feel like its there home.

Lastly, I like meeting new people at jobs and working as a group. What I love to do is bringing everyone together and making new friendships.

I've seen that when working as a groups it is better because you get things done faster. You also make greter connections with your coworkers. For example, If someone needs something for a customer and your busy doing something else its better to ask a coworker to help you out. I like bringing bonds together and working with them.

These are some of the reason I would love to get the job. I want to learn something new thats not from my perspective. I love trying new things and getting to know the different types of jobs around the community. I also learn very fast and I love being commited to anything and working as a group. I hoppe you consider me to work there and I would be very happy. Thank you for your time.",0
"In his essay 'On Motion and Merit', Thomas Jefferson argues that we should embrace labor and constant movement in order to live our most fulfilling lives. He believes that it is excellence, rather than idleness or comfort that create true happiness. He states that incessant execution of labor is the only proof of our existence, and, as long as we are executing, we cease to be mere shadows, and become real and living things.” 

Jefferson's perspective can be applied to the world today by valuing effort and dedication. In the modern era, hard work is often a key factor in finding success and achieving individual goals. For example, when studying for a degree or preparing for a job interview, the amount of effort and dedication a person puts into their task will be reflected in the results. The same principle can be applied to any challenge; those who strive to excel and devote themselves to their tasks will be rewarded with greater satisfaction and personal growth.

In conclusion, Jefferson's views on constant work and motion can be applicable to the world today. While hard work and dedication may not always have an immediate reward, in the long run they enable us to lead more fulfilling lives and excel in whatever challenge we face.",1
"The internet has revolutionized the way that people learn about, shop for, and purchase everyday items. Online shopping in particular has become an increasingly popular choice among consumers of all ages over the past decade. While there are many advantages to online shopping, it also comes with certain risks and drawbacks which must be considered before making a purchase. One major advantage to online shopping is its convenience. With just a few clicks of the mouse, shoppers can browse through hundreds or even thousands of different products without having to leave their homes or offices. In addition, orders made using credit cards typically arrive much faster than those made with checks or money orders sent by mail. Many retailers offer special discounts on items ordered through their websites as well as free shipping deals when customers meet certain criteria set forth by the company itself. Furthermore, some retailers offer loyalty programs which give customers access to exclusive discounts and special offers only available on their sites; these savings are often substantial enough that they can easily make up for any inconveniences associated with ordering online rather than in-person at a local store location. Despite these considerable advantages though, there are still some potential risks associated with online shopping that should be taken into consideration beforehand. For one thing, since most purchases involve payment via credit card information entered directly onto a secure website server; this leaves buyers vulnerable to hacker attacks if proper security measures aren't taken beforehand (including learning how secure your connection is before entering any personal data). Additionally, unless you've already interacted directly with a given retailer before placing an order you have no way of knowing exactly what quality service to expect from them after-the-fact; meaning goods may take longer than expected to arrive or come in unsatisfactory condition upon arrival - raising issues over warranty claims down the road if needed too as well potentially! Finally - while refunds & exchanges may be offered under certain circumstances - buyers do not have the same level of leverage when dealing directly with sellers like they would when transacting offline inside physical stores",1
"Windsurfing is an exciting sport that combines sailing with surfing. It involves riding on a board and using the wind to propel you through the water. Many people find windsurfing to be both challenging and exhilarating, as it requires skill and balance. There are numerous techniques for mastering this sport, making it suitable for everyone from beginner to advanced levels of experience. The basics of windsurfing are relatively simple; however, there is a lot more complexity behind each maneuver than meets the eye. To get started, one must first understand how different types of sails work together with the direction and speed of the prevailing winds in order to move forward correctly across the water. With practice comes mastery over these elements as well how best to use them according to changing conditions encountered while out on open waters or courses set up at beaches or other locations specific for recreational sports activities like windsurfing. Once familiar with controlling your sailboard’s course through basic maneuvers such as turning and tacking using correct body positioning, then you can start working on more advanced techniques like jumping over waves or performing flat spins and pop-ups tricks similar to those used by professional surfers in competitions around the world. This will take dedication but also help strengthen skills necessary when taking part in races amongst fellow enthusiasts whether leisurely or competitively angling for titles offered by certifying bodies overseeing sports events involving this type activity within their scope of operations worldwide today. Each time spent out on the water practicing new moves will bring improved control over your equipment allowing unprecedented freedom when gliding atop waves under powerful winds which seems almost magical when enjoyed amidst beautiful scenery surrounded by nature mesmerizing anyone who takes part in this thrilling pastime becoming addicted after just one session!",1
"The Benefits of Coding for Children. As technology advances, the importance of coding is becoming increasingly clear. Learning to code can give kids an edge in the job market when they grow up and help them develop essential skills that will stay with them throughout their lives. For children, learning to code has a unique set of benefits that allow them to foster creativity while also acquiring new knowledge and building problem-solving abilities. To begin with, coding provides children with an opportunity to learn valuable computational thinking skills by breaking down complex problems into smaller pieces which can then be solved logically. This kind of logic allows kids to come up with creative solutions and become better problem solvers overall. The process of writing code also helps build confidence as children take pride in seeing immediate results from their efforts. Coding promotes collaboration as well because it’s often done in teams or groups that work together on a project or program; this teaches kids how to communicate effectively and encourages teamwork as everyone works towards a common goal. . On top of all these benefits, coding comes with its own intrinsic reward—the satisfaction gained from tackling difficult challenges like creating something out of nothing or pushing past mental blocks when stuck on a problem are great motivators for continued learning and development! Plus, learning how computers think opens up entirely new possibilities beyond programming itself; understanding computers gives one mastery over machines rather than feeling intimidated by them – something invaluable in today’s world where automation continues to play an ever bigger role in our lives. . In summary, programming offers young people numerous advantages such as developing critical thinking skills, honing problem solving abilities, gaining confidence through tangible results achieved quickly and collaboratively working towards goals -all while having fun! Knowing some basic computer language may even open doors they never knew existed later on down the road! So why not get started now?",1
"The internet has changed how we communicate and share information in remarkable ways over the past two decades. Email, social media, online news sites, and other web-based platforms have become essential to our daily lives. But one area that has seen especially profound changes is video streaming services. With streaming technology now available on nearly any device with an internet connection, viewers can watch virtually anything they want from anywhere in the world at any time of day or night. Video streaming services offer a wide range of content tailored to individual preferences and interests--from movies and TV shows to music videos, live events such as concerts or sports games, educational seminars or lectures and even unique user-generated material created by everyday people just for fun. Most subscription streaming platforms allow users access to an expansive library of titles for a low monthly fee; however there are also numerous free options available through which viewers can legally stream content without cost—though these may include advertisements during viewing breaks. But beyond providing entertainment value alone, video streaming offers opportunities for personal growth and education as well: many providers feature documentaries about history or science; others host “how-to” tutorials demonstrating skills ranging from home repair to cooking techniques; still more provide virtual field trips allowing students around the world a firsthand look at museums right from their living rooms (or classrooms). Although some worry that increased reliance on digital technologies will reduce face-to-face interactions between individuals—especially among younger generations—video streaming remains popular across age groups due its sheer convenience: no long lines waiting outside theaters; no need to pay costly cable bills every month; best of all –no getting off your couch!. It's clear that video streaming services continue to be incredibly influential in terms of how we consume media today–and this trend is likely only going up as technology advances further into the 21st century. For those looking for new worlds within their own homes who wish to explore them with little effort required –streaming certainly provides",1
"Mars the red planet is our next destination for the human race and we want to find out as much as we can about it before fully exploring it. Something interesting has occured and many people think that it's the work of aliens. Why would aliens want to buid a giant face? Is it really the work of aliens or just a natual landform? I'll tell you why it's just a natural landform and not an ancient Egyptian-like pyramid.

With the recent photographs of the so called face it has become clear to me that it is just a natural landform as seen in the picture taken in 2001. The phoograph shows that the mesa is made from the same dirt as the dirt around it. If aliens wanted to buid shelter, wouldn't they want to buid something more sturdy? Also wouldn't there be a quarry of some sort to get the resorces to build that thing? It is just a natual landform just like the ones you would see on Earth.

As said in the article, the time of year that the photo was taken was during a cloudy time of year so that could have made the photo blurry and harder to see thus making the mesa look like a face. Garvin even says that it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Mars is a cold desert planet with very little atmosphere or resources. There have been signs of water on Mars but that is long since gone. If there was life on Mars it's long gone but it is very unlikely for life to have ever existed there.

Space harbors mysteries and we as humans have a desire to uncover them. When something wierd happens (the face) we get to work in uncovering what it really is. There really is only one way to find out what it is for certain; we have to go there and see for ourselves which will bring up more and more questions about space.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly clear as cities and communities around the world experiment with new approaches to transportation. One such example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany where cars are not allowed on the streets except for a few designated areas. This experiment has led to numerous benefits for the residents, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a sense of community and livability.

According to an article in the New York Times, cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities like Vauban can make a significant impact on reducing these emissions. The article also mentions that Vauban's streets are peaceful and quiet, with the swish of bicycles and the sound of children playing replacing the noise of car engines.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. Paris, for example, implemented a partial driving ban during a period of smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. The ban targeted even-numbered license plates one day and odd-numbered plates the next, and nearly 4,000 drivers were fined for violating the ban. While there were complaints from delivery companies about lost revenue, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars with three or more passengers.

Another example of the benefits of limiting car usage can be seen in Bogota, Colombia, which has implemented a car-free day for the past three years. This day encourages alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation. The event has been successful in reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. Other cities in Colombia have also joined in the event, and municipal authorities from other countries have come to witness and learn from the event.

The end of car culture is predicted by many experts, as Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This trend has environmental implications as transportation is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. With advancements in technology and changes in behavior, people are finding alternative means of getting around, such as telecommuting, shared van services, and bike-sharing programs. The decrease in driving by young people is particularly notable, with studies showing a 23 percent decrease between 2001 and 2009.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a shift towards a more sustainable and livable environment. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota show that it is possible to create thriving communities without cars, and that alternative modes of transportation can be successful and beneficial. As we continue to prioritize the environment and seek ways to reduce our carbon footprint, limiting car usage is a significant step in the right direction.",1

Dear Senator [Senator’s Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong endorsement towards retaining the Electoral College system for the presidential election of the United States. The founding fathers established the Electoral College as a democratic method of selecting the president (Posner), a setup that for centuries has ensured the ability of electors to act as proxy voters (Office of the Federal Register). As a [state] resident, I believe this vital institution promotes national coherence, protects diverse interests, and enhances the weight of my individual vote.

First, the Electoral College promotes a balanced distribution of political influence across the United States. Due to the requirement of a trans-regional appeal, candidates' appeal must span across different regions to garner sufficient electoral votes (Posner). This compels them to address the needs and concerns of various constituencies rather than focusing solely on population-dense urban areas or politically homogeneous regions.

Second, the Electoral College system naturally safeguards against the potential cataclysms of an election. As Posner outlined, the winner-take-all system and the allocation of electoral votes across states often curtails disputes over popular votes. The system reduces uncertainties and provides a clearer verdict, thus ensuring the stability of our political landscape.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is outdated and undemocratic (Plumer), I believe these arguments overlook the unique democracy of the United States. The population disparity among states adds complexity to a direct popular vote system, and it could risk marginalizing less populous regions. Moreover, the possibility of faithless electors or electoral ties is an exceptionally rare occurrence, and these potential issues should not be seen as systemic flaws (Plumer).

Additionally, the emphasis on swing states prompts voters in these regions to be more discerning and informed, encouraging an engaged electorate (Posner). The beauty of our electoral process is that it allows voters to participate in the shaping of our country, regardless of whether their candidate of choice wins. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an essential component of our unique democratic process that preserves the republic's character and history. I urge you to continue in the defense of the system, ensuring the preservation of our signal democratic institution. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"In the past two decades, we have seen a massive shift in the way people get around. Cars are becoming increasingly expensive, and public transportation is becoming more and more accessible. In addition, people are becoming more and more aware of the environmental impact of cars. For these reasons, I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

The cost of cars is only going up. The price of gas, insurance, and maintenance is increasing, while the average salary is not. More and more people are opting for public transportation or ride-sharing services because they simply cannot afford to own a car.

Public transportation is becoming more and more accessible. In many cities, there are now subway systems, light rail, and buses that can take people where they need to go. In addition, many companies are now offering employees shuttle services to and from work. As public transportation becomes more accessible, people are less likely to need to own a car.

People are becoming more and more aware of the environmental impact of cars. Cars produce a large amount of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. More and more people are wanting to do their part to reduce their carbon footprint, and one of the best ways to do this is to ditch the car.

In twenty years, I believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. The cost of cars is increasing, public transportation is becoming more accessible, and people are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of cars. For these reasons, I believe that the number of cars on the road will decrease in the next twenty years.",1
"In the world of intellectual pursuit, it has long been held that the most significant breakthroughs in any field of inquiry come from the experts and not the beginners. This is not always the case, however, and there are many examples throughout history of beginners making important discoveries in their chosen fields. Ultimately, while experts in any field typically bring more knowledge and experience to their research, it is not always the case that they are the ones who make the most important discoveries.

When examining the greatest discoveries of any field, one will usually find that the people who made them were not necessarily experts. For example, many famous scientists, such as Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, and Isaac Newton, all made important discoveries in their respective fields despite not being considered experts yet. In fact, some of their greatest discoveries were made before they had even completed their education or become renowned in their fields. This shows that it is possible for a beginner to make important discoveries, even if they do not have the same knowledge and experience as an expert.

Another example of a beginner making an important discovery is the case of the humble fruit fly. In the early 20th century, the fruit fly was an important subject of genetic research. It was a beginner, Thomas Hunt Morgan, who made the important discovery that genes are carried on chromosomes, a revelation that revolutionized the field of genetic research. Morgan was not an expert in genetics at the time, but was instead a zoologist who was just beginning to explore the field of genetics. His discovery was so significant that he would later go on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933.

It is also important to note that beginners often have a more open-minded approach to their research than experts. This can be a major advantage, as it allows them to think outside of the box and come up with new ideas or approaches that experts may have overlooked. For example, in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin was a beginner in the field of electricity. When everyone else was trying to find a single answer to electricity, Franklin proposed an entirely new approach: that electricity was comprised of two distinct forces – positive and negative. This was a revolutionary idea at the time, and it was a beginner's open-mindedness that allowed him to make this important discovery.

In conclusion, while experts certainly bring more knowledge and experience to research in any field, it is not always the case that they make the most important discoveries. Beginners can often think outside the box and come up with groundbreaking ideas that experts may have overlooked, allowing them to make their own important discoveries in their chosen field. Therefore, it is possible for beginners to make important discoveries, and they should not be overlooked in any field of inquiry.",1
"Many believe that the Face on Mars was actually created by aliens.

This landform gives off the illusion that it is a face.

To clear all confusion, the Face on Mars wasn't created by aliens.

As the cameras traveled around Mars what appeared to be a head from end to end stretching two miles was actually a Martian mesa.

Martian mesa's are common around Cydonia therefore NASA made the assumption that it was.

This Martian mesa was a bit different than the others.

This one had unusual shadows that gave off the look to be an Egyptian Pharaoh but was still considered a mesa.

Secondly, this landform was common around the American West.

This butte or mesa was just more oddly shaped than the others. This landform was created by a lava dome which caused it to look like a face somehow.

Garvin refrenced the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho which is another idea that it was just a landform.

On the contrary, this could be an alien made figure. The landform gave off an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

The passage also stated the landform stretched two miles from end to end which made the head.

If the structure was bona fide that means it was well-rounded and nicely structured which means it took time to come together then it was done by what we call a second life.

NASA would rather hide that being afraid of conspiracy theorists.

To conclude, the Face on Mars isn't an actual face.

This structure is just a landform proven by NASA with statistical facts and photographs.",0
"From small town suburbs to largely populated cities, car usage can drastically affect a community. In developed worlds, personal automobiles are an increasingly popular trend, and help people go about their day to day business. Many would rather drive down the street to a grocery store of job instead of walking there even though it is common knowledge that the pollution and other harmful emissions cars create is bad for the enviroment and the people living there. The question remains, what are the advantages of limiting car usage?

Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular car, can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, Paris bans driving due to smog, it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday. In another article called Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Both of these articles explain how limiting car usage in a city can be benificial to both the city and its residents.

In addition, the United States in partaking in this quest for less cars as well. Article The End of Car Culture by Elizabeth Rosenthal shows us that recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. It is possible that this is partially because of the recession; many Americans could not afford cars. Also, more center cities have made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn the empty nesters back in.  If this goes on, scientists believe carbon emissions could greatly reduce and this will be extremely benifical for the enviroment. According to the Mr. Sivak's research, less and less people between the age of 16-39 have been getting licenses. More studies have concluded the same results, but only time will tell in this trend will continue. No matter the reason behind it, this example also demonstrates how limited car usage is benificial.

On the other hand, some believe that less cars is NOT benificial. In source four, it claims that the lowered amount of people driving automobiles will be harmful to the profits of the car industry. To further explain, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves 'mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle. This, without a doubt, is to combat the loss of sales and encourage people to continue buying their products. However, thos is pretty much all there is on the negative side of limited car usage. For the rest of the community, this doesn't affect them and is in fact quite benificial.

Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.",0
"In the old world, people didnt have car's, they did everything on foot. They got food, ran erronds, and just to get out of the house with the family. So how come now adays people are so dependent on their car's. Places around the world are implimenting rules or laws now to stop people from abusing the car.

Since the car was invented it has always had the same issue, not the engine or the interior, but the environmental issue. And now that people around the world are realizing that, they have created rules and laws to ban or reduce the usage of cars. A community in Germany called Vauban have given up their car's to help the environment, and people love it. When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two.

Paris The Love City in France has Banned cars because of the high amount of smog it creates. After the law was placed, only after five days, congestion was down 60 percent.

Paris has the most smog compared to any other European captials, they had to do this or the smog would take over the city. And since the ban has been posted, smog has been clearing and is now much more limited in the area.

Major cities like New York were built in a narrow way, so its more congested when too many people are driving, and the buildings are much closer together so its more convinent to walk or bike to places rather than drive. New York has implimented a new bike-sharing program, and it is a hit. And around the nation a similar program is the car-sharing program. It encourages people about car pulling, it is when multiple people go to work or school in the same car, it puts less cars on the road and has plentiful benifits. Like less carbon dioxide in the air, less traffic, and saves on gas money.

Bill Ford, an exeuctive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, pitched a plan to live in a world that owning a personal car was impractical. He proposed to partnering with telecommunications industy to make a city or many where the pedestions, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety.

Banning cars around the world isn't a solution because they are more convinent than taking a train or walking, but their needs to be a cut down on the amount we use a car, we abuse it. Eventually all the greenhouse gases might end up destroying the planet we live on. But their are solutions, implementing a world day were we dont use cars would help tremendusly, their are other means of getting around other than car. For example Biking is a great form of excersice and will get you to were you need to be faster than walking, while getting in shape at the same time.",0
"Do you really want your children living in a world covered in smog and crouded streets? It is shown that all of our development sense World War II has been centered on the car and this really needs to chang.

First off studies show that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe.. And those number are 4 times higher in America, the land that you are raising your children in has the highest amount of greenhouse gases on the planet right now. If we could just do what the people in Paris did we can easily fight this smog epidemc. In Paris the put a law out were people with even-numbered license plates had to leave their cars at home or the would face a $31 dollar fine. then they carried out the rule the next day for people with odd-numbered license plates. This rule cut down the congestion by almost 60 percent in the capital. And after five days of this new act the smog over paris finally left.

Also in Colombia they have a program that is some what like paris whish is having a huge turnout. Many people are saying that the car free day is a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution. The funny part is that this event is spreading troughout the neighboring countries. This day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. and it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bike paths, which is the most amount in all Latin American city's. SO why is it takening the U.S so long to jump into this program?

The final thing we need to talk about is that even though fewer and fewer people are getting their licenses its still not enough. And even though the researchers say that America is past its love affair with cars its still not enough. To truely make a change people like you and me need to get up and actually do something. Even if we can't get the goverment or state to pass it. We as a community can put our own no car days into action and just start walking.

Now that you know the risks about this rising epidemic known as smog how do you feel about the way the world is looking? And how esay it would be to just fix what we have be doing such a thing as walking. But truley is this a world you want to raise your children in?",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system and to argue in favor of keeping it, as opposed to changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information presented in various texts, including What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, and In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner, I believe that the Electoral College remains the most effective and beneficial method of electing our nation's leader.

One of the key reasons to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome, as stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote tends to exceed their share of the popular vote, creating a clear and decisive outcome. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results, unlike what may occur in a direct popular vote system.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates are incentivized to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This helps to prevent the election of a candidate with only regional support, promoting national unity and representation for all citizens.

The existence of swing states is another significant advantage of the Electoral College system, as explained by Judge Posner. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates are compelled to pay closer attention to the concerns, interests, and needs of these states and their constituents. This leads to a more informed and thoughtful electorate, as swing state voters play a pivotal role in deciding the outcome of the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that large states are not overlooked, as highlighted by Judge Posner. In a campaign, presidential candidates give more attention to states with larger populations due to the number of electoral votes at stake. This balances the political influence of large states, counteracting the mal-apportionment of power caused by the Senate's constitutional mandate for equal representation of each state.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, as mentioned by Judge Posner. By requiring a candidate to win a majority of electoral votes to secure the presidency, the system avoids the complications and costs associated with subsequent run-off elections. Instead, it ensures a clear winner, promoting stability and efficiency in the election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states considered safe for a particular party, it is important to emphasize that voters are motivated by their desire to express a political preference, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article. The knowledge that their vote may not directly impact the election's outcome does not prevent individuals from participating in the democratic process and exercising their right to vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial institution that upholds the principles of our Constitution and supports our democratic system. Its preservation ensures a fair and representative election process, while promoting national unity, thoughtful campaigning, and the importance of every region's voice. For these reasons, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College and reject any proposals to change to a popular vote system.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I trust that you will consider my perspective and weigh it alongside the views of others to make an informed decision that best serves our nation's interests. I appreciate your dedication and service to our state and our country.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"In recent years, the debate about whether society should make extraordinary efforts to save endangered species, despite the cost in terms of money, jobs, and time, has been a heated one. On one hand, some people feel that it is our moral obligation to take action to save these species. On the other, others feel that the cost of doing so is too great and the effort too burdensome to justify saving these species. While I do sympathize with both sides of the argument, I believe that society should make extraordinary efforts to save endangered species.

One of the main reasons I believe society should make an effort to save endangered species is because of the importance of biodiversity. Biodiversity is defined as the variety of plants and animals in a particular ecosystem, and it is essential for the functioning of that ecosystem. If one species of plant or animal becomes extinct, it can lead to a domino effect that can drastically alter the ecosystem. For example, if a certain species of bee were to become extinct, it would have an adverse affect on the flowers it pollinates, which in turn could lead to other species of plants becoming endangered as a result. This demonstrates how important it is to have a diverse range of species in any given ecosystem, and why we should make an effort to protect that diversity.

Another reason why I believe society should make an effort to save endangered species is because of the potential for new discoveries. Each species of plant or animal has it's own unique traits that can offer valuable insight into the natural world. For example, the Gooty sapphire-blue tarantula, which was recently rediscovered in India after being considered extinct for more than 100 years, is providing valuable information about spider behavior. By making the effort to save endangered species, we can unlock a wealth of knowledge that could be used to improve the lives of humans in a variety of ways.

Finally, preserving endangered species is a moral imperative. As human beings, we have a responsibility to protect the environment and the species that inhabit it. The protection of endangered species is a part of this responsibility, and it is something that we should not take lightly. By making the effort to save these species, we can demonstrate our commitment to protecting the environment for future generations.

In conclusion, I believe that society should make extraordinary efforts to save endangered species, despite the cost in terms of money, jobs, and time. This is because of the importance of biodiversity, the potential for new discoveries, and our moral responsibility to protect the environment and it's inhabitants. With a concerted effort, we can ensure that these species will continue to exist and thrive in the future.",1
"With the development of the globalization, English as a global language, has been widely used now.

What is the best way to learn English in China? There are many different ways of learning English. You can take a course at a Chinese university, or you can go to an English-speaking country, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, etc. If you want to study abroad, you should choose a country that is close to your home country. For example, if you live in the U. S., you could study at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) or the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. In China, there are a lot of universities and colleges that offer English courses. Some of them are very good, and some are not so good. The most important thing is to choose the one that suits you the most.",1
"why you should limit car usage? limiting car usage is a great way of helping the air from pollution, less accidents, and less money throwing  out the window. you could just walk, run ride a bike or anything that doesn't require you to use money with. Doing those things could even keep you healthy. pollution is getting  out control these days to much greenhouse gases in the air. its bad we needa do something before it can kill us. like in all of the passages it tells why not using cars is a great way a better way to not us cars.

in the first passage in german suburb, life goeson withoutcars people from vauban, germany are giving up their cars. they are now riding bikes or walking. 70 percent of people from there dont use cars. people are happy there. people are selling their cars to live there. yes you could drive a car but there is only like 2 parking spaces. you could buy a space for 40,000$ along with a home. they are just trying to help out to keep the air clean.

in the second source paris bans driving due to smog the city was almost about to reach their record pollution but they enforced a couple days banning to clear air. people would be fine 31$. but 4,000 people didn't listen. but people had their cars impounded for their reaction. diesel full was to blame since france tax policy favors diesel over gasoline. paris is the most pulluted city in europe. but good thing happened the smog cleared up.

in the source 3 car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota millions of colombians were biking, hiking, skated, or took buses. people would be fine 25$ if not following the law. it will help reuce the smog, the pollution. two other cities cali and valledupar have joined the event. people from other countries have came to colombia to watch this event. it is the straight year for this event. now since the event is going well more sidewalks have been made.

in the last source the end of the car culture says that america is now using lesser cars buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses. sociologists says it will be good for the enviroment and for beneficial implications for carbon emissions. but will be bad for car industrys.

using less cars is good thing because more socializing less accidents less pollution less greenouse gases. this would help you save money give you exercise. it could help the enviroment people would get better at being active. maybe the world should have a week once a year that  we don't use cars to lower pollution. escpecially bejing since it is the most polluted city in the world.",0
"In a world of large cities and distant suburbs, transportation is crucial, but is personal transportation truly necessary? Shouldn't there be a way of getting from point A to point B without expending an unnecessary amount of harmful gases that could one day bring around our demise? As specified by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky the answer to these questions is yes. Yes, there is hope for a healthier future without the use of bows, Toyota Corollas, Mercedes, and other modes of personal transportation that pollute the Earth. These answers have been noticed by our World's leaders and they are finally taking initiative to save our planet.

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer for the New York Times, Germany is one of the many countries beginning to take notice. This is evident in the building of a small suburb called Vauban where life goes on without cars. Although approximately 30 percent of the residents in Vauban do own a car, it is clear that the 5,500 people living in this small town are happier residing in a place where vehicles do not crowd the streets. As said by a mother living in Vauban When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.

This idea of a car reduced community is not only seen in Germany but might very well soon be found in other countries such as the United States. These ideas today might just be seen by the public as what they are: ideas. However, serious action must be taken now. Although personal transportation might be seen as a necessity by your average citizen, it is not. Personal vehicles are a luxury that we use at, no only our own risk, but at the risk of everyone forced to breathe the intoxicating fumes of these polluting machines. According to recent data, 12 percent of green house gas emmisions in Europe come from passenger cars but this number is not nearly as shocking as that of the United States: 50 percent!

As stated by Robert Duffer and Andrew Selsky, writers for the Chicago Tribune and Seattle Times, Paris and Bogota have come to understand the consequences of the use of personal cars and are taking small steps to better the circumstances brought on to the human population due to the car pollution. In Paris, however, the city had to undergo a hard blow from reality for the french government to understand how crucial this change is. After suffering near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban on the driving of passenger cars in order to clear the air. If the ban was not respected by an individual, heshe would be forced to pay a 22euro fine. Although there were a few who did not follow the terms of the ban, the majority of the people did comply and the smog soon cleared.

For Bogota, however, the ban of passenger cars for a single day has been seen as more of a holiday. The people of this city have come to enjoy this somewhat stress free day away from cars. According to the Bogota mayor, Antanas Mockus, event the rain has not stopped people from participating in this day. This day is not as small of a step as you might think however. For it is a program set to spread to various countries where, for a single day a year, people will bike, hike, roler blade, etc. In other words, everything they MUST do to get from point A to point B.

Finally, as countries around the world begin to take initiative towards the better of our planet, the United States, one of the world's super powers is starting on it's path towards recovery. In the past years, data has come to support the fact that there truly is a shift in the American way of life. As seen in recent studies, Americans are buying fewer cars , driving less and getting fewer licenses as times goes on. Although the United States peaked in miles driven in 2005 it is evident that, with time, that amount gradually declined and hit a low in April 2013 where the miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. As a cause of this sudden hit on the use of cars researchers are beginning to ask: could the United States truly be entering a new era away from the pollution of passenger vehicels or is this just another phase?

Passenger vehicles and the gases they create could very well be the demise of our existence on Earth. This is unless, as a human poopulation, we begin to take action now. Although scientists everywhere have stressed the negative impact on the Earth brought on by cars, people are blind to see that these vehicles are not a necessity but rather a luxury. For this, it is crucial that countries and leaders around the world follow what others have done and begin to enforce the protection of the planet's health and ensure our survival as a species.",0

The author also uses description to prove that Venus is a dangerous planet. The author does that by talking about the weather ,and observations that they found. Text vidence that supports this is in the text it says,Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes ,powerful earthquakes ,and frequent lightning strikes to probe seeking to land on it's surface.This shows that the author is proving the fact that the weather in Venus is more severe than any other planet in the solar system. Another piece of evidence that supports that is in the text it says,Modern computers are enormously powerful ,flexible ,and quick ,but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.This shows that the author gave a point by finding out about observations of how powerful ,well-advanced technology can not survive in a place like Venus.

This is why I think the author used an abundant amount of information to prove that Venus is a dangerous planet that people can study ,because of it's geological study of weather,and it's conditions .This shows that the author proved his/her point that Venus is the most dangerous planet that people could explore .The author does this by giving information,making observations,and giving description to help the reader understand how dangerous this planet is .",0
"It is a common belief that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more desirable than specializing in one specific subject. I agree with this sentiment for many reasons.

The most prominent advantage of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that it boosts one’s general intellectual capacity. When an individual is exposed to different fields of learning, they are able to draw connections between them and expand their understanding of each individual topic. For example, someone who studies both psychology and sociology is better able to understand the complex nuances of each field, as they are able to view them in the context of the other. This allows for a more holistic understanding of the world around us.

Another benefit of having a broad knowledge of many academic fields is that it equips individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the modern professional world. In the current age, employers are seeking candidates who can demonstrate knowledge and expertise across various disciplines. By learning multiple topics, an individual is able to better position themselves for success in the job market.

Finally, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects encourages curiosity and exploration. When one is exposed to different topics, it can encourage an individual to ask questions and look for patterns in the material. This can cultivate a sense of appreciation for knowledge that can lead to long-term learning and personal growth.

In conclusion, it is clear that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is preferable to specializing in one specific subject. Not only does it boost one’s intellectual capacity and equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary for success, but it can also encourage lifelong learning and personal growth.",1
"Feelings and emotions are ways we show people how we act and what we are feeling at that moment. Only we know what we are feeling at times or even at that moment. Our emotions determine who we are and what we show from the expressions from our face. Its hard to determine what a person is thinking and what they are feeling at any moment of time. I think it is time though because someone has found a way to determine someone's emotions.

Finally someone has found a way to determine someone's feelings and emtions with a simple computer program. The person who worked and worked to show us this is Dr. Huang from Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans to communicate with computers. This idea for trying to communicate with computers brought up the idea of the feelings and emotions of a human being. They use simple calculations of the facial movements that are used to determine your feelings and emotions.

They begin the process with a 3-D process of the face and control every muscle on the face to mimic the emotions and feelings of a human being and that is amzing. The movements of the face is called a action unit. Dr. huang relies on a psychologist to determine the emotions of that scan and to give six emotions that will determine every humans feelings within those six basic emotions. I think that these basic emotins are basically all the emotions any human uses for every day life. Thats why Dr. Paul Eckman picked them because them are the most common and most used emotions ever.

In paragraph three is the way humans move their muscles on their face to show emotions. Facial expressions are the one way humans can determine how someone is doing or feeling at that moment of time. In paragraph four they talk about how the program can even show that facial expressions of how Mona Lisa was feeling or what emotions she had of the time of the painting. The fact that we perform the same impressive calculation of determining a person's feelings just by looking at them is a perfect way for them to study and perfect the programs way to scanning emotions. The demonstractions of each scan are amazing at showing what the program and the computer can really do at a time where technology is at it's prime.

I feel like the computer and the humans who are trying to communicate with them are a great way to show feelings and emotions through talking. This program is gonna change the world of technology and the world of emotions for the better of the country and it's people. I think that what they are doing is a very constructive way of showing that you can find ways to determine a person's well being and their happiness. This program should be kept going at it's fullest for lots of years and should get to a point where it even helps out the crime system. As a last thought the program has to perfect this to get to maximum use of what should be used to help determine these feelins and emotions for the better.",0
"When thinking about the topic of procrastination, it is essential to discuss why individuals tend to put things off even when they are aware of the consequences. It can be difficult to resist the temptation of indulging in activities that seem more pleasurable than completing tasks that may not have an immediate reward. Procrastination often occurs when people feel overwhelmed by a task at hand or lack motivation. However, if left unchecked this habit can lead to major issues such as missed deadlines and poorer quality work. The primary reason why people fall into this trap is because they overestimate their ability to complete certain tasks within a given time frame and set unrealistic expectations for themselves. For example, if someone has two weeks to finish an assignment but assumes it will only take one week then suddenly having one day left before its due date could cause significant stress resulting in them putting it off until later on instead of using their available time efficiently from the start. Other causes include overthinking a task or feeling too paralyzed by perfectionism which leads them down a rabbit hole instead of taking action straight away; both scenarios result in minimal progress being made causing further procrastinating habits. Nevertheless, there are ways we can overcome this problem with some adjustments in our daily routine like breaking down larger projects into smaller pieces so that each step seems less intimidating as well as setting realistic goals rather than aiming too high right away and thus avoiding burnout along the way towards achieving our end results - something important enough since procrastinating just compounds all existing difficulties making any kind of progression much harder than necessary! Additionally establishing regular check-ins with ourselves throughout each project gives us an opportunity for reflection on what has been accomplished already which helps alleviate anxiety associated with large scale undertakings while also providing feedback allowing us make improvements where needed quicker instead waiting until deadline approaches again only half finished!. . . Finally understanding how our brain works when under pressure could prove instrumental helping avoid future relapses - primarily acknowledging potential distractions beforehand while actively planning",1
"Ever since you were little, have you ever noticed that your really good at something as you grew over time? Everyone has a talent or a skill that are common or very unique. I have gained a talent over years and I just realized not to long ago. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love.

My number one talent is hip-hop. Hip-hop's really been a big part of my dancing life over years. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. I have once broken my ankle by learning a new dance move. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was able to rest, I just had the fear of not being able to dance and it made my heart shatter into 7. After a 8 or 9 weeks I felt better and was able to dance again. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. when I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. Once I was there for almost a year I learned a lot because they would tell me little secrets of their's. I got better ever since and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a lot with my dancing skills.

I got inspired by the artist I love the most. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. I watched their video's and I was in love with them. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song called No More Dream. They were called BTS. There are a seven member group, there stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They are a band from South Korea. Their fan's are called ARMY. As years passed by and they became the biggest boy band in the whole universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. I learned all their dance moves from their music video's to their stage performances. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept telling me to keep going which I did and that's when I made up my mind. I was now planning to become a back up dancer for them when they went on tour. I was planning to already become a dancer so I practiced more. When I became 13 I was able to dance and more like some one was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet.

Now that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. It's been 9 years of dancing so why not. After learning to dance hip-hop I felt like an animal that's been let back in the wild. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. BTS has taught people many things but the one line they said about dancing is There are 2 deaths in life. The first one is when you lose the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. The first death though is more painful. Those are not the exact but very close to the meaning. My number one talent is dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired but the artiest I love the most. What's the one talent that you have, do you actually want to become better or move on.",0
"Is there any advantages of limiting car usage? Whether it's for the environment or even your health, there are some advantages that overall can help you. Lets be honest, cars aren't cheap and i don't really see them getting any cheaper but walking from point A to point B is free. It's kind of like killing two birds with one stone, by walking you save the environment from the gas you would be burning and you're saving money at the same time.

Limiting or even completly getting rid of driving can help you become a happier or even tense free person. Driving a vehicle, especially on a congested highway or road can create road rage causing you to become more stressful and aggravated. In a suburb in Germany, residents there are giving up their cars, something they have never done before. They seem to be working efficiently without their cars, still being able to go to the store and work. It seems that they like this way of life better, stress free and no worry of getting stuck in traffic. Like what Heidrun Walter explained in source one, she said When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. People are so infatuated with the thought of driving and cars but they don't realize that driving all the time is effecting your health. Personally, I think it's some of the reason as to why there is so much obesity in this world.

Not only is driving all the time bad for your health but it's also bad for the environment. Paris had a problem with there being so much smog, that they actually had to enforce a partial ban from driving. The partial ban was working, it was said in source 2 that after five days of intensifying smog, congestion went down 60 percent in the capitol of France. The partial ban worked with trying to clear out the smog to help the environment so well that the French party rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on tuesday's. Source 3 explained that in Columbia they were going on there third year of cars being banned except for buses and taxis. Just like in Germany people seemed to being adjusting and liking the idea of no cars on the roadway. A business man named Carlos Arturo Plaza, said that It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution referring to Columbias third year of banning cars.

Even if you just have to go right down the street, people hop in there cars and go, when in fact you can just walk. An official of Transportation for America,David Goldberg, expressed about how depended we are on vehicles. He said All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. And change is what seems to be exactly happening. In source 4 it was said that there seemed to be a decline in America's love affair with their vehicles. According to Doug Short, who is apart of an investment research comapany said that When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. Maybe people are starting to realize that you don't necessarily need to drive and that it's more of previlge then a must.",0
"Education is an essential issue concerning not only the development of human being but also the development of society and the whole country. It is the duty of the government to ensure that every child gets the best education possible.

Education is not just about learning to read and write, but it is also about understanding the world around us and how we can make it a better place for ourselves and our children to live in.",1
"To some people the limit of car use is very important to them, because they want to stop pollution or things. In the city of Vauban, Germany they do not use cars because, to start off with to even park a car you would have to pay $40,000 plus the price of your house to be able to park it at a parking garage. The city has worked for two decades to make Vauban, Germany better for walking. Which made Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. This made people all around the world consider to reduce car use, in America the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communities.

Other countries strictly rely on car reducing to take down the amount of polltuion in the air. Paris days after a near-record pollution forced car reduction to everyone. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and many had their cars impounded. People in the capital city of France were starting to get sick and get congestion because of all of the smog, and pollution from cars. For Paris to have car reduction they had to ban any cars with odd numbered license plates from driving for a certain period of time. After all of the pollution in the air had cleared enough they had a party for the people with odd numbered license plates to drive again.

In another occasion of car reduction Bogota, columbia had a car reduced day where people would hike, bike, skate, and take buses to work. They as well used this chance to clear pollution of the air and some people didn't mind it, they had a chance of a stress free day and the ability to lower air population. Any violators who chose to drive a car would be issued a $25 fine. Other countries who did not have car reduced days liked the idea of it, and thought they were generating a revelutionary change. Due to these car reduced days parks and sports centers have been an uprise. The days without cars is a campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s.

In the United States of America government officials have talked about car reducing, but have never passed it. In 2005 the miles driven in America had peaked, and dropped steadily after. Michael Sivak said, What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn. Bill Ford owner of For Motor proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.",0
"Students and their families should consider any activitie that they want to get involved in school before getting in. If students get involve in many of them, then they will not have time to do any of their work from school. Not doing work from school will affect their grades , and they also won't be able to participate anymore, for having bad grades. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the student, should talk to the school and ask if it is posible for their kid to not participate in all of them because of the time, and other responsabilities they have.

First of all students should talk to their parents before taking any desicion, them both need to consider that if the student gets involved in many activities, then they will not have time to do any work from school.

If the students spend too much time on the activities, then he/she would not have time for them other responsabilities. The school should make an runion for parents, so they can agree on the terms that the school want. Activities at school should not be controling, or making the students join so many activities.

If the student does not do the school work, then they will have bad grades, that will affect them by not being able to participate anymore in any of the school actiities. Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students.

Schools are responsable for any activite that it is happening in school, they should contact parents, and also have a reunion, so they would get the parents opinions. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the students, should considered any type of activitie that the student wants to get involved in. Participating in school it is good for students, but not when they do extraactivities.

Some of the activities should be reunating with the students after school, and help them with any questio they have, or repasing anything that they didn't understand in the class.

I think Schools should not control students involvents.

Parents should be the ones desiding, and analizing before allowing their kids join any type of activitie in school. Students should not be able to participate in too many activities that would effect their grades. parents and school should agree on the desicions of wha is going to be better for the students. When students are responsible with their shool work, and their activities, they should get extra credit.",0
"The world has seen countless advancements over the past few decades, from new technology to changes in cultural attitudes and lifestyles. One of these developments is the increasingly popular practice of urban gardening. Urban gardening is a method by which city dwellers can grow their own food and plants within any kind of available space, such as rooftops, balconies, patios or even window boxes. It has become an attractive option for many people living in cities due to its low cost and environmental benefits. Urban gardening allows individuals to have more control over the quality of the fruits and vegetables they put on their plate since they are grown in their own backyards or balconies without any need for pesticides, herbicides or other chemicals that might be present in commercially-grown produce. This form of agriculture also brings several social benefits including reduced stress levels through providing opportunities for physical labor outdoors; it fosters community by bringing neighbors together who may not have otherwise interacted with each other; and it promotes education about local flora as well as sustainable practices related to composting and water conservation. Additionally, growing one's own food eliminates trips to grocery stores while reducing individual carbon footprints since there is no transportation involved when picking one's harvest from home. Urban gardening allows people who live in smaller spaces where traditional farming methods may be impossible access healthy organic food at much lower costs than store bought items would typically require - plus you get all the joys associated with watching your edible creations come into bloom! Furthermore this type of agricultural activity can help counteract some issues caused by soil depletion resulting from years' worth of industrial farming processes which often involve heavy machinery tilling large tracts land repeatedly leading to depleted nutrients deep below ground level making them inaccessible through natural means alone (unless addressed). All this adds up to make urban gardening more feasible both economically & ecologically speaking when compared against commercial agriculture systems widely utilized today which tend rely heavily on expensive equipment & potentially hazardous chemicals while endangering already fragile ecosystems worldwide due too careless use/dis",1

The Electoral Collage is a process of voiig for our Presideit aloig withe thee Vice Presideit aid thee electors.

Uider thee electoral college system, voters vote iot for thee presideit, but for a slae of electors, who ii turi elect thee presideit he asserts. Ai example Plumer gives us is theat if you lived ii Texas at thee time of Johi Kerry, whei he was ruiiiig ofr pesideit, you would have voted for a group of 34 Democratic electos who would theei have voted for Kerry ii retui to votii for his electors.

"Did you know 67 percent of people talk to more than one person for advice. They do that because different people might have different views of the situation. Although some people experienced the situation. The advice might be useful for other people too. It can help them agree with the choice or decision they will make.

One reason why some people might ask more than one person for advice is people might have different views of the situation. Some people will have an idea of what to do and some people won't. Some people might tell you to do wrong things. Some people might not know what your going through therefore they will give you bad advice. Some people will know what they are doing so they will give you good advice.

Secondly why people ask more than one person is some people have experienced it or gone through it. They might know what will happen. They might know what you will see and go though during the experience because they probably gone through it.

Finally why people ask more than one person is to make sure that their doing it right or successfully. To make sure that they know what they are doing. To ask their opinions to see if they are thing as you are. To see if you agree with them. They might have a lot in common with with about the situation.

In conclusion why people ask multiple people for their opinions is to see their points of view and to make sure of what you are doing. The people you ask may have experienced it the thing they are going through",0
"Dear Senator,

I think that we should change to election by popular votes for president. Why have citizens vote when you're going to decide president by electoral votes? The person running with the most votes should win. Let the citizens decide who they want as president.

The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. Which is why people went against the electoral college. It could be worse, nobody wants that. They might be worrying about a tie in the electoral vote.

The election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. The electoral college is unfair to voters. I don't think the electoral college votes are neccessary to decide a president. I am pretty sure ,any people agree.

Many people that were presidence got lucky because of the electoral votes. There are many people that ran for president but lost because of the electoral votes when they shouldn't have lost. Nobody wants a close tie to see who the president is. Electoral college just ruins the point of our rights to vote.

We, as citizens, shouldn't have electoral college to decide who our president is. We should be able to vote and decide the president. The candidates running should win by the most votes. I'm against electoral college.",0
"The Electoral College has been here for many years. Over the aast years many aeoale think it is unfair to the voters. There are many conflicts that have risen about it. Without a doubt , the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because they voters are basically voting for no reason. The aresident they want to vote for doesnt count and instead the votes of the Electoral College do , the electors shouldnt be the only aeoale to vote just because they are qualified doesnt mean only their oainion and choice should be heard. Also , a direct election would be much better and everyones votes count and its equal.

To begin with , when the first Electoral College was made no one really argued about it. But over the many years conflicts have come. Peoale have realized that was is being done istn fair or right.  At the most basic level , the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because the winnertakeall system in each state , candidates dont saend time in states they know the have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing state. source 2, a. 13. Everyone has the right to vote but if their votes dont count whats the aoint?. Peoale should have the right to voice their own oainion and be aart of the voting. The electors that are chosen have only a little amount of oainions. If the voters would be included there would be a variety of choices of who should win. Every american should be comfortable and certain about who they voted for and if the Electoral College votes contradicts that there can be aroblems.

Furthermore , In a direct election everyone is treated equally. Unlike , the voting we have now , If you lived in Texas , for instance , and wanted to vote for John Kerry , you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors aledged to Kerry. source 2, a. 10. Voters cant always control whom their electors vote for but voters sometimes can get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Why have so much going on when you can aeacefully just count the votes of the voters and electors together?. Yes , they may be the electors and might have more knowledge of whats going on but they are just aeoale too and everyone is created equally so definitely their votes shouldnt be the only ones actually counted.

Moreover , Bigger states may have a bigger effect on the votes because of their large amount of aeoale voting. By , not making their vote count some aeoale can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting haaaens for a reason if gives the world a chance to aick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right aerson but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their aower and freedom to saeak.  Voters in aresidential elections ae aeoale who want to exaress a aolitical arefeence rather than aeoale ho think that a single vote may decide an election.source 3 , a.23. The Electoral College may have worked in the aast but now its not working as well.

To conclude , The Electoral College arocess should be stoaaed for numerous number of reasons. It limits aeoales oainions and aeoale are voting for no reason if they cant aick who they want. Whoever is running for aresident and everyone who votes for one aerson shouldnt just be heard from a certai groua of aeoale. Everyones oainion should matter.",0
"In today's world, about everyone has a cell phone & a vehicle. Most people use their phone while they are driving. Drivers believe it's safe but other's believe it's dangerous. In my opinion, I think that drivers shouldn't be driving while using their cell phones. Not only are you putting yourself in danger, your also putting the ones around you in danger. It will also make you more aware of your surroundings.

Driving while using a cell phone can be dangerous. Most drivers like to text while they are driving. That can be dangerous because you will be distracted from the road. The most common cause of car accidents is drivers operating a cell phone while driving. Texting & driving is what causes most car accidents. The driver focus will be more on the phone then the road. When most people get a text or notification on their cell phone, they usually respond or check it immediately.

If drivers stay off their phone while driving, they will be more aware of their surroundings. When driving, you have to be aware of pedestrians & other cars around you. Not all drivers around you will be paying attention while driving. Not only drivers, but other pedestrians around. If children are crossing the road & your focus is on your cell phone & not the road, you are putting them in harm. Being aware of your surroundings is one of the most important things to do when operating a vehicle.

It's important that you don't operate a cell phone while driving. Not only for your safety but for the others around you. If it's a situation when you have to respond immediately, wait until you come to a complete stop or pull over to the side. Safety is more important than anything. The smallest mistake can put you in the biggest situation. That's why you should keep your eyes on the road & off of your cellphone.",0
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky and human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Venus's knickname is sometimes called the Evening Star mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely.

It is also called the Evening Star because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth.

These conditions are far more extreme than anything human would encounter on Earth.

It is not suprising that the temperature average is so high given the fact that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. So basically, if you walk on Venus you will get burns.

Studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky because it is simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.

Yes, Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely, but although it is not clear due to the fact that 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, it is still simple to see from the distant, safe vantage point.

No spacecraft survived for more than a few hours because of the carbon dioxide blanketing clouds of Venus.

The clouds of Venus most likely explains why not a single spacecraft torched down on Venus for more than three decades. Venus's atmosphere at night is not affected by carbon dioxide of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. This is exactly why studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky is simple for an amateur stargazer to spot.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.

So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel.

So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers.

So, If Venus was more of a dangerous planet to explore, walk on, and study, would this be a planet that everyone would be interested to study and afraid to walk on to explore?",0
"Dear Mr. Senator,

I think that we should keep the electoral college. It provides winner take all method, it avoids run-off elections, and there is a certainty of outcome. I feel that the electoral college is not anachorism because it belongs in the present to.

First of all the electoral college should stay because it provides a winner take all method. The winner take all method is getting a swing state. A swing state is good to win because people in toss up states pay close attention to the election. They actually listen  to the canidtes and what they are speking about. They are known to be the most thoughtful voters on average.

Secondly the electoral college should stay because it avoids run off elections. The electoral college makes sure that no canidate recieves a maajority of the votes cast. If no one wins a majority of the votes cast then it would add pressure to the election because it would greatly complicate the presidential election which is reduced by the electoral college. If it wasnt for the electoral college then half of the people like democrats of texas and republicans in california wouldnt vote because their votes dont count.

Third of all the electoral college should stay because it provides a certainty of outcome. A dispute over an outcome is possible but not certain that you would win. But on the other hand a dispute over the popular vote is more likely to win. The reason for that is that a winning canidates share of electoral votes exceeds his share of popular votes. A tie is possible due to the total number of votes being 538 but it is very unlikely.

In conclusion I think that the electoral college should stay because it provides a winner take all method, it avoids run off elections, and it provides a certainty of outcome. I hope that the electoral college stays in the election process forever.",0
"There is no doubt that work has changed over the years. As technology has advanced and global competition has increased, it is true that many jobs have become more stressful and less leisurely. However, I do not agree that work is necessarily more stressful and less leisurely than in the past.

To begin with, many jobs have become more flexible and allow for more leisure time. For example, many employers now offer flexible working hours, allowing employees to choose when they work. This allows them to better balance their work and personal lives, making it easier to find time for leisure activities. Additionally, many jobs now allow for remote work, which means that employees can work from home or any other location. This also gives them more freedom and flexibility in their schedules, making it easier to find time for leisure activities.

Furthermore, there are now more opportunities for people to pursue their passions and hobbies. With the rise of the gig economy, many people are able to make a living by doing what they love. This allows them to enjoy their work and find more time for leisure activities. Additionally, more people are now able to start their own businesses, which gives them the opportunity to work on their own terms and find time for leisure activities.

Finally, many employers now recognize the importance of providing a healthy work-life balance for their employees. They are providing more support and resources to help employees manage their stress levels and make time for leisure activities. This includes offering mental health services, providing flexible work schedules, and offering paid vacation time.

In conclusion, I do not agree that work is necessarily more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. There are now more opportunities for people to pursue their passions and hobbies, and employers are providing more support and resources to help employees manage their stress levels and make time for leisure activities.",1

The angel of the camera could also make a big diffrence in the look of it. the angel of the light that was ln it also could mae the changed because it was the shadow that made the landform look like a human head.

"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the current Electoral College system to instead elect the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College system was established by the founders with the aim of creating a more deliberative process, I believe it no longer serves that purpose and can undermine the principle of one person, one vote.

One of the main arguments against the Electoral College is that it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This has occurred a few times in history, including most recently in 2000 and 2016. When a president can lose the popular vote but still win in the electoral college, it undermines the message that every citizen's vote should count equally. It also may discourage some citizens who vote for the candidate who ends up losing the state from voting at all, since their vote essentially does not matter in deciding the statewide outcome.

Supporters of the Electoral College argue that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing just on population centers. However, election by popular vote could still motivate candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters across many states. Candidates would still need to appeal to voters in smaller states as well as large states to win the national popular vote.  Additionally, campaign visits and ad spending under the current system are disproportionately focused on a handful of swing states, rather than candidates truly needing to build a broad coalition nationally. 

Overall, while the Electoral College may have served purposes when it was established, I believe the popular vote would better uphold the democratic principles of one person, one vote and ensure that every citizen's vote counts equally in presidential elections. It would encourage candidates to engage voters nationwide and could increase voter turnout knowing that every vote directly impacts the national outcome. For these reasons, I ask that you support a legislative proposal to implement a national popular vote for electing the president.

Thank you for your consideration. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1
"One of the primary differences between a four-year high school program and a three-year high school program is the amount of time available for students to study. A four-year program contains more time for students to delve deeply into subject areas, while a three-year program might offer more opportunities to complete electives or take additional courses, thus potentially leading to improved college readiness. Another consideration is the impact of taking a break in the summer months, which four-year students will experience while three-year students will not. Summer break can offer students a much needed respite from their studies, but it can also lead to loss of knowledge for those who do not engage in learning activities during this period. Furthermore, four-year students will have an additional year to explore extracurriculars or participate in programs like internships, but three-year students could, in theory, have more flexibility with their course schedule to fit in nonacademic pursuits. Ultimately, both four-year and three-year programs have their own set of potential benefits for students, however, the decision of which to choose should be based on an individual's educational needs and tendencies.",1
"Gardening is an activity that has become increasingly popular in recent years as people are looking for ways to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The practice involves creating a garden space with plants, trees, flowers, and other natural elements. Gardening offers numerous benefits to both the physical and mental health of its participants. From improving air quality to increasing levels of satisfaction with life, gardening can be an incredibly fulfilling experience. When it comes to starting a garden, it's important to consider size and location first before deciding on which plants or products you'll need. For larger gardens requiring plenty of space and sunlight, perennial shrubs like rhododendrons give a classic look while also providing privacy screening from neighbors or passersby. If you're short on space but still want vibrant colors throughout the garden year-round, annuals such as marigolds are excellent choices since they will bloom continuously when cared for properly. Vegetable gardens are also possible if one chooses wisely regarding soil type; raised beds often work well for those without access to plenty of arable land. Gardening provides many intangible rewards as well: patients who tend their own plots regularly report decreased feelings of stress along with increased feelings of relaxation after spending time outdoors in their gardens each day. Additionally, being able to observe the progress made through hard work can lead to greater self-esteem and confidence over time; this is especially true when considering children participating in gardening activities alongside adults – watching mom or dad caring for plants can help teach young ones about responsibility while at the same time instilling respect for nature’s wonders by allowing them have hands-on experiences within their own little piece of paradise within backyard walls. Overall, gardening offers countless tangible benefits ranging from improved air quality (through photosynthesis) all the way up through enhanced socialization resulting from communal projects undertaken with friends across neighborhoods - there truly is something special about growing your own food! Furthermore, it may even prove",1
"Do you think individuality create a unique way to be your own of life style? Some say individuality make a specific way to achieve goals being yourself. I'm definitely argue with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement about individuality because your own style of works,Nobody tell us what to change , freely to choose your way of thinking.

First, your own style of works. For example, my dear sister  Generic_Name yesterday, she got a phone call.

I was with her, when she answered the phone call , it's was the teacher saying if my sister  Generic_Name  would come at her college, because she was the only one at her class to got a higher score for doing the project with her own creativity and unique steps at the project without following the steps that her teacher being teaching daily at the whole classroom. The teacher told my sister it's a good way to do something with your own ideas without the fear that would be good or bad its just exploring your ability to making great works being yourself .This explain my sister for being the only one to did the project with her own way got the most higher grade.

Second, Nobody tell us what to change. For example,

my sister  Generic_Name, every night, she tell me, how I need to brush my hair correctly, she thinks the hair need a proper care and treatment to brushing the hair . I dont like to do at her way because I feel her way to brush it's more slowly than mine own way to brush my hair, so every night she got mad with me because never use her style to brush the hair. I always said to her, I like to brush my hair at my way and my sister can not tell me to change my way at brushing my beautiful hair. This explain, my sister, don't need to get mad for doing the opposite the she wants to do, I got my style and nobody has to tell me what to change at doing any activity.

Third, Freely to choose your way of thinking. for examples. Generic_Name  my sister told to my mom , if she can participate at the  project of making a novel  in her school , so my mom let to her participate. She thinks that would be the winner for being the most iconic novel might be existed in the world, so she starting to writing it down, each content at her novel but she dont need a examples of novel because she got her own style to write down, she say her novel would be a entertainment novel because her way to thinks it's different at the other types of novels, her novel will be a her own creativity and passion to make the novel the next most read novel in the world. This explain,free thinking its discovering a new person.

Individuality, makes us special to achieve it goals. style of works different than anyone else. we don't need to someone to tell us what to change. Being free to choosing thoughts it 's s a perfect way to express it with the real world .some says individuality is to be a selfish behavior for doing the things at ours own ways but Individuality it's just a sense of life to find your own way to work. In the future individuality would be the secret tool to reach different goals.",0
"Fellow citizens their are many advantage to limiting your car usage. With a wide range from not getting a ticket to helping the environment, and it's a social trend, driving cars are now a thing of the past.

In Vauban, Germany a community where only thirty percent of its entire population owns vehicle. The advantages for not owning a car are displayed in this upscale community by the ability to walk, and ride a bicycles to stores, shops, and restaurants. The secret to this the innovative take on this community, is by not placing these all of stores, shops, and restaurants in some crowed mall, but accessible from a mere walking distant. Also a great way to burn off calories and in time put an end to obesity.

By reducing car usage smog and other pollutants in big cities can be drastically reduced. In Paris congestion of smog was down sixty percent, the way they got people to stop using cars was by putting a fine driving your car for the day almost 4,000 drivers were fined thirty one dollars that day. Another example of this is in Bogota, Colombia here most the millions of people were willing to give up car usage, a program that was started in the mid 1990s called the Day Without Cars with it's goal is to promote an alternative transportation. As a result of this added 118 miles of bicycle track, parks, and sports center to this city. Lower emissions of green house gases are also helping the environment with the help of Day Without Cars program.

People are slowly drifting away from their cars. The miles driven per person in the U.S. has dropped nearly nine percent since it's original peak in 1995. Many things have been suggested to reduced the car usage in the U.S. The number of car ownership per household and per person has come down three years before the downturn of car usage that started in the 2005. People in the U.S. are also more likely to retain a drivers license at an older age as to opposes to the younger age groups between 16to39yearolds.

In conclusion, the age of cars are slowly coming to an end. People are planing for the cleaner and healther future that lies ahead of us, where pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation are woven together into a connected network. The revolution is upond us.",0
"First of all, the Electoral College is regarrded as a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be over powered by declaring the canidate who gets the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does. Most people vote for a presidant just because everyone else did, his/her race, his/her gender, and other things like that. Voting for that presidant with no knowlage about them or what they are capable of. But people tend to vote for that president out of majority because if 50% of the largest state voted yes for this president then we vote for him and then he/she is now president and is not doing anything right and they think that if you take away this or you do that it will solve the problem. But it won't, it'll only make things worse and upset a lot of people.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors ? They can be anyome not holding public office. Sometimes statee conversations, sometimes the presidential candidates themsleves. The single best argument against the electoral college is that we might call the disaster factor.",0
"Author Ralph Emerson wrote, To be yourself in a world that that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. He is totally wrong because to be yourself in a world and make the greatest accomplishment in your life, the wold do not have to take control over you liberty, you should take control over the world to accomplish whats you are going to be. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson did not think before writing these letter because to be yourself in a world, you should have to make your own decisions, do something that you would like to do, and being your self not letting the world to take control over your life.

First thing,

be yourself and never give the right to the world. To make that happen you should have to make your own decisions, because if you let the world to choose for you in the future you may get lost and tire about your life, because you let the world to take control over your life, and for not choosing your own decision. Being your self and not letting the world to try to make something else, is something that will bring goods in your future, because is something that you choose and you know why did you took it and why did you choose it. However, the peoples that let the wold to choose for them they will get tire about life.

The second thing for accomplishment; and not letting the world to control you,is being your self and do what you like to do, never letting the world to do whatever it wants to do with you. If you want to do the greatest accomplishment in your life you should take something that you that you like to do. because when you do something that you like to do you will never going to get tire about doing it, when you like to do something and you wanted to be the greatest accomplishment, you are not going to feel that job like a job because is something that you like to do. But to make that happen and accomplish that dream. never led the world to do what ever it wants with you.

Being your self and not letting the world to take control over your life, the best choice that you can do, because being yourself and choose your own decision will help you to know what to do,what's good , what's bad, what career to choose, and what goal to accomplish because the only person who know all about you is you. So you should not let the world to ruin their life, and take their own decisions and tell the world that you can do it in your own. Lots of people let the world to choose for them and in future they ruin their life and they don't know whats to do for not choosing the correct choice and because they let the world to choose for them.

In conclusion, never led the world to change your life . because if you led the world to choose for you you will never going to get satisfy. Always be your self because if you led the world to choose for you will have a bad and sad feature for for not choosing the right decision. Always do a things what you like to do, like sports or a profession that you would like to be, if you choose things that you like you never going to feel it like a job. sometime you let the world to choose for you, but in the future you will get bored because you did not choose what you like.

"Graduating early from high school and working for a year before college can have lasting benefits for students. For one, they can take that time to save up money for college costs. Although tuition and fees for college are rising year after year, students who work before college and carefully manage their finances can put themselves in a better position to afford college tuition. Furthermore, the experiences gained from working will help mature students and provide them with skills such as time management that will be invaluable in college. 

On the other hand, some may argue that taking a year off to work can be a deterrent to college motivation and preparation. Students who do choose to graduate early and take a year off before college may not feel adequately prepared for the academic rigor that college demands. And given the competition to get into college, a gap year may cause some potential universities to look unfavorably on a student's application. 

Nevertheless, graduating early and working for a year before college has proven to be a beneficial experience for many students. The financial and personal growth opportunities that it provides may ultimately be invaluable to success in college and beyond.",1
"Cell phones and vehicle operation are simply two things that do not mix. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Research Shows that using cell phones while driving nearly doubles the risk of a negative outcome occurring. As mediocre as that sounds it could lead to fatal car crashes, Injuring a pedestrian or even punishment for distracted driving.

According to Edgar Snyder & Associates Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. The outcome of texting while driving is not that important to where lives should be taken to send a text if it's that important then why not just pull over. in the article on edgar Snyder & Associates it also states that 10 percent of all teen motor vehicle crash fatalities in 2016 involved distracted driving. The risk is increasing every time a person pulls out there cell phone.

In the article that was posted on USA Today it stated that U.S pedestrians death totaled nearly 6,000 in 2017 for the second straight year amid signs that walkers and distracted drivers do not mix.Also it states that texting while driving is more risky in a urban environments. Teens that text and drive are more likely to get into an accident than an adult that is even though both are risky studies show that being young while doing it is worse than being older while doing it. The issue at hand is affecting everyone texting while driving or just being on your phone is a bad mix and innocent children and adults are suffering because of it.

Texting while driving can result in many punishments like Monetary fines, Criminal charges and jail or prison time. According to Legalmatch Texting while driving is a moving traffic violation and may be a criminal misdemeanor in certain jurisdictions.

Also,Jail or prison time if the offense has resulted in bodily injury to another driver, jail or prison time may be imposed. The more you get caught texting and driving the worse the punishment will be it could start off with a simple fine and the next time you could be serving jail time. Finally, If you have been hurt due to someones else mistakes you are entitled to compensation at which you can sue them.

In Conclusion, Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The outcome of this can hurt the drivers mentally, physically and even emotionally (if they take someones life in the process).Texting while driving is now one of the most reason drivers are getting fined as technology advances peoples urge to use their cellphones are growing tremendously. It is not worth it to risk your life for a flash of entertainment that isn't going anywhere anytime soon there actually incorporating technology into the vehicles.

"NASA is a goverment funded project that uses science facts, pictures, and advanced technology. NASA has been constintally working hard and, according to the article Unmasking the Face on Mars.

NASA's Viking 1 spacraft was snapping photos of possible landing sights for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. As soon as NASA saw the picture they instantly started going to work to see what it was.

NASA has already created scientific technology for this reason. They would want to get the best looking picture and the most acccurate one. The acticle states, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The first immage they snapped revealed that it was nothing but a landform, but still people were not satisfied. On April 8, 2001 another photo was captured at the cameras maxium view. Each pixil spanned 1.56 meters, compard to Vikings 43 meters per pixel

NASA has been specifically designed to explore outer space and to discover what was there. They have been working even before 1976, Thats more than 40 years! They have only had a number of break throughs, proving that NASA would not hold back information about ancient civilizaions or alien lifeform because it would be a great breakthrough. The defenders of the NASA budget even wished there was an ancient civilization on mars. There was a degree of suprise for mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared. They were fascinated by what they saw.

The alien conspiercy believers may reject the pictures and say they have been tampered with. NASA would not do that, however. They have already spent loads of money for this project and made all the equipment. They would not go through all that trouble just to lie to the public. NASA also took may pictures with their instruments from many angles and different views. They are high resolution photographs and they even have 3D alimetry, according to the article Unmasking the Face of Mars.

Overall, NASA is an important space project that is honest and truthful about their work. They prove their claims with scientific facts and photos. They have the brains, tools, and budget that allows them to do that. If the public is not happy with their results they will find a different way to show it and find more evidence that will satisfy them.",0
"In recent years, the rise of renewable energy sources has been increasingly debated in American homes and workplaces. With the increase in global temperatures and an increasing awareness for sustainable living practices, many individuals are beginning to consider how they can incorporate renewable energy into their lives. While some may simply opt to install solar panels onto their roofs or purchase electric vehicles, other more ambitious individuals seek to power entire households with renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and geothermal heat pumps. When done correctly, utilizing these alternative energy systems can provide significant savings on electricity bills while also having a positive impact on the environment. The installation of a home-based renewable energy system is no easy task; however, it does have its rewards when completed successfully. For starters, homeowners benefit from lower electricity costs due to reduced reliance on grid-dependent power sources such as coal or natural gas plants. Further incentive comes with eligible tax credits offered by both state and federal governments that further reduce financial strain associated with installing such equipment while also providing potential future cost savings over time when compared against traditional utility providers’ prices increases over time. In addition to cost savings, there are environmental benefits associated with powering one’s home via clean green resources like wind turbines or geothermal heat pumps which help reduce carbon emissions leading up toward overall sustainability goals. This type of setup allows those interested in being conscious about their daily usage choices without sacrificing comfort—as long as proper engineering advice is taken during planning stages—in order to obtain optimal performance from the chosen system(s). . Although transitioning away from traditional fossil fuel based solutions towards cleaner alternatives may seem daunting at first glance; hopefully this overview provides insight into why today’s homeowner should seriously consider investing in a home-based renewable energy system for greater economic stability along with improved environmental conservation activities that will ultimately lead us all toward a healthier future lifestyle for our communities at large worldwide!",1
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. These examples include, less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. There is less stress because you are always tense as stated in the first source. There's cleaner air because cars are one of the leading causes to air pollution as said in source two. There's also more safety because streets don't have as much traffic stated on source three and four.

One benefit of limiting car usage is that there is less stress. There is less stress because when you own a car you may find yourself tense a lot of the time or maybe all of the time. In source one, Hedrium Walter stated that she was always tense with a car and now she is much happier. Bike riding and walking outside can be relieving without the sound of motors, hearing the children play in the park and breathing the fresh air is much better. In source three Carlos Arturo Plaza said that car free day is a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution. This is another instance of someone supporting limiting car usage because there is less stress.

Cleaner air is another benefit to limiting car usage. Cars are one of the leading factors to air pollution, this is shown in source two. In source two, it states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France afer fivedays of intensifying smog. This proves that limiting car usage provides cleaner air for the environment. With cleaner air, there is a healthier population which is a benefit to limiting the usage of vehicles.

There is more safety with limiting car usage. If car usage is limited, then there aren't as many car accidents and there is less traffic. Less traffic could also lead to public transportation becoming more efficient and faster. The bus would be able to get to places much faster without other cars being in the way with would be a benefit to limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage would be for the better of the population. It would cause less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. The usage of cars should be limited for the better of man and it should happen everywhere.",0
"The history of the daguerreotype is an interesting and unique topic that often goes overlooked. The daguerreotype was the first practical form of photography and was invented by French inventor, Louis Daguerre in 1839. It provided a method for capturing incredibly detailed images on polished silver plates using a camera obscura or a pinhole camera. Though its invention brought about great advancements in art and communication during the 19th century, it had some major limitations. Due to long exposure times, most pictures taken were still life portraits with no people in them as they could not stay still enough without blurring the image. Additionally, since this process used expensive materials such as silver-plated copper sheets and iodine fumes to develop images, only those who could afford such processes would have access to this new technology. Despite these issues, there are many beautiful examples of daguerreotypes throughout history due to their high contrast ratio which gave photos an excellent level of detail similar to what we’d see from modern photographs today (though significantly more grainy). For instance, one famous example is John Quincy Adams' 1843-44 daguerreotype portrait which depicted him sitting at his desk wearing glasses-- making it perhaps one of earliest known photographs featuring someone wearing glasses!. 	In addition to portraiture work done with this technique - landscape photography also began to emerge towards the end of this era thanks largely due Boulevard du Temple's industry-shifting photo taken by Louis Daguerer himself back in 1838 -- showcasing pedestrians strolling down Paris’s main boulevard while horse carts whizzed past! This photograph showed how much potential was possible within photography despite its primitive nature at that time period; something very few other techniques achieved before then. . Overall, though there are many criticisms associated with early forms of photography like the dagerrotype - here we can clearly observe that even during its infancy stage - photographic",1
"It is undeniable that the concept of sustainability has become increasingly important in our society. Not only does sustainable living allow us to enjoy the benefits of a healthy environment, it also encourages us to make conscious decisions about how we use and conserve natural resources. As climate change continues to be one of the most pressing issues facing humanity today, individuals must consider their own contribution towards making lifestyle changes that promote sustainability. One small but significant step towards achieving this goal is utilizing eco-friendly cleaning products for household chores such as dishwashing or laundry. Such products are manufactured with ingredients designed to reduce the negative environmental impact caused by conventional cleaners which contain destructive chemicals that can pollute water sources and other ecosystems when disposed into drains or sewage systems after usage. Additionally, many of these green detergents are biodegradable meaning they will not cause any harm even when washed down into bodies of water with rainwater runoff from residences. Furthermore, due to their components being derived from renewable crops like corn or sugarcane; manufacturing processes involve less energy expenditure than traditional cleaning supplies thus reducing carbon emissions too!. Apart from this there are several other steps an individual can take in order ensure more sustainable practices at home such as limiting single use plastics items and opting for reusable bottles instead while shopping; investing on energy efficient appliances (including light bulbs); eating more plant based foods; composting leftovers etcetera. Ultimately though its crucial remember that every effort made towards promoting sustainability no matter how small counts--and moreover if each person takes responsibility individually then together we could collectively create a much better future!",1
"Today majority of humans own or use a cell phone.

Most people may use it on a daily basis, when they at work, school, and home.

of people are distracted while driving. They may not understand how serious it is driving while being on your phone can not only injury others but you can be in bad shape to. A phone notification is not worth taking someone's life or injuring someone. It's other ways people can check their phone notification.

Things people can do to prevent them from getting in a accident while being on their phone while driving. They can use a google voice device to help send messages. Also they can bluetooth their phone to their car to answer calls. This can be a big help and much safer for drivers. Most people would be less distracted now.

Overall, people should not operate their phones while driving. A cell phone notification is not that important than driving on the road. Anyone can be seriously injury by cell phone distraction so therefore it's not safe. It can be safer ways people can see their phone nonfiction. Driving can be much safer without operating a phone.",0
"In the article, I think that the image of the face on Mars is just a landform. The NASA workers think that that the face was created by aliens. I don't think it is so.

When it says in the article The camera on the board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. From the image they took, I don't see anything that has to do with aliens, and if they think the holes and landforms are made from aliens, well they are not because one aliens don't exist, and two holes can be their because of meteroids. Also how I think the face is a natural landform, the mount next to it doesn't look like a face. It just looks like a regular, normal landform, or it could of been from a meteroid that fell. If they think that aliens made those mount, they need to prove it with images of the rover going around Mars, because what they are saying about the holes and the face hasn't fased me one bit.

On the top image of the article, it shows the images throughout the years of 1976 (left), 1998 (middle), and 2001 (right). The first image of 1976 which was taken by Viking 1 does look like a face at first, but you never know, they probably used a camera that wasn't really good, and the image was blurry. I think that is why the landform looks like a face. The second image of 1998 which was taken by Viking 2 is a little more clear, but also still looks like a face, but it is starting to fade away, the nose, mouth, and eyes. The third image of 2001 which was taken by NASA does not look like a face at all. The landform has all kinds of cracks, and lines on the mount.

With the images, in the article is says Twenty Five years ago something funny happened around Mars. So that was twenty five years ago when they took that photo, so that proves that in that time, they didn't have all kinds of cool techology to take photos that are really clear. Unlike in 2001, they had really good technology to take clear images to take a photo of the mount or whatever you think it is.

When they say that the aliens made the Face, you might not want to go with it because they might research it, but they also might assume what it is right away. And how they thought it was a face in 1976, they might of not had good technology in the 1900s. And they still believed it when they took the 2001 picture, and they even have good technology now. I don't know if they still believe it now, but if they do, that is suprising me.

When people put anything online about how they think it something, don't believe it until you see it yourselve. Either on the computer, or a book. But you don't have to go with what everyone is saying just because they think it is that, go look it up yourself, and if you don't think the image is compared to what they think the image is. That doesn't matter if you think different, it is who you are and what your imagination tells you what the object, image, color, etc. That is what makes you special in your own way.",0
"Plagiarism is an ever-growing problem in the world of academics. In recent years, technological advancements have made it easier than ever to copy and paste information from the internet into research essays or other assignments. Unfortunately, this act of academic dishonesty has negative consequences both for those who engage in plagiarism and for academic institutions as a whole. At its most basic level, plagiarism is defined as using someone else's words or ideas without crediting that individual or source. It occurs when students submit work they did not personally create; occasionally these works are copied or adapted verbatim from online sources such as articles and websites without proper citation. Interestingly enough, even unintentional acts can be labeled as plagiarism if proper citation is not employed. The effects of plagiarism on a student’s academic career can be severe depending on the institution’s policies regarding cheating and dishonesty - including suspension or expulsion from school . Additionally, engaging in this form of intellectual fraud can damage one's professional reputation long after graduating due to employers being able to access transcripts with evidence of wrongdoing. As such, avoiding any forms of academic dishonesty including plagiarizing should always be top priority for students looking to succeed academically and professionally going forward. In addition to having potentially devastating consequences on individuals found guilty of plagiarising their work , educational institutions themselves also suffer adverse effects due to high levels of cheating incidents within their environment . For example , when universities face public scrutiny due to multiple reports involving cases where students hand in fraudulent papers they are forced defend the integrity their programs while simultaneously trying ensure that all submitted papers meet reasonable standards authenticity . Moreover , scandals like these can result decreased enrollment which will consequently lead fewer tuition revenue affecting bottom line institution’s financial health overall . . Overall, it should go without saying that understanding what constitutes as plagiarism and how best avoid it important skill that must be mastered by every student prior entering postsecondary education system order preserve both",1
"Degree certificates are widely recognized as a measure of one's academic achievements and knowledge. However, if this tendency goes to the extreme, young people may be misled into believing that a degree certificate is the only factor that determines their success in life.

To begin with, a degree certificate is not a reliable indicator of one's ability to perform in the workplace. It is true that a degree certificate can demonstrate one's academic achievements, but it cannot reflect one's practical skills, such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. These skills are essential for success in the workplace, and they cannot be acquired through academic studies alone. For example, a person who has a degree in engineering may not be able to perform well in the workplace if he or she lacks the necessary practical skills.

Furthermore, a degree certificate does not guarantee success in life. It is true that having a degree can open doors to many opportunities, but it does not guarantee success. A person may have a degree, but he or she may still fail to achieve success due to other factors, such as lack of experience, poor networking skills, or lack of motivation. For example, a person who has a degree in business may not be able to find a job if he or she lacks the necessary experience or networking skills.

In conclusion, while a degree certificate can be a useful indicator of one's academic achievements, it is not the only factor that determines one's success in life. A degree certificate cannot reflect one's practical skills or guarantee success in life. Therefore, young people should not be misled into believing that a degree certificate is the only factor that determines their success in life.",1
"Voting for a President is an extremely big deal and needs to be decided properly. People argue the subject that the Electoral College is unfair opposed to an election that is held by popular vote. However, I disagree. The Electoral College is a process in which the most popular vote gets decided on and goes to Congress for the approval. Voting for a president is a big deal, especially when the decision is sealed for four years. The Electoral College has had people question it due to its inncodent in 2000 but overall, it is the best voting option.

Many citizens believe that when they vote that is the final process, no other decisions need to be made, but they are wrong. When qualified citizens vote for a president they also help choose their state's electors. The Electoral College process includes the selection of electors, the vote between who should be President or Vice President and then sent to Congress. Many people argue that the process of the Electoral College is unfair because the electors decide, not the citizens. What people dont understand is the Electoral College are actually deciding for us and thats what makes voters iffy. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote for the electors that actually decide who the president will be. Plumer, 10 The issue that gets faced to the voting citizens is they cant control whom their electors vote for. This can be an issue because of whats known as the disaster factor. Plumer, 11. The most known disaster factor was the big election crisis of 2000. The 2000 campaign was not held very properly, infact seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. People say that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational but in all actuality it is the best way to vote for who will become president. Bob Dole made the comment Abolish the Electoral College! but if we had just a popular vote, without Congress having a say in the decision, the process wouldnt be as organized.

In the year 2000 the Electoral College faced a big issue with the fairness of the voting process. At the time Al Gore and George W. Bush were running for president but Bush won receiving 271 electoral votes and Gore 266. Plumer, 1 This made citizens furious because they saw the Electoral College being unfair to voters. Despite that particular campaign, the Electoral College has not shown much faults. All in all the Electoral College process gets the decisons made faster and more efficenty opposed to if it was just by the overall most popular vote.

The argument of the Electoral College method of choosing their president and loosing voters is very popular. Voters knowning their vote will not have any effect, the less voters choose to participate and listen to the campaign. But in all actuality one voters vote will not swich or make the election any different, that is why we have the Electoral College. The Electors make the decison for us, taking the most popular votes and looking them over putting in their extra votes. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election Posner, 23. Despite the negative views on the Electoral College, it is actually the most organized fair voting process.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as promote healthier lifestyles and more sustainable communities. This essay will explore these advantages in more detail.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. According to the passage set, passenger cars in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, we can lower these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. For example, in the article Paris bans driving due to smog, a partial driving ban was enforced in Paris to combat smog caused by car emissions. As a result, congestion decreased by 60 percent and air quality improved.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage The End of Car Culture mentions that transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States, after power plants. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution and improve public health. In the example of Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents report being happier and less tense without the need to rely on cars for transportation. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to overall well-being and improved quality of life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier lifestyles. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in physical activity, such as walking or cycling. In the passage Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day. This event aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. By encouraging active modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, individuals can improve their physical fitness and reduce the risk of health problems associated with sedentary lifestyles.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable communities. The passage In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars describes how the community of Vauban in Germany is an example of smart planning to separate suburban life from car use. This concept is being adopted globally to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. By placing stores within walking distance and promoting public transportation, communities can reduce the need for cars, decrease traffic congestion, and create more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more sustainable communities. The examples provided in the passage set demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage in various contexts. To achieve these advantages, it is essential to prioritize alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, and to plan communities that support these options.",1
"The Face On Mars

Have you ever seen something crazy on something, maybe a face or something that you seen before? Have you thought about how that face or something else has gotten there? Well, for a start it defintley wasn't aliens! Just like the face on mars, people belive that the face was created by aliens! But that isn't true, the face on mars is just and only a natural landform that some how was created on earth.

For my first reason on why the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because NASA later revelied that the face was not made of aliens, but by shadows. A few days after that image was found, NASA needed to take a look and figure out what made this incredible and scientififc picture so unique, and why and how it was formed. Later on, they have came up with an good explaination about this unique image. NASA said this,huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Scientifically, the face was made from a natural cause, so it makes it a very different natural landform.

Now, for my second reason on why this was not made by aliens, but just a natural landform is that there is no scientific research showing that aliens do exist and created this face. Now I do know that some people say that they have seen aliens, but scientists dont think that is one hundred percent true because they don't have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real. Many people to belive in them, but how do we know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge? But now after NASA did some research, they found out that even though we don't have information about them, aliens did not create that face, it was only a natural landform.

For my third and final reason, why the face was not created by aliens and is only a natural landform , is because in the last paragraph,paragraph twelve, they talk about how the the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. Since the landform shows a butte or mesa, that means that the image was a major landform that came from the American West. Garvin says, It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also said, That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. So, this is not only a natural landform, but a major natural landform.

I do agree a little bit about aliens creating the face. Maybesomewhere in space, there are aliens that created something else or not. One day maybe we can find something out in space that has something to do with aliens, but today is just isn't the day to do that. But overall, i would have to agree that aliens did not create this, but this is only a natural landform created by something other than aliens.

As you can see, this creative landform was most defintley not created from aliens, but just a nice natural landform. Scientists now figured out that this Face on Mars is from shadows and not from aliens. This landform is actually a butte or a mesa which is very intersting to have found out. Many people did belive that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, but scientists haven't found out if there are aliens or not, so we shouldn't jump into conclusion. But overall, this face was defintely a landform and not created by aliens!!",0
"Education is an essential element of personal growth and can take on many forms, from formal schooling to self-guided learning. Whether you agree that education is a life-long process or not depends largely on your definition of education. As a general concept, I believe that education is indeed a life-long process.

The most obvious form of life-long education is formal schooling. As one progresses through education, the amount of “classroom” learning increases in complexity and depth; the individual is continually expanding their knowledge and exploring new ideas. Even after one’s formal education is completed, there will be times where continued education is essential in order to maintain or advance a career. As an example of this, I recently completed an online course in order to be certified in a certain software. This type of certification is necessary for many areas of the corporate world and as such, I was required to “refresh” my knowledge on a regular basis.

Another form of life-long education is the informal learning one acquires through daily life experiences. This type of learning is often overlooked, but can be just as important as formal schooling. Through life experiences, one develops skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, and communication. These skills are essential for navigating our lives and as such, can be seen as a type of education.

Finally, self-guided learning is another form of education that can take place throughout one’s life. This type of learning is often undertaken when one has an interest in a particular subject and they use available resources to learn more about it. Self-guided learning can range from the casual pursuit of knowledge to more focused study, such as a hobby or passion.

In conclusion, I believe that education is a life-long process. Formal education, informal learning, and self-guided learning all play a role in our continual pursuit for knowledge. As such, it is essential that we embrace the idea of a life-long education in order to continue to develop and grow.",1
"Why does this country even have this system? Where someone else basically chooses for you? The Electoral College should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This should change because the people have the right to have their opinion go to what is being voted on,not some else choice also because it's like people are voting for something they don't want foresfuly.  The United States is a what we call a democracy meaning the country is lead by the power of the people.

So when two people have an idea to make something better and another person has a different idea they each want to others to hear their ideas. Each person will have their reasons on why they think the way the way they think and the peolpe will have to make a desicion on what the they think is best for their community and their country. The United States is a democracy which means it is lead by the people. It's the people say. So when someone votes they expect their vote count against what they are going for. You making a desicion and someone else who is higher than you changes it makes voting ironic. Why vote? Just make them do the whole election. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president(Plumer). So technacally we are not doing the voting we are just what is called giving options to those who are actually doing the voting. We the people demand to be heard and want what we want. In

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong it states that over sixty percent  of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Point being be should be heard no matter what.

In the United States we are not forced to do anything really. Especially when it comes to choosing. Everybody thinks differently so why should someone else vote for the choice of the people. It's like we are voting for someone we don't want when someone higher that you is voting for you. Each stae has their own number of electoral votes but it shouldn't be that way because it the president your voting for is in a tie and he need those votes the people would know that their votes are helping the person they want to see win. But when the electors choose something else the people cant think that. Sometime the electors refuse to vote for the their party's canidate. which makes the situation even terrible.

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong paragraph 11 it says Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever the please. So why even waste time on telling people to vote if someone else will choose for you sometimes not what you want.

In the end having to count so many votes could be dificult and when counting it could lead to mistakenly counted. But we the people make our own desion for our own good. Just imagine someone asks you what you want to eat and get you something totally different.",0
"The Natural Face

The Face is just a natural landform. I work as a scientist at NASA, and I know that the image taken of the face was not created by aliens. The article, Unmasking the Face on Mars, tells how the truth is revealed. I can prove that the Face is just a landform and not some superstitious icon.

First of all, back in 1976, the quality of pictures and images probably aren't going to be that outstanding. The pictures are blurry and they are the first documented pictures of that landform. I know this because paragraph seven states,  And so on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Later in paragraph seven, the text says,

There was no alien monument after all. This is why the Viking's pictures aren't credible sources, and that people shouldn't trust the Face in that picture.

Now, some might say, back then, that the alien markings are hidden by the haze. The text in paragraph eight says why,The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. However, later pictures still prove that the alien creation was not real.

The MGS images prove that the Face is just another landform on Mars. This is because the MGS was able to get another photo. Paragraph 10 states, Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. At a moment like that, the time for taking a picture is perfect.

To add on to that cloudless day, the photo taken is eaxtroardinary. In paragraph 10 Garvin says, Malin's team captured an extroardinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. The paragraph also states, Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. The quality is exceptionally clearer than the picture taken in 1976. The cracks and clear image show that there aren't any aliens, but that the Face is nothing but a huge rock formation.

In conclusion, the Face is just a rock formation on Mars. Back in 1976, the quality of pictures weren't that great. Through time though, the quality of pictures did get better, and the MGS was able to take a picture of the Face on April 8th, 2001, showing that it was a rock, or, The Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West, as paragraph 12 says. The Face is a landform, not an alien creation.",0
"Dear State senator, The Electoral college is a process that was established by our founding fathers in a constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.The electoral college consists of the selection of the electors then that carries into the meeting or gathering of the electors.In that type of meeting of the electors they vote for the president and the vice president,Next is the counting of the electoral votes by congress.The electoral college consists of 538 electors,Did you know that a majority of those electors votes are required to elect the president.Well 270 electoral votes to be exact.Well how did the number of electoral get chosen? The way that exact number got chosen is because there is one electoral to each member in the House of Representatives.Don't you agree that that was a wise choice? Also dont you think that our founding fathers really sat back and but real thought and effort in to a decision like this,something to put into the constitution.

Personally,I believe that the electoral College should be kept in place and not depend on a popular vote to elect our president,for two reasons.The first reason is because most people who are about to vote they dont actually sit and take the time to see who they are voting for,they just christmas tree all of the options that they have. The second reason why i believe that i believe that the electoral college should stay in place because that this is a good process to have in place.

How many people do you think actually sit there and research and put thought into the president that they are chosing to run their country? Do you really believe that everyone does that? Think about the young and inexperienced voters who are fresh out of highschool and probably just getting into college,Do you think that on top of their school work that they'll sit there and add something else on to their plate? To be completly honest i would not. I would either not vote or just pick at a random.Many people have a family and a job or jobs and have alot on their plate so the last thing they're gonna do is take the time out of their busy schedules and researchand find information on something that they dont need to do.

I also believe that the electoral college should stay in place because it's a good process to have. Having the electoral college in effect takes the stress off of the voters so they can continue on with their busy lives and not have to stand in those unreasonably long lines in the cold,hot,rain, or even snow. The people workers out in those lines are irritable and dont want to be there along with the voters,They look at it as a a waist of their time. No one likes to feel like their time was waisted because Time is Money.

I hope you actually get this letter,read it,and but thought into what you just read.The Electoral college is a very good process to have in effect. Remeber that it keeps peole stress free and less irritable and if you use the Electors and not citizens you will end up getting a more educated vote because they sat back and analyzed the actions from the past of each canadate that is running and is making a vote based off of knowledge,not picking at a random.",0
"Code]

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my thoughts and support for the continuation of the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States, despite the growing calls for a change to a popular vote system. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully examined various texts on the topic, including the What Is the Electoral College? article from the Office of the Federal Register, the The Indefensible Electoral College op-ed by Bradford Plumer, and the In Defense of the Electoral College article by Judge Richard A. Posner. Based on the evidence presented in these texts, I believe that retaining the Electoral College is in the best interest of our nation.

One key argument in favor of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome in presidential elections. As Judge Posner points out, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This system ensures that a candidate must have a broad appeal across multiple regions rather than relying solely on the popular vote. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional support, the Electoral College promotes a more inclusive democracy and ensures that the interests of all regions of the country are considered.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its promotion of swing states as an important focus during election campaigns. Posner argues that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to direct their efforts towards undecided states. This approach compels candidates to engage with a wider range of voters and gain a deeper understanding of their concerns and priorities. Consequently, swing states receive greater attention and more comprehensive campaign efforts, leading to a more informed electorate and a heightened level of political discourse.

The Electoral College also serves as a balancing mechanism by giving greater weight to larger states. Posner asserts that the Electoral College restores some of the political balance that larger states lose due to the apportionment of the Senate. This balance ensures that presidential candidates must be mindful of the interests and needs of both densely and sparsely populated states. By giving all states, regardless of size, a voice in the election process, the Electoral College fosters a sense of unity and fairness among states with varying populations and political ideologies.

Moreover, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. Posner emphasizes that the Electoral College often produces a clear winner, minimizing the risk of a prolonged and complicated election process. This stability is crucial for maintaining the continuity and effectiveness of our democratic system. Run-off elections can be time-consuming, expensive, and potentially divisive. The Electoral College spares the nation from such complications by providing a definitive outcome in a timely manner.

While critics argue that the Electoral College diminishes the influence of individuals who reside in states dominated by a single party, the evidence suggests that voter turnout is not significantly affected by this factor. As Posner points out, about half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite the knowledge that their individual vote may not sway the national outcome. Voters are driven by their desire to express a political preference rather than the belief that their vote will be the deciding factor. Therefore, concerns over voter participation due to the Electoral College seem largely unfounded.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, although imperfect, strikes a balance between ensuring a fair and inclusive democracy and maintaining stability and certainty in presidential elections. It guarantees that candidates must have broad support across multiple regions, gives swing states the attention they deserve, provides a voice to all states regardless of size, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While calls for change should always be considered, it is essential to recognize the valuable role the Electoral College plays in our democratic process.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system and to resist calls for a change to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Scientific Pursuit

The article The Challenge of Exploring Venus makes a compelling case that studying Venus is a worthy scientific endeavor, despite the extreme dangers its environment presents. The author effectively supports this claim with several key pieces of evidence. 

First, the author notes Venus' similarities to Earth in size and composition, suggesting it may provide insight into how Earth evolved differently with a livable climate. Understanding worlds both similar yet vastly different can deepen our knowledge of planetary formation and evolution. The article also points out that Venus is the closest planet to study processes like atmospheric circulation and volcanism up close. Its proximity allows for less expensive missions that can return high-quality data. 

While conditions on Venus' surface could destroy spacecraft and probes in mere hours, the article details recent technological advances that have enabled more durable materials and design. Past successful missions have returned invaluable observations, increasing our knowledge about Venus and advancing spacecraft engineering. Future planned orbiter and lander missions aim to build on this progress with more robust probes. The potential scientific discoveries clearly outweigh the risks, according to evidence presented.

In conclusion, the author makes a persuasive case that exploring Venus remains a scientifically worthy goal despite its hazards. Venus offers a unique opportunity to study an Earth-like planet and better understand our own world and others. Advancing technologies also mitigate dangers, allowing more durable missions. With its compelling evidence of the scientific importance and feasibility of Venus exploration, the article effectively supports its claim that such research is valuable despite the challenges. Studying Venus can significantly expand human knowledge with rewards justifying reasonable risks.",1
"There is no doubt that a graduate degree is a valuable credential, and it can be a strong indicator of a person's ability to succeed in a career. However, there are also many other important abilities and qualities that can be valuable in a career, and a degree certificate cannot always reflect all of them. For example, a degree certificate may not reflect a person's skills in communication, problem solving, or leadership.

Critics of this trend argue that, if too many decisions are based on a person's degree certificate, young people may be misled. They may think that a degree is the only important thing, and that it is the only way to achieve success in a career. This could lead to young people neglecting other important abilities and qualities, and it could also lead to them not being able to find a successful career because they do not have the right skills.

I believe that, overall, degree certificates are a valuable indicator of a person's academic achievements. However, I also believe that they should not be the only indicator of a person's ability to succeed in a career. There are many other important abilities and qualities that a person can have, and a degree certificate cannot always reflect all of them. This could lead to young people being misled, and it could also lead to them not being able to find a successful career because they do not have the right skills.",1
"I agree with successful people who try new things and take risks. This is because it is important to be constantly learning and expanding one's knowledge. By trying new things, one is able to learn new skills and strategies, which can then be put to use in the future. For example, if someone is a successful accountant, they may want to learn accounting software in order to improve their efficiency. However, if they only use the same software that they have been using for years, they may not be as efficient as they could be. It is important to take risks and try new things in order to grow and learn.",1
"Reform is a process aimed at improving an institution, system or process. It is often associated with initiating change and correcting perceived flaws or problems. However, the process of reform often requires a willingness to be viewed with disdain by the rest of the world. While some may see this as an obstacle, I strongly believe that it is a necessary step towards achieving meaningful reform.

Firstly, those who are truly invested in reforming an institution or system must be willing to challenge the status quo. This often requires going against prevailing norms and opinions. For example, in the 1960s, civil rights activists in the United States challenged the entrenched racism and segregation that existed at the time. They were met with intense opposition and scorn from many segments of society. However, they persisted in their efforts and eventually brought about significant change.

Similarly, in many countries, individuals and groups have struggled to bring about political reform. This often involves challenging entrenched power structures and the interests of the ruling elite. In such cases, it is almost certain that those involved in the reform movement will be viewed with disdain or even hostility by the rest of the world. However, it is only by being willing to endure this kind of criticism that meaningful change can be achieved.

Secondly, those who are serious about reform must often be willing to take personal risks. This could involve putting one's own reputation and social standing on the line. For example, whistleblowers who expose corruption or wrongdoing are often viewed as traitors by those in power. They risk losing their jobs, friends, and even their freedom. Yet, they take these risks because they believe that the benefits of exposing wrongdoing outweigh the costs.

Similarly, those who advocate for reform in repressive regimes often risk their lives. In many countries, activists who speak out against human rights abuses, corruption or other forms of oppression are subject to harassment, imprisonment, and even torture. In such cases, the willingness to endure such risks is crucial to the success of the reform movement.

Lastly, those who are serious about reform must be willing to accept that progress may be slow and difficult. Change often takes time and requires a sustained effort over many years. Those who are not willing to accept this reality are unlikely to succeed in bringing about meaningful change. For example, the struggle for women's rights in many countries has been a long and difficult process. It has involved sustained efforts over many decades, and progress has often been slow. However, those who have remained committed to the cause have eventually succeeded in achieving significant gains.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that those who are serious about reforming institutions, systems, or processes must be willing to endure criticism, take risks, and accept that progress may be slow. While it may be difficult to be viewed with disdain by the rest of the world, it is a necessary step towards achieving meaningful change. The history of reform movements shows that those who are committed to their cause and are willing to endure these challenges are the ones who ultimately succeed in bringing about lasting change.",1
"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents becasue people are intrested in how the solar system works today. Venus can be very intresting if it's something you like to learn about. As the Article says On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experience on our own planet. Knowing we couldn't go there maybe people lose intrest in the planet, but there's a lot more to learn about it. There are some positive things about the planet that you might know or maybe you could learn. Venus is one of the hottest plantes we haveand it could be very dangrous, but it also has some futures just like earth does.

Venus is the second planet from the sun and knowing that it's so close must mean that it really is hot. But also, as i have said it's really simmular to Earth. As is says in the article It may have well been the most Earth-like planet. Also they have said that Venus has some feature that are just like earth The planet has a suface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features like valleys, moutains, and craters. Knowing a little about Venus you have so much more to learn.

If your looking a Venus from a far because you can't go on it, and neither could the spaceships...you can't really get a good look at the ground or the planet itself. So there may be something else that's intresting about venus that we don't know yet. As I have read in the text it was saying that NASA is working on new ways to study venus. NASA has always found a way to create something that will last on the planets that we want to explore. Venus is intrestiong because it so hot even some of the objects they want to use they can't.

Reading about venus I have learned a lot, like venus is one of the brightestv points in the sky and when it gets dark you coould see it. Something new as the article says they are trying to figure out whats strong enough to last in venus's conditions. Today they use powerful computers, as it says in the article Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible and quick.

Today they are learing new ways and soon you'll know more about Venus.",0

Dont believe this because its slightly untrue because if you believe that aliens are real then of course your going to believe that aliens have came and put this face on mars.

"Thomas Jefferson wrote,Determine never to be idle...Its is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose?

The way you determine to do things is pushing yourself to do it, nobody gonna be there to tell you, when you gotta get your stuff done. We the people shouldn't be idle at all ,it would be boring ,not doing anything like just relax at home,and get fat on the couch,being lazy from time, to time isn't as bad. Also you want to have a break,so you won't stress out as much. Most people are determine to be inactivity and will get upset or,have a panic attack,health issues,It can affect your life to be honest ,and it sucks! that's how life is,it gets harder,and harder and you need to motivate yourself, makes your mind stronger. People who don't motivate themselves they got to at least try to get things done, and it never gets any easier....you just got to do it like this essay;I'm writing.

An inactivity does serve a purpose based on people who don't accomplish much by being lazy and not realizing how the situation can get worse instead of getting it done on time. People got to be always doing something ,and be well organized,it will also be wonderful too see people not being idle too always be doing something,so they would feel good about themselves and be like Yes! I did it!and that way they won't have to deal with it anymore ,and move on with their day,just like anybody should. In order too always do something you should just look for something you like to do,to keep yourself busy like: playing soccer, working out ,rather not doing anything ,and just being on your phone on social media.

In my opinion being be responsible and accomplishing is a whole relief ,and taking your time getting stuff done can also help to focus.

For us kids our responsibility is to get good grades in school, and graduate,be successful in life to become better than what our parents were,or be a better person by being active and helping a church out .People sometimes need emotional support because everybody is different, everybody handles their attitude,or situations differently,and they might be going through something and it will affect their life. Taking a position of where I stand in school is me failing tests because,I don't study and I know,I should study but when I try too, I forget ,and forget the next day ,and I hate that, I know ,I can pass my tests ,and get better grades, if I studied this is one of my accomplishment I need to work on.

Thomas Jefferson wrote that because, he wants to motivate people to accomplish more by doing things and finding a job, and work hard,by being successful. Thomas Jefferson also did some things,He wrote the Deceleration Of Independence,he is one of the Founding Fathers and accomplished being our President.

There are lots of people in this world with different point of views of how they accomplish of always doing something,people try to plan out ideas to see what will work out for them, and help them think harder based on how they handle what works for them because,their is plenty of strategies in the world people can use to do something,what makes them feel more comfortable .It is very important for people to accomplish things that they need to do to get it off their hands and help each other out, if they need help ,and not stress about it but,most things you can't depend on someone being their,you got to do it on your own ,and if your stressing about it, you just got to relax your mind ,take yoga if you have too! but than again everybody is different and at least you need to try because,if you dont do that than where do you think your set of accomplishments is gonna go?.",0
"There is no doubt that educating girls has a ripple effect that extends far beyond the individual girl herself. When a girl receives an education, she is more likely to marry later, have fewer and healthier children, and ensure that her own children also receive an education. Educated girls also tend to be more productive members of their communities and contribute more to their countries' economies.

For example, in Malawi, girls who have completed secondary school are more than twice as likely to be employed as girls who have not completed secondary school. They are also more likely to start their own businesses. And when girls have access to education, they are more likely to speak out against injustices such as child marriage and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).

There are many reasons why educating girls has such a profound impact on families and nations. For one, girls who receive an education are more likely to marry later. This means they will have more time to invest in their own education and also in their children's education. A girl who is educated also tends to have healthier children. This is because she is more likely to seek out medical care for herself and her children and to provide them with nutritious food.

Educated girls are also more likely to be productive members of their communities. They are more likely to volunteer their time and energy to help others. They are also more likely to be vocal about the issues that matter to them, such as child marriage and FGM. This increased activism can lead to positive change in their communities and countries.

Overall, it is clear that educating girls has a far-reaching impact on families and nations. When girls have access to education, they are more likely to be employed, have healthy children, and be productive members of their communities. They are also more likely to speak out about the issues that matter to them. This makes the world a better place for everyone.",1
"The importance of physical education in the modern world is undeniable. With an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, physical activity has become more important than ever before to ensure that people remain physically healthy and fit. Moreover, studies have shown that regular exercise can lead to improved mental health and well-being as well. Physical education provides both a foundation for lifelong fitness habits, while also teaching essential skills such as teamwork and problem solving which are beneficial in multiple areas of life. Physical education classes offer a great opportunity for students to engage with their peers in a collaborative environment centered around physical activity. Through organized sports, students learn how to work together towards shared goals while developing personal strengths and weaknesses along the way. Furthermore, it encourages problem solving through strategizing about how best to utilize team members’ particular skillsets in order achieve success on the field or court – potentially serving as a valuable lesson from which other areas of life may be approached similarly. Ultimately physical education is instrumental in helping young people grow into healthy adults who understand not only the value of keeping themselves active but also how working together helps them reach greater heights than going solo would allow for - all while having fun along the way! From this perspective it becomes clear why making sure that every student has access to quality physical education instruction is so important: not just because it promotes good health but because it teaches lessons which can benefit those same individuals throughout all stages of their lives both inside and outside school walls",1
"Title: Limiting Car Usage: A Case for Sustainable Urban Living

The dependence on cars as the primary mode of transportation, particularly in suburban life, has resulted in numerous adverse consequences such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbated traffic congestion. Countering this culture of car usage could significantly offset these issues. By examining the experiences of places like Vauban in Germany, Paris, Bogota in Colombia, and the United States, we can gain an informed perspective on the advantages of reducing our reliance on cars.

Vauban, Germany, offers a compelling case study. In this experimental district, residents have largely relinquished their cars, with 70% of families not owning a car and 57% selling theirs upon moving to the neighborhood (Rosenthal). The resulting urban design allows for residents to enjoy quieter, less polluted neighborhoods, while still having access to transportation infrastructure, such as trams for travel to city centers. 

Further, this transformed suburban life can meaningfully contribute to decreased greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, which currently contribute to up to 50% of these emissions in car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). This feature is particularly important as global cities endeavor to cut down emissions to mitigate climate change. 

A similar pro-change sentiment was depicted in Paris when a partial driving ban reduced pollution and traffic congestion by 60% (Duffer). Furthermore, other cities such as Bogota in Colombia have been able to foster alternative means of transportation, enhancing air quality and lowering stress levels of residents (Selsky).

A growing trend in the United States also suggests Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, aided by the advent of telecommuting, resurgence of city centers, and innovations in carpooling and car sharing (Rosenthal). These practices are likely not only to be environmentally beneficial but could also have implications for transportation and auto industries, prodding them into reinventing themselves as mobility companies focused on more sustainable solutions.

Despite these gains, shifts in the culture of car usage will be shaped substantially by how younger generations perceive car ownership and usage. Interestingly, findings depict a significant drop in the percentage of young individuals getting licensed to drive, hinting at unprecedented shifts in car culture (Rosenthal). 

To conclude, transitioning from a car-centric lifestyle provides numerous potential benefits, including environmental sustainability, improved health from diminished pollution, and potentially heightened social interactions from shared transportation. While challenges persist, the experiences of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the trend in the United States demonstrate that systemic changes are both attainable and beneficial for the urban life, the environment, and the broader society.",1
"Traveling is a wonderful experience that allows people to explore new places, learn about different cultures, and create unforgettable memories. However, when it comes to deciding how to travel, some people prefer to go on their own, while others prefer to join a group led by a tour guide. In my opinion, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel, and in this essay, I will explain why.

First of all, traveling in a group led by a tour guide offers many advantages in terms of convenience and safety. When you travel on your own, you have to plan everything yourself, from booking your flights and accommodations to finding your way around a new city. This can be time-consuming and stressful, especially if you are not familiar with the local language or customs. On the other hand, when you travel with a tour guide, everything is taken care of for you. The tour guide will arrange your transportation, accommodations, and activities, and will also provide you with valuable information about the places you visit. Moreover, traveling in a group is safer than traveling alone, as you are less likely to get lost or encounter dangerous situations.

Secondly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide allows you to learn more about the places you visit. A good tour guide is knowledgeable about the history, culture, and traditions of the places you visit, and can provide you with insights that you would not get on your own. For example, when I traveled to Japan with a tour group, our guide told us about the significance of the cherry blossom season and the etiquette of visiting a Japanese temple. Without her guidance, I would not have appreciated these aspects of Japanese culture as much.

Finally, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a great way to meet new people and make friends. When you travel on your own, you may feel lonely or isolated, especially if you are in a foreign country where you don't know anyone. However, when you travel with a group, you have the opportunity to interact with other travelers who share your interests and passions. This can lead to meaningful friendships and connections that can last long after the trip is over.

Of course, there are some disadvantages to traveling in a group led by a tour guide. For example, you may have less flexibility in terms of your itinerary, and you may have to follow a strict schedule. Moreover, you may have to deal with other people's personalities and preferences, which can be challenging at times. However, I believe that the advantages of traveling in a group outweigh the disadvantages, and that it is the best way to travel, especially if you are a first-time traveler or if you are visiting a new and unfamiliar destination.

In conclusion, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel, as it offers many advantages in terms of convenience, safety, learning, and socializing. Of course, everyone has their own preferences and needs, and some people may prefer to travel on their own. However, if you are looking for a hassle-free and enriching travel experience, I would highly recommend joining a tour group led by a knowledgeable and friendly guide.",1

"Is using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom the right thing to do? What does this type of technology help other students on? Can it help people comunicate with others in the world? Is forcing a fake smile a good thing or bad.

First, using the Facial Action Coding System to read students emotions during class is good because it can let the teacher know how they feel. For an example, if a student was taking a test or a quiz online and was slacking off or getting tired, the computer would switch the questions up until they find the right questions to ask when the student face expression chamges. While doing that, it helps them stay on track and not get bored that easily. The system recognize emotion by the every muscles on your face. This new envention even figured out how Mona Liza was feeling by just technology.

Next, can it help comunicate better in the real life world? By using this new Facial Action Coding System, Students can now study what kind of emotions are shown when talking to other people. What I trying to say is that, they can find out when they are fake smiling,laughing, or even interested in the conversation. One example on fake smiling is that is you can see the bottom and upper teeth at the same time, they are really not smiling but just smiling to not make anything wierd. If someone that you are taking with is not interested on the topic guys are talking about, you can notice by simpily looking into their eyes and if they are just looking anywhere besides making eye contact, they are not even paying attention to you.

Finally, making a fake smile, is that a good thing? According to the Facial Feedback, moving your face muscles to smiling not only expresses emotions, but they also helps your facial muscles produce them. By even smiling actually makes you happy. To me, being happy is the best, why not to other people. A drama coach by the name of Constantin Stanislavsky, made mostly all his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning to create their emotions on stage. Feeling someone else's emotion stage may happen because we are not used to seeing that.

By using technology to see how stuents are, is that the good thing to do or bad? Does this type of technology help students. Can the Facial Action Coding System help people comunicate with others in the world? Can fake smiling help people around the world?",0

"Driving using a phone?

When you are driving down the road and you get a phone call do you wait till you stop to answer it. Or do you answer immediately while your hands in the wheel. Do you think people should do that?

In my opinion i think people should not be able to use their phone but only on emergency. Have something to hold your phone up or a magnet on your dashboard. So if you get a call or text you dont grab and only using a finger and tap quick to answer it. Instead of grabbing it and putting it up to your ear. Doing that can prevent less crashes in my opinion because you you just give your phone a glance and a quick tap instead of holding it and trying to multi task looking at a phone and drive. By doing that you can be looking at the road and still give your phone a glance.

If you aren't allowed to use your on while driving. What happens if your wealthy businessman and you don't have anything bluetooth to talk to the person. How would you solve that problem but also that can be dangerous because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.

Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

People say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. But its a risk of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is Onstar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency they will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the nearest police, hospital and fire department giving them your exact location. Nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

In conclusion if people don't stop using phones while driving the percent in people dying in car crashes won't change.",0

"When you look for the right advise, do you only go to one person to get your answer? That may work sometimes, but most of the time, you won't get the best or most accurate opinion. You should keep in mind who you're talking to, because when you're talking to the wrong people, they might give you false information. It's important to talk to multiple people when looking for advise because hearing different opinions can help you make a better choice and when talking to only one person, they may not give the best advise.

Different opinions can help you narrow down your decision because if you only go to one person, you're only going to hear one thing, but the more people you talk to the better advise you'll receive. You should go to multiple people for opinions because you might not have even thought about what they said prior to talking to them. If you talk to more people for advise, the chances you are going to get good advise is higher than if you only talk to one person.

If one person gives you good advise, you may just stick to what they said and not talk to anyone else about it, but if you talk to multiple people you can get even better ideas about what you're trying to accomplish. It's easy to just go with what the first person tells you, but it's not always the right thing. If you really want good advise, go to multiple trusted people to hear what you're looking to hear. Now, you don't always have to go to your friends for help, but it's good to get someone else's option when trying to make an important decision.

When seeking advise, talking to multiple people can help you make a better decision because when you talk to more than one person, you're going to get better advise as oppose to talking to just one person. When you talk to multiple people, the chances of you getting better advise and making a better decision are higher than if you just talked to one person. When you ask a friend for his or her opinion, you might get a reasonable response, but you'll be better off talking to multiple people about whatever is happening. In conclusion, if you want good advise, you should talk to more than just one person because you will get better information and that will help you make a better decision.",0
"Countries like France, Columbia, Germany and USA have took part in reducing greenhouse gasses by reducing if not excluding vehicle transportation. Stats have shown less amounts of carbon in the air and less congestion in immense cities like Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia.

Source two states that Paris typically has more smog then other cities in Europe like Brussels and London. They're taking action by allowing evennumbered license plates to drive one day and have the oddnumbered license plates leave their cars at home and the same would apply to evennumbered plates the following day. Anyone against that restriction would be given a 22euro fine or 31 dollar fine. That method decreased smog and congestion by 60 percent.

Source three talks about the country of Bogota, Columbia. This town or city has took a big step into reducing gas emissions where not only they participate but other local towns and cities as well. They contribute by leaving their cars home all day for one day to reduce the amount of carbon and smog in the air which helps the environment.

"The Face on Mars is Simply a Natural Landform

Many people claim that the iconic landform seen in photographs taken by the Viking orbiter in 1976 shows evidence of ancient aliens on Mars. However, upon closer examination, it is clear that the Face on Mars is simply a chance formation created through natural geological processes over millions of years. 

One of the primary claims supporting the idea that the Face is natural is its lack of symmetry. If it were sculpted intentionally, we would expect basic symmetrical features like two eyes at the same height and distance from the center. However, the various apparent facial features are unevenly spaced and positioned at different elevations. The article also notes that subsequent higher resolution images show the face breaking up with no coherent structure. This asymmetric appearance supports it being a random collection of natural landforms rather than an intentionally designed sculpture.

Further evidence comes from erosion patterns seen around the Face. Craters and other impact scars indicate that wind and precipitation have gradually worn down the cliff and mesas surrounding it over vast timescales. The streaks and lines cut into the rock face look like the type of irregular patterns caused by natural weathering, not precise truncations that would imply artificial sculpting. The dimensions and composition of the landform are also consistent with being formed from the same sedimentary rock layers that make up the surrounding hills and mesas in the region. 

In conclusion, while the Face on Mars superficially resembles a human face to our pattern-recognizing brains, a careful analysis of the available data strongly suggests it is just a random, naturally-formed mountain seen from an angle that triggered our innate facial recognition systems. The asymmetries, uneven spacing, erosion patterns and composition of the landform all align with geological processes shaping the martian landscape over millions of years, not intricate carving by intelligent alien hands. The preponderance of evidence conclusively shows the Face on Mars was created through natural means rather than alien intervention.",1
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to urge you to reconsider our country's current use of the Electoral College system. After deep investigation and consideration, I have found that most voters, myself included, would instead prefer a direct election.

In our status quo, as established by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College process comprises of elector selection, meetings, and vote counting by Congress. Each state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of its Congressional delegation members. However, this process has its flaws, as stated by Bradford Plumer in his article, The Indefensible Electoral College. In his plight for a change to direct vote, he argues that the Electoral College system is both non-democratic and confusing, leading potentially to electoral disasters. In fact, electors have historically flouted public opinion and voted according to their own whim, which undermines democratic principles.

Opponents of the direct vote system argue that the Electoral College offers certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to have a trans-regional appeal, and ensures that more thoughtful voters will decide elections, as Judge Richard A. Posner pointed out in his essay In Defense of the Electoral College. While these are seemingly valuable benefits, they do not sufficiently counterbalance the principle of fairness that our democracy should uphold. More fundamentally, it does not sit well with a vast majority of people that someone can win the most popular votes and still lose the presidency. 

In addition, the Electoral College seems to exacerbate the gap between different states' political influence. As it stands, candidates tend to pay more attention to larger states and swing states, leaving lesser populous states feeling neglected, which contradicts the principle of equality that a democratic nation should cherish. Consequently, the system favors some voters over others, as Plumer explained. 

The arguments against the Electoral College system align more consistently with our democratic ideals than the arguments in favor of maintaining it. As the matters stand, the Electoral College system feels outdated and disjointed from the transformation our society has experienced since it was established. 

I appeal to you to advocate on our behalf to maintain our country's integrity by replacing this flawed system with a direct voting system, which would foster a more accurate representation of our citizenry in the election of our President.

Yours sincerely,

"The potential use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read student emotions in the classroom warrants consideration of both benefits and risks. On one hand, this technology could provide teachers valuable insights into how their lessons are engaging students on an emotional level. If a teacher notices many students appear bored or confused during a particular part of a lesson, FACS analysis could help identify where extra support is needed or how instruction may need to be modified to maximize learning. This data-driven approach may help educators continually improve their teaching methods. Additionally, for some students this technology could help teachers recognize early signs of emotional distress that could interfere with the learning process if left unaddressed. 

However, there are also significant privacy and social risks to consider. Continuous monitoring of student facial expressions risks transforming the classroom into more of a laboratory than a nurturing learning environment. Students may feel uncomfortable or judged knowing every subtle reaction is being analyzed. This could undermine building the trust between teacher and student that is important for learning. There is also a concern that out-of-context emotional readings could lead to incorrect assumptions about how students are processing information if other variables are not considered. Before implementing such technologies, thoughtful policies and parental consent would be needed to address privacy and ensure the emotional well-being of students remains the priority over data collection. Overall, while FACS may provide some insights, more traditional assessment methods centered around one-on-one interactions between teachers and students are likely better able to support the nuanced needs of the learning process.",1
"There is no doubt that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Broad knowledge allows people to see the big picture and understand complex ideas, while specialization often leads to tunnel vision and a lack of understanding of related topics.

One of the benefits of broad knowledge is that it makes people more versatile and able to solve problems. For example, a civil engineer who specializes in bridges might not be able to design a building, and a doctor who specializes in heart surgery might not be able to treat a patient with a broken arm. By contrast, a person with broad knowledge of many academic subjects would be able to solve a wider range of problems.

Another benefit of broad knowledge is that it makes people more creative and able to think outside the box. For example, a scientist who specializes in one specific area might not be able to come up with new ideas, but a scientist who has a broad knowledge of many different areas might be able to come up with new and innovative ideas.

Finally, a benefit of broad knowledge is that it allows people to communicate more effectively with others. For example, a doctor who specializes in heart surgery might not be able to communicate with a patient who has a broken arm, but a doctor who has a broad knowledge of many different subjects would be able to communicate with patients from all backgrounds.

In conclusion, it is clear that broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialization in one specific subject. Broad knowledge allows people to solve problems more effectively, think more creatively, and communicate more effectively with others.",1
"People feel a special connection to the outdoors that can't be found anywhere else. Visiting a park is a chance to explore the beauty of nature in an accessible and affordable way. In a park, one can find peace and relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. There are many activities available in the park - from taking a leisurely stroll to playing sports, to going on a picnic. Parks are also family-friendly and provide the perfect environment for children to learn and grow while having fun. Additionally, they often contain plenty of wildlife and natural scenery, which can help people to appreciate and understand the world around them. Furthermore, for those who live in urban environments, like cities, a park is often the closest place to go and experience the beauty of nature. All of these reasons make going to the park a wonderful and rewarding experience.",1
"Nonverbal communication is often used more than verbal. The way someone stands, moves, or sets their face can tell others more of what they feel then what they are told; however, these social cues aren't always understood. Technology is impacting the world greatly and the Facial Action Coding Software may seem like just another gadget, but it could change the way of teaching to specialize for individuals. Though the thought of computers identifying all emotions is slightly unsettling there are many benefits that may clome along with the software.

In schools, there are many students who struggle with the cirriculum because they do not understand the way it is being taught. From the teacher's point of view, it may look like they are not engaged because the aren't interested in learning the material. It may actually be because they are not understanding the material. A face that looks bored is usually a straight mouth and dull eyes, a confused face could look similar but with furrowed brows. There may not be a noticable difference between a bored face and a confused face that a teaher can spot especially while looking at many faces at a time.

According to the article, the software detects facial movements and compares them to a nutral face to calculate the percent of an emotion someone is feeling. Having this software in classroom computers could benefit both the students and the teachers in many ways. Along with modifying the lesson, the computers could collect data of how a student was reacting during an assignment or during a lecture and then notify the teacher or professor about the results. If many of the students are confused by what is being taught, the teacher could re-word the lectures in a way that might be more clear. If the students are becoming quickly bored of the material then the teacher may need to make some assgnment a little more challenging. The software can also show the teacher when students get exited about certain topics or when they are frightened by an assignment. When assignments are turned in and the result is bad grades, many teachers may assume that the student isn't trying their best, but there may be many other reasons why the work wasn't what was expected. With the facial action software, the teachers would be able to understand why the student didn't do the work properly. If they were confused then the teacher could suggest way to understand better, if the student was bored and didn't try, the teacher may talk about the importance of grades.

Even if this software isn't able to be avalible in schools, learning about facial actions and cues can benefit everyone. The article give instructions to make a happy face by highlighting points that are present in a naturally happy face. Learning instructions to making the faces of many emotions can be a helpful tool in classrooms and in many other environment when communication is needed. Emotions are a very personal thing and it should be the person's choice whether to show their emotions or not; however, this technology in class rooms may improve the teavhing style so that there aren't as many kids struggling to pass their classes.",0
"Cars are a very big part of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.",0
"One of the most powerful tools for influencing others is providing examples that will help illustrate a point and aid in convincing them of an argument. Examples can demonstrate to people why an idea is important and provide them with a tangible solution to a particular problem. Examples can also serve to show the intended impacts of an action and help to foster an understanding of how a concept can work in the real world.

For example, if we are trying to convince people about the value of investing in renewable energy sources, an example of how other cities have made the switch to renewable sources and seen impressive cost savings can help make the case. Alternatively, if we are trying to make a case for social justice reforms, presenting examples of successful reform initiatives in other countries can make a strong argument for why those reforms should be put in place. In both cases, providing examples can lead to greater understanding of an issue and provide individuals with evidence of how things can be improved.",1
"There are a few people who think that famous people are treated unfairly by the media. They believe that this is the price of their fame.

"There is no right answer to this question as everyone has different opinions on how the government should spend it's money. However, I believe that the government should put money into building theaters and sports stadiums, as this can have a positive impact on the economy.

First of all, building theaters and sports stadiums can create jobs. This is important, as it can help to reduce unemployment rates. In addition, these projects can also help to stimulate the economy, as money is spent on construction and then on tickets to the events.

Furthermore, theaters and sports stadiums can bring in tourists. This can help to boost the economy of the local area, as people will spend money on food, hotels, and other amenities. Additionally, these venues can help to promote the area, which can lead to an increase in tourism in the long run.

Finally, theaters and sports stadiums can be a source of pride for a community. When a community has a new theater or sports stadium, it can help to bring people together and make them feel proud of their area. This can lead to a sense of community spirit and can help to improve the overall quality of life in the area.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should put money into building theaters and sports stadiums. These projects can create jobs, stimulate the economy, and bring in tourists. Additionally, they can help to build community spirit and improve the quality of life in the area.",1
"I do think this could be helpful in many ways, and could help in many ways. It's crazy what some technology can do now days. I think this could be used in a lot of mental and health situations if people are wanting help. This could help the doctor with these problems. But if they start using this in schools and things like that it might not work out as well. Thats just because some kids may not want that or parents.

I don't think this would be very helpful in a classroom. I don't see how it would work and help the school out or anyhing. Unless they are trying to track kids mental and emotional health. And this program is proabably a lot of money to have on computers. Some schools they can spend their money on better things for the kids of the school. Personal I just don't think it could help schools unless they have the program and are using this program for learning perposes.

Yes some schools and collages will use this for learning topics and other things for the kids to learn off of. But other than schools then school the only people I could see having this is like doctors or hospitals. It would be cool in the future if this could turn into a thing for animals and we could see their emotional and mental health. We would be able to see what like dogs or cats are thiking if they are happy or sad.

But this could be bigger in the near future and maybe could help a lot of people. I just don't see how it could help with anything that much. But everything usally has a reason why it's made and it will be used by some people with certain jobs with stuff like this. The big thing on it is it really could help with people that have emotional problems or i guess mental problems too. Or if someone is depressed real bad or something like that.",0
"FREEDOM!

We are all americans here so we should have the freedom we were ment to have. I understand that we do in fact have a lot more freedom than other countries but I am talking more on voting freedom. The electoral college is, in my opinion and many others, a bad way to decide the president of the United States of America. I beleive that for americans we should have a better say in things and agree that we rather have popular voting than what we have now. Others beleive the electoral college helps with Big States issues. But in the end popular vote is a good way to help people who deserver presidency to get it.

The article The Indefensible Electoral College, many have agreed on abolishing the electoral colleg. The article (The Indefensible Electoral College...) states ...according to a Gallup poll in 2000... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to what we are doing now. If we the people do not get final say into things than we are'nt really as free as we are told we are. If the people want a different voting system it should be granted to us. A good example to people who had been effected by this was Al Gore. The articel states. Al Gore who had won by popular vote but still lost the presidency to the electoral college. This goes to show that he was someone that many wanted as a president but where cheated out by the electoral college.

Others may believe that the electoral college helps not let bigger and more populated states get more attention than a smaller state would. But even by popular vote this would be the same. If a populated state votes then they will get basically the same say as they would with the electoral college but it would give them more say. Whilst other low population states get less votes and attention just like with the electoral college. So even though it would make a great change with other things, this matter is no problem.

Few have lost presidency due to the quirks in the electoral college. A good example is Al Gore who I talked about earlier. But still in the future changing to popular vote will help people who earned presidency actually get it. Instead of being scammed out of their votes by the electoral college. If someone has earned the presidencty then they should have the right to it, but with the electoral college in the way some are unable to actually do this. If we the people want someone to be the president than we want them! Al Gore won popular vote but since we do not get the only say he had lost presidency. If popular demand was the only voting system than we would probably be in a better place right now.

In conclusion, we the people of the united states deserve to actually have our own and only say in to who is going to lead us. If we say we want them, we want them... I understand that we our the ones that get the say, but we are being evened out by state percentage, so basically popular voting is ruled out. Popular voting is a better way to vote mainly because it is straight forward and to the point. If someone receives more individual votes than they should be the president... It is a easy straight forward process...",0
"In today's world, competition is often seen as the key to success. However, when it comes to children, I believe that cooperation is a more valuable skill to teach. While competition can be motivating, it can also be damaging to a child's self-esteem and can lead to a lack of empathy for others. In contrast, cooperation teaches children to work together, to value the contributions of others, and to develop important social skills.

One of the main reasons why I believe that children should be taught to cooperate is that it helps them to develop important social skills. When children learn to work together, they learn how to communicate effectively, how to listen to others, and how to compromise. These skills are essential for success in any area of life, whether it be in school, in the workplace, or in personal relationships. By learning to cooperate, children also learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others, which can help them to develop empathy and compassion.

Another reason why I believe that cooperation is more valuable than competition is that it teaches children to value the contributions of others. In a competitive environment, the focus is often on individual achievement, and children may be encouraged to disregard the contributions of others in order to succeed. In contrast, when children learn to cooperate, they learn to value the contributions of others and to work together to achieve a common goal. This can lead to a greater sense of community and can help children to develop a sense of responsibility towards others.

Finally, I believe that cooperation is more beneficial for children's self-esteem than competition. In a competitive environment, children who do not succeed may feel like failures, which can damage their self-esteem and lead to feelings of inadequacy. In contrast, when children learn to cooperate, they learn that success is not just about individual achievement, but about working together to achieve a common goal. This can help to build children's self-esteem and can lead to a greater sense of confidence and self-worth.

In conclusion, while competition can be motivating, I believe that cooperation is a more valuable skill to teach children. By learning to work together, children develop important social skills, learn to value the contributions of others, and develop a greater sense of self-esteem. These skills are essential for success in any area of life, and I believe that they are best developed through cooperation rather than competition.",1
"In general, I believe that life was better when technology was simpler. With modern technology, there are so many distractions and temptations that it is often difficult to focus on what is important. For example, with technology, it is easy to become addicted to social media and to lose track of time. Additionally, modern technology can be overwhelming and stressful, especially for people who are not used to it.

On the other hand, some people might argue that modern technology makes life more convenient. For example, with technology, it is easy to stay connected with friends and family, even if they are far away. Additionally, modern technology can be helpful for tasks such as grocery shopping and banking.

Ultimately, I believe that modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages. I think that it is important to be aware of the risks and to use technology in a responsible way.",1

"Success in life comes not from idling, but from actively pursuing one’s goals. In Thomas Jefferson’s famous quote, “Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing,” the Founding Father demonstrated a great deal of insight into human potential. Being active and productive can open doors to a world of achievements, as long as we utilize our time strategically. 

Productivity is a major part of success, and it is important to remember that idle people have lower chances for success. Those who prioritize action-taking are much more likely to create tangible accomplishments in their life, career, and relationships. Imagine the rewards of setting longer-term goals and pushing yourself to completion. Instead of avoiding challenges, active people can bravely battle difficult tasks and come out more successful than before. 

When we take action, something powerful begins to take our life in an intentional direction. Everything is in our control, from forming relationships to controlling finances. The possibilities are endless when we make a conscious effort to develop our life and work. When embarking on a significant project, big or small, one should take a break in between milestones. Without making breaks for your own well-being, excess work can easily cause burnout.

It’s true that much can be accomplished when we are constantly active. Taking action is the key to succeeding and reaching goals. So, heed Thomas Jefferson’s words: “Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.”",1
"MY SCHOOL SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THIS MODEL BY EXTENDING THE SCHOOL DAY BY TWO- HOURS

The addition of two hours to the school day will benefit the school poorly but,

will cause a huge disadvantage to students and the school as a whole. The four - day work week will not be beneficial to my school because,

it would reduce the amount of time students have for other activities,

and also this will result in the inability of students to learn more, and as a result students are affected mentally and psychologically.

To begin with, the school day has been designed in a special way which gives students, a reasonable amount of time to involve themselves in after school activities. These activities help the students acquire other skills different from what we acquire in school. For example, students who also take part in sports do not have enough time to practice or train after school if these 2 hours are added. Other students who work after school will begin to work fewer hours because they also need time to study and revise. As a student, time is needed to attain your goals and time also determines your future.

In addition to, the student brain can't function as well as an adult brain after some hours of serious work .The brain becomes tired and needs rest after some time, but the adult brain can do more because it is well developed than the student brain. After lunch, the students can study to a maximum of 3 hours only before feeling sleepy or tired and if these hours are extended, students will feel reluctant to study, which makes these extended hours a waste of time. Due to this, students won't take these hours seriously but will only disturb or disrupt the class which produces no positive result at the end of the class. The school makes sure that wastage of time is extremely prevented to produce positive outcomes and results.

Furthermore, to become a successful student, individuals must be mentally upright and psychologically sound to allow learning to be much easier and convenient. If these 2 hours are added to the school day, the students won't be mentally stable because, they would be stressed from pushing themselves to learn more even tho they are tired. Psychologically, this will reduce a student's ability to understand new things being thought and also prevents them from revising past information or work given. If this is happens, students will begin to forget past information and how to apply them which will become a problem in the near future.

Conclusively,this four - day work week would benefit other other institutions but won't benefit an institution like my school because my school works and remains successful mainly by the use of precious time and effort.

"Cell phones. Almost everyone has them but over the past couple of years have they became a issue where they have caused peoples life's. Many people find the time to be on there phones anywhere at anytime they want including while driving. People have been putting each other in danger just to see a text or a notification while not paying attention to the road this simple action can cause a person to lose there life.

Image a teenage girl first time on the road and is finally able to have her freedom and rights of driving. The girl is driving carefully and responsibly until she gets a notification from her boyfriend saying we need to talk. The girl hesitates to answer the text message while she is looking back and forth from the road to her phone until she finally grabs the phone from the cup holder. She started to text back her boyfriend while running a red light and getting T-boned on her side of the car causing a crash. This is just one of the million possibility's that could happen while texting and driving. This is also a reason as to why under no conditions should a person text while drive. What if the girl didn't pick up the phone? What if instead she turned it off or pulled over onto the side of the road. A text message will be there forever but your life dose not.

Not only are you putting your life at risk but you are also putting other peoples life at risk. For example there's a man driving a truck and just got a text message from his wife he figures that since there is no one on the road nothing bad would happen so while he is texting while driving he dose not notices a boy riding a bike crossing the street he looks up from his phone and realizes whats about to happen and steps on the breaks on time. What if he didn't stop on time what if he kept texting. his actions did not effect him but it effected others such as that little boy. This is why for no reason should you text call or face time while drive it dose not matter how you do it you are still putting other peoples life at stake including your own.

In conclusion drivers should never text while drive because you are then putting your life and others at risk. If only drivers would think before they do something then maybe more people would be alive today. Maybe the girl in the car crash would be alive today maybe the boy riding his bike would be alive today. Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. You are not only driving for yourself but for everybody. A text message can last forever but your life will not.",0

"When it comes to the topic of home security, many people feel a sense of reassurance knowing that their property is well protected. With advancements in technology and increased access to higher quality home security options, more homeowners now have the peace of mind they need to sleep soundly at night and enjoy their property without worry. Home security systems come in all shapes and sizes, from basic door locks with combination codes to high tech surveillance cameras with motion detectors. No two properties are the same when it comes down to choosing what type of system works best for them; each person needs something different based on their specific residential needs. However, there are some universal steps one should take when looking into purchasing a home security system: researching available products from reputable companies; assessing your space; budgeting for installation costs—including both initial fees along with ongoing subscription fees; understanding warranties or guarantees offered by manufacturers; making sure you're familiar with local laws regarding any additional regulations surrounding footage collected by cameras or other types of recording devices within your residence's boundaries. Beyond just traditional alarm systems, many homes might also benefit from smart home automation systems that allow users not only control over who enters and exits their property (via connected door locks) but energy efficiency as well (through automated lighting control). This option can be especially helpful if someone isn't always around—such as during long trips out-of-town or extended vacations—as features like geofencing make it possible for individuals remotely activate predetermined settings while away from their house that simulate occupancy within its walls (by controlling lights/blinds/thermostat etc.). Whether you choose an advanced CCTV setup complete with digital video recorders and intelligent facial recognition software or simply opt for a simpler solution consisting solely of deadbolts combined with window locks, having at least some form of added protection beyond regular maintenance can provide much needed peace of mind when it comes time to leave your house empty again after enjoying another great day spent inside its walls",1
"The advent of online school has ushered in a new era for young scholars. The potential benefits of online school are manifold—it can make higher education more accessible to students with disabilities or illnesses, provide a more flexible learning environment for students, and open up opportunities for them to gain employment. On the other hand, some drawbacks of online school should not be overlooked. The prevalence of technology in every home is not a given, thus access to computers and the internet can be quite a challenge for many students, particularly in some socio-economic communities. Nevertheless, the potential for online school to help both those with disabilities or illness and the economy, should not be discounted. With the right technological infrastructure and support, online school could become an option for all school districts, allowing students to access educational opportunities that would otherwise be unavailable.",1
"No matter how hard we try, it is impossible for us to have the exact same life experiences that someone else has had. Every single one of us has our own individual path through life that gives us a unique perspective of the world around us. While the circumstances that brought us to this moment are different, they have shaped us and created the people we are today. 

When it comes to living other people's experiences, the answer isn't a simple yes or no. We can empathize with someone else's story, and feel similar emotions as them. We might have the same emotion from a similar situation, even if it didn't happen to us, but it's never going to be the exact same. We may also observe and learn from the experiences of other people, and take what we learn and apply it in our own life. However, the experience won't be the exact same, since we haven't actually lived it first-hand. 

Ultimately, we have to create our own life experiences and explore what this world has to offer. While we can observe and learn from the experiences of others, we must also embrace our own journey through life and make the most of it. As the saying goes, “you’ll never know till you try”. While we can understand other people's life stories, we will never experience them in the same way. It's ok to take ideas or lessons from their experiences, but in the end, we all have to create our own unique path.",1
"Today's society is not worried about who has the nicest or fastest car, they just want to be able to get from point A to point B. That's why the amount of driving has decreased by 9 percent since 2005. This has helped the environment by reducing the amount of pollution and has made people happier and not as stressed.

As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughout the years, different countries have encouraged less driving for less pollution. For example, In Bogota, Columbia, their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Other places, like Paris, banned driving to clear the air of the global city. This is due to days of nearrecord pollution. The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution.

Another advantage less driving is it makes people happier. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, says, When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way. Also, businessman, Carlos A. Plaza, said, It's a good opportunity to take away stress. as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife. When you don't drive, you don't have to worry about being late for work because of traffic jams, you won't be mad because someone just cut you off, or that the teenage girl in front of you isn't paying attention because she is talking on the phone and doing her mascara. Once you get out and ride a bike or walk down the street, you will realize how stressful driving can be.

In conclusion, driving only causes air pollution and more stressful days. Walking, riding a bike, or riding the bus not only saves money, but it also helps the environment and makes you a happy person.",0
"Technology

I think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people' live. Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

If today we do not have technology, maybe we need many people to do for one work. We need cost more time. It is not a good things for us. Time is important, in fact, we do not have too much time in our life, we need to ues the less time to finish one thing. So how can we find a way to use less time to do the work? Technology will help us.

People do not need contact work together. It save many time and improve the work. We can use the less time to do more work.

So that is why I think has the limtation of human contact due to the use of technongy had positive on people's live.",0
"There is a limit to car usage. A car can really come in handy but its not nessary. Gas is not all that cheap for evryone either. Cars don't need to be used for everyhting but since thats an easy way to get around people just take advantage of that and use it. People can cause lots of damage with the way they use there car. Weather people of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice ans schoolplaus remains an open question.

A car can really help you out in some cases. But it not nessary at all. There are lots of other things you can do to help help out. Their are things you can do to get you places and also helping you out. Example riding a bike, gets you to exercise and also take you places. Needing of a car isn't so needy anymore.But america's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling.

people do can cause lots of damage with there vehicles. The amount of care people have with driving is rediculous. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city. Their are sidewalks that have to be replaced,rush-hour restrictions that have dramatically cut traffic. All these can happen for careless people instead of following such simple things.

Not only do people use up gas in there car but also miles. The number of miles used in your vehicle does matter. The number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis. Means car usage is very high in the united states. My opinion cars are no nessasary for everything. There are more to use or do to get to places which may take longer or faster but still getting there.

Some advantages of limiting your car usage. Yes there are much limits to it which are important. People should really start using or finding other way to go.Its's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.",0
"Have you ever been in a problem and you're not exactly sure what to do? Well a lot of people have. Lets say you're confused on what to do when doing something, some people may try to figure out what to do by their self, some may also seek advice from others. When asking for an opinion, you're asking other people what they think. After you have gotten your advice, your set! You got an opinion that could possibly help you out. But one isn't always enough, there are loads of people that have different opinions too, one is good, but more is better.

One opinion is a door that has opportunity, but when you ask more people for opinions, it opens more doors with more opportunity. Asking for more than one opinion can be good becuase it can help you with the task at hands. With more than one opinion you can think about how they are helpful and if they are worth paying attention to. Now that you have multiple opinions, you think of which one will help you the most, you will have a bigger idea on things involving the situation. When listening to an opinion, there are details that help support their idea, and sometimes these details are worth paying attention to. What people add along with their opinion can make the room expand giving you more things to explore.

In conclusion, when having trouble with something, asking for someones advice can open up an opportunity. But when you ask for more advice from more people, there are more opportunities to explore and think about. Asking for more opinions will give you a bigger understanding on how or what to do. Opinions are helpful in about every way possible, because they add details that help you with the task at hand. The details of one can lead to the details of many, more the people, more the understanding, but hey what do i know, thats just my opinion.",0
"Successful people are often known for their ability to take risks and try new things. They are always looking for ways to improve themselves and their work, rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well. In my opinion, I completely agree with this statement as trying new things and taking risks is the only way to grow and succeed in life.

To begin with, trying new things and taking risks can help individuals discover their true potential. When we step out of our comfort zone and try something new, we often surprise ourselves with what we are capable of. For example, a person who has always been afraid of public speaking may take a risk and enroll in a speaking course. By doing this, they may discover that they have a natural talent for speaking and could potentially become a great public speaker. Taking risks allows us to discover new talents and interests that we may have never known existed.

Furthermore, taking risks and trying new things can help us overcome our fears and build confidence. When we take on new challenges, we are forced to confront our fears and push past them. As we accomplish these challenges, we build our confidence and self-esteem, which in turn makes us more successful in all areas of our life. For example, a student who is afraid of public speaking may take a risk and give a presentation in class. As they successfully complete the presentation, they may feel more confident and ready to take on new challenges in the future, such as leading a group project or applying for a leadership position.

In addition, trying new things and taking risks can help us become more adaptable and flexible. The world is constantly changing, and those who are able to adapt to these changes are the ones who thrive. By taking risks and trying new things, we become more comfortable with change, and we learn how to adapt quickly to new situations. This adaptability is a key skill needed for success in today’s fast-paced and ever-changing world.

Finally, trying new things and taking risks can help us achieve our goals and dreams. Success is not just about luck or talent; it is about hard work and perseverance. By taking risks and trying new things, we are giving ourselves the opportunity to achieve our goals and dreams. For example, an entrepreneur who takes a risk and starts a new business may face many challenges and setbacks along the way, but by persevering and continuing to take risks, they may eventually achieve great success.

In conclusion, successful people are those who are willing to take risks and try new things. They are not afraid to step out of their comfort zone, confront their fears, and push themselves to new heights. By doing this, they are able to discover their true potential, build confidence, become more adaptable, and achieve their goals and dreams. Therefore, I believe that trying new things and taking risks are crucial for success in all areas of life.",1
"I agree that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. The main reasons for this are the increasing popularity of alternative transportation methods such as bicycles, public transportation, and walking, as well as the increasing cost of car ownership.

One example of an alternative transportation method that is gaining in popularity is cycling. According to the League of American Bicyclists, cycling is now the most popular form of transportation in many U. S. Cities, and it is also growing in popularity around the world. In fact, the number of cyclists on the road has increased by 50% in the past decade. This is likely due to the increasing popularity of cycling as a way to improve health, reduce pollution, and save money.

Another reason why the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years is because of the increasing cost of car ownership. The cost of car ownership has been on the rise for a number of reasons, including the increased cost of fuel, the increased cost of repairs, and the increased cost of parking. In addition, the cost of car ownership has been increasing faster than the rate of inflation, which has made it more difficult for people to afford cars.

Overall, I believe that the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years, due to the increasing popularity of alternative transportation methods, the increasing cost of car ownership, and the increasing cost of fuel.",1
"When it comes to the topic of fast fashion, there is no question that this has become a major issue for modern society. Fast fashion is defined as cheaply produced clothing that copies catwalk designs and trends from celebrities and influencers, with an average lifespan of just five weeks before being replaced by new styles. This process not only creates immense amounts of textile waste but also results in low-cost workers' exploitation and environmental damage. The growing demand for ever more fashionable clothes at affordable prices has caused companies to increase their production rates exponentially over the past few decades. Mass production allows companies to reduce costs significantly while still providing customers with the latest styles on offer. However, this approach can have dire consequences on both people's health and our environment due to its unsustainable nature. Firstly, cheap labour practices are often employed within fast fashion supply chains which means workers bear the brunt of these cost reductions through exploitative working conditions such as long hours, poor wages and hazardous materials handling practices without any form of legal protection or insurance benefits; not to mention lack of job security or proper safety standards in many cases. Furthermore, much needed resources such as water consumption and energy use often increases tremendously when mass producing clothes compared with traditional methods resulting significant environmental impacts ranging from air pollution resulting from chemical bleaching processes used during dying fabrics all the way up to microfibre pollution leaking into our oceans from synthetic textiles washing machines cycles - threatening marine life species health globally . . . 			. Therefore it is clear that we need urgent action if we want to avoid further contributing towards climate change: consumers must start pushing back against companies offering products made via unethical practices by taking their business elsewhere; governments should secure better regulatory frameworks protecting vulnerable workers in developing countries where most apparel production takes place; finally big brands should take responsibility for their actions by incorporating more sustainable approaches within their operations such us investing heavily into ethical manufacturing policies ,switching towards recycled material sources insteads relying exclusively upon virgin raw",1
"In the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author explains that researching and exploring Venus is a risky challenge to do due to the dangers of it, but he says that it would be worthy to do it.

So the dangers of Venus is that each previous mission was umanned and that was for a good reason. since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades (Paragraph 2). The atmosphere of it is almost 97% of carbon dioxide. The clouds are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

But even though that there are these dangers on Venus Astronomers are not going to stop with this. Venus must of had been like Earth once before in the solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth (Paragraph 4). The planet has a rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters that are on Earth today.

So the question is what are the choices that is going to both keep the mission safe and scientific productive? Well The National Aeronautics and Space Administration known as NASA has an idea to this solution. Since there is terrible conditions on the surface of Venus. The only was to survive is to be above the ground. So the idea is that having a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the landscape. Thus, even being above it would still be hot around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be kind of like Earth's sea level. And there would be plentiful solar power. And since sending elctronics there would melt it mechanical machines would withstand the dangers of Venus.

Overall, Venus is a dangerous planet and dangerous conditions. Thats not going to stop us to explore Venus. Our curosity drives us to do it.",0
"Students failure the game every time when we have a game with another team, because for some reasons they do not beat the game. Sometimes student do not sleep as well, or they do not have much energy to play, because they do not eat before start the game. Everybody needs to know before they have a game we need to eat healthy, and drink enough water. Sometimes famous death for that kind of reason, so we need to learn about the experience. Life is very important for everybody, so we need to look what's the first thing we can do before they think and act too.

Family is more important than the game, so they do not have time to practice. Sometimes family want to explore places for example; New York, Florida, and Boston that state has beautiful place to swim play, and we can do everything. That's why student do not have time to practice the game. Game is an important thing they can learn too much, and maybe in the future they can get a award like a professional or famous on games.

Some students do not have time to practice, because they need to work to pay the bills for example; pay the insurance for the car, pay the rent where they live, and also pay the bill for the cellphone. That's is the reason we do not have time to practice. That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day. When it is time to practice the game we do not have energy to play, so that is the cause we lost the game every time. We needed to work a part-time on that way we got more time to practice the game, so the next time we can win the game. Sometimes the family do not help them, because they said we need to learn how they make a money to obtain the food for each person.

Eating healthy is good for everyone, so we need to eat every day. Also we can eat fruit every time, because that has to much protein. That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. they need to go the gym too, because that help you to get a healthy body. Sometimes the first thing we can do is eating, and then go to sleep this is not a good choice for them.

We need to help them because sometimes we have a dream, but no body try to help that's why students can't realized they dreams. If they can continuing to study in the future they can earn to much money, because in the past it was hard for them, but now is more easily then the first time when they start",0
"Most people disagreee on the idea of taking away cars or creating fuel effeicent cars. One idea that can possibly top all those is a limited car usage society. Natiosn worldwide have vbegun starting a new trend/ orsmartplanning which limits cars usage due to the ecomony ,pollution it creates.

To begin with, limiting cars is becoming a new fad, people in  VAUBAN,Germany(Dorchland) say  it saves alot of time and money. Now you can just have your house in the suburbs and just stick to foot traffic youdont have to worry about car insurance or garages or keeping drive ways clean. No more dirty streets clean and motor sound free walking. With this new smart planning going on its harder for people to take there kids around and get to work. What goes along with this effect it saves people more money.

Lastly, Limiting usage of cars is going to help better the enviorment. Recently paris was under an enforced ban due to to a cloud of smog pollution. The use of cars releases toxi and bad gases into the atomosphere destroying are enviorment and causing effects on the polar ice caps. The limit use of cars cuts traffic down and time. another effect use we could use is a car free day were we could take buses , bicycles , and even skateboards. one major thing we should replace with our cars is public transports.

Inconclusion

Limiting cars usage is helpful and becoming more popular globally it can help the economy and also help slow down pollution.",0
"With the rapid development of technology, it is becoming increasingly easy to engage in online shopping. Online shopping has become a popular and convenient way for people to purchase goods from all over the world. While most people associate online shopping with convenience, ease of access, and variety of product options there are several potential risks that consumers should be aware of before making an online purchase. One risk associated with purchasing items over the internet is data security. Online retailers often collect personal information such as name, address, email address and credit card details when transactions occur which makes customers vulnerable to identity theft or fraudulent activity on their accounts. As a result, shoppers must practice safe internet browsing habits while searching for items they wish to buy whether it’s through researching the company’s privacy policy or taking steps such as using secure payment methods like PayPal or Apple Pay rather than entering your credit card information directly into an unfamiliar website's checkout page. Furthermore, shoppers should always check a site's trustworthiness by looking for customer reviews prior to making any purchases on new sites that they don't recognize so as not give away sensitive financial information without knowing if you can really trust them first. Another risk facing consumer who shop online pertains to delivery reliability; when buying something off the internet customers are essentially trusting third party companies like FedEx or UPS with delivering their item correctly and safely on-time even though in some cases products will take weeks (or months) longer than expected due to various reasons like extreme weather conditions or customs regulations etc… To help mitigate these risks buyers should always read up about different shipping policies offered by each store/website before committing  to make sure that their order will arrive promptly since many stores offer refund policies if packages do not reach within a certain time frame which may also vary depending on where you live geographically too! Additionally it may be beneficial for buyers who value speediness look into express courier services such as DHL Express instead since typically these types of service providers have",1
"By limiting car usage, research has shown there is less greenhouse gas emissions, a promotion in alternative transportation, and can result in a new and improved safe society.

To begin, the advantages of limiting car usage reduces the amount of pollution that is emitted into the air, resulting in a more environmental friendly neighborhood. According to research in Vauban, Germany, ...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Source 1 Many locations around the world are taking this act into perspectiveincluding not only Vauban,Germanybut also Paris,France, Bogota,Colombia, and even cities in the United States that are reducing these numbers drastically and making a beneficial change in the environment. If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions. Next, with the declining usage of cars, citizens are left with alternative transportation that are beneficial. Many people have gone from driving carsgetting from point A to point Bto visiting parks and sports centers, which can lead to an increase in physical activity. Another advantage to giving up your car can also lead to less traffic. According to the new routine in Colombia, Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.Source 3 In Paris, officials are enforcing drivers to clear the air of the global city with a partial driving ban. With this new ban in play, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. Source 2 Since the change, public transit from Friday to Monday was free of charge. As you can see, these changes are coming into effect and are changing the world in various positive ways.

Heidrun Walter said, When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this wayreferring to giving her car up. Source 3 Businessman Carls arturo Plaza also says, This is a good opportunity to reduce stress and lower air pollution. Source 3 In addition, the reduction of car usage leads to a safer environment. According to my. Sivak's research, There has been a large drop in the pecentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age.Source 4 A study found that driving by young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. With this evolutionary change in peoples everyday lives, many large numbers are drastically going down, revealing numerous advantages. The number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak, the rates of car ownership per household and per person has started to come down two to three years before the downturn, and demographic shifts in the driving population all reveal that people may find less reason to resume to their cardriven habits.

To conclude, the limiting of car usage can improve the environent, can result in numerous transportation opportunities, and can lead to a safer society.",0
"The   seems to be a very aggravating phrase for an entire population of people who have become so dependent on it. It's a concept that we can't take in. We Americans use our cars for a personal use daily. We are so accustomed to our cars that we just use it to perform simple tasks that we could use our legs that were given to us, for free, to cross the street. When the average person says that they would like to go to the market across the street, probably about 70%, don't even think about the fact that we could just simply walk there. Cars are enlarging our environment and our health. Cars create so much pollution and is a healthrisk. Our cars seem to be as important as one of our limbs. Something you could not bare to live without. Now here are some of the reasons why.

To begin with, cars are polluting our atmosphere. Have you ever heard of the green house effect? It's endangering our Earth, by polluting it, which is contributing to Global Warming. Cars are something we shouldn't always rely on. We have to get accustomed to the way of the pioneers. We all just need to limit the amount of times we use our cars and think, hmm.. do i really need to use my car right now? Can't i just use my two working legs to get to where i want to go, which is right down the block. In the article, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, paragraph 5 lines 69, the article states that, and i quote, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some carintensive areas of the United States. Which is a whole lot of damage we are inflicting our own environment that we need to thrive on and live off. In reality, cars are overrated. We don't always need it, so we shouldn't always use it.

In the article, Paris bans driving due to smog, paragraph 12 lines 13, it states, congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after 5days of intensifying smog. Imagine all of that pollution on this earth if we kept using our cars, which are slowly killing us.

Not only do cars endanger our environment, but it also creates a huge healthrisk factor.

Cars can make us become lazy. We can use our cars so much to the point where we could get accustomed to cars and grow tired and weary of using our legs. We may as well just live in a car. Cars could also create lots of stress. In artcile Carfree day is spinning a big hit in Bogota., paragraph 5 lines 12, the author interviews someone and that person claims that,  It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower airpollution. In Conclusion, we together as a whole should limit our car usage to cut back on pollution. We should all learn to be in touch with our environment and to just walk around in our clean, ecofriendly air. If we cut back, we wouldn't have to be worried about Global Warming anymore. We would all be closer, one step at a time.",0

"The Electoral College is not fair and should be abolished. Did you know that 60 percent of voters would prefer a more direct way to vote then what we have now. That is a lot of people who just want a more trustworthy and direct voting process. The Electoral College should be abolished because you can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all.

Having your trust in people who you only see campaigns for on television is pretty hard to do. Honestly that is quite ridiculous for them to ask of us. In source 2, paragraph 11, Plumer tells us about how sometimes faithless electors disregard their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please. So is it really worth going through the trouble of electing poeple who might not even do as they said they would. Posner on the other hand explains that the trust in the elector is rarely betrayed source 3, paragraph 16. But is it really worth risking four, maybe eight years of our lives to trust poeple we really do not know. Not to mention how it could affect our jobs and lives at home if this does happen.

Did you know seventeen states didn't see any candidates at all in the 2000 campaign. In source 2, paragraph 13, Plumer talks about how candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win. This leaves many states who do not get to see any candidates at all. This makes those states feel like their votes do not count and worry if they their new president willl have any regards for their interest. In source 3, paragraph 19, Posner says that this is a good thing that candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win because then that candidate can focus on the states that may be undecided or swing states. He believes this is a good thing because a candidate with appeal in only a few states is unlikely to be a good president. But you are leaving out a big proportion of the United States population who would love the expiernce of hearing a cadidate give a passionate speech about why heshe should be elected.

We can come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be abolished because you really can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all, which then makes them feel worthless. Furthermore, we can say that the new way to elect the president should be more direct and fair.",0
"Venus is an extremely inhabitable environment for people. Although Venus is alike Earth in many ways, it has plenty of risk factors as well. In this text, the author makes it clear that there are bountiful amounts of information on Venus that humans could collect, but it is far too dangerous. He shows that we could find so much worthy evidence and history on this planet but it is simply too extreme. He makes note that even though it can reach 800 degrees, astronauts should still pursue the idea.

In the text the author states Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This shows that getting into Venus could potentially help NASA dig deeper into other planets. A whole world of information is neighboring our planet every day.

The author also states imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This shows we could still escape the harsh climate to get needed information.

Venus is an incredible planet, and with time humans will be able to explore it. This text shows strong proof that traveling there is worthy. With the technology we have today, the day NASA decides to go to Venus is just around the corner.",0
"Cell phones. Love 'em or hate 'em, they're here to stay. But should we be using 'em while driving? I'm gonna say... no way!

First off, let me just say that driving is already hard enough. Like, have you seen all the things you gotta keep track of?! There's pedestrians, other cars, traffic lights, road signs... it's a lot to handle! And now you wanna add texting or talking on the phone to that list? No thanks!

I mean, think about it. When you're texting, you gotta look at your phone, right? But that means you're not looking at the road. And if you're not looking at the road, you're gonna crash! It's just common sense.

And don't even get me started on talking on the phone. I mean, sure, it's hands-free and all that, but you're still not paying attention to the road. You're focused on the conversation, not the cars around you. It's like, hello! You're driving a 2-ton vehicle, you can't afford to be distracted!

Now, I know some people are gonna say, But what about emergencies? What if someone needs to call 911? And I get that. But here's the thing: if it's a real emergency, you should be pulling over to the side of the road, not trying to drive and talk at the same time. It's just not safe.

And let's not forget about all the accidents that happen because of cell phone use while driving. Like, have you heard about that one kid who crashed his car because he was snapchatting? Yeah, that's not cool.

So, in conclusion (that's a fancy word for summary), drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any way while operating a vehicle. It's just too dangerous. We gotta keep our eyes on the road and our hands on the wheel. That's how we can avoid accidents and keep ourselves and others safe.

And if you don't like it, well, you can just walk! 😜",1
"Phones & driving

Many people have different opinions about cellphone use while driving. In my opinion I don't think that is should be allowed to do.

There are many accidents caused by people texting and driving according to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging, so in that being said it is really dangerous for people to be using their cellphone while driving because you cant see where you are going and you are being entertained on your phone than looking for what is actually happening in the road. For example if you are driving while texting and the light turns red and you don't see that because you are texting then there is a high chance that you are going to be involved in an accident. It is extremely dangerous to text while driving because it could mean jail time or you could possibly hurt someone. In georgia there is this new law that if the police see you using your cellphone you could get pulled over for it. Everyone just don't use your cellphone while on the road and if it's an emergency pull over to a side or go stop at a nearby place but not while driving.",0
"Some countryes do not have the right for vote for who they whant to be president, and the candidate who gets to be the president takes the freedom and security of any person who oppose to him.

It is not fair that something like that could star to thake place in the United States. This country is for the ones that are looking for freedom to have the right to argue their way of thinkind and express, in a good way.

We have the right to know the candidate's potential, knowledge, way of thinking, how he will governate the United States, hir goal for this country, his expectatives, and if he is able to be a leader. Because if we do not have the right to vote, our way of thinking and our rights is not important. The country depends on the persons who live in there, too. There has to be an agreeement  between the citizens, because there has to be a leader who can be able to defend the country and citizens.

The Electoral Collage does not has a democratic method of selectiong a president, and if there is a tie in electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives , where state delegations vote on the president and the Senate would choose the vide-president.

The Electoral Collage is unfair to voters, outdated, and irrational. The disaster factor was the biggest election crisis, and considerinf that the state legislatures are are responsable for picking the electors.

"Self-esteem can be achieved through a variety of activities that focus on different aspects of one's life. Respect, effort, and behavior all have an impact on self-esteem. By building strong relationships with friends and family, forming healthy habits, and taking pride in the work that one is capable of, it is possible to feel better about oneself. 

Respect for oneself is an important factor in maintaining self-esteem. Considering one's actions and what kind of impact they have on others will help form a sense of self-worth. Being mindful of how one is treated and how one treats others helps create a sense of security.

Making a conscious effort to build better habits and take ownership of one's behavior is also necessary for self-esteem. Instead of taking the easy way out, putting in the time and energy to get the job done is an effective way to build self-confidence. Along with this comes the idea that even if mistakes are made, a person can learn from them and be open to the idea of growth and improvement.

Education can help build self-esteem, too. Learning new skills, tactics, and knowledge can lead to new opportunities and experiences. Learning how to prioritize tasks and develop organizational skills will lead to better functioning in everyday life.

Ultimately, having a sense of self-esteem comes from within, and the only person who can make it happen is the one taking the steps necessary to make it happen. When respect for oneself and others, effort, and behavior are all considered, it is possible to attain a healthy sense of self-esteem.",1
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus

In the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author explains the dangers of exploring our sister planet, but he also explains why we should. The article gives that Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky but also unable to land on being that it is covered in a thick atomsphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide and covered in sulfuric acid clouds. He explains how striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because human curisoity will likely lead us to into many equally intimidating endeavors. The pursuit of traveling to Venus is worth it since the knowledge that we'd gain and could possiably lead to other greater discoveries is to great to pass up.

The author explains the risk that apporach in traveling to Venus such as the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomshpere... If we were to take the challenge to travel,we have a possiablily of getting samples such as rocks and dirt and even the smallest bit will help our knowledge of our sister planet. The author also states ... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. But the author provides us with ways to aviod this problem by creating a blimp-like vechicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Proving that those who we'd send would be able to study but also protected from the planets sulferic acid clouds.

The pursuit of traveling to Venus is worth it since the knowledge that we'd gain and could possiably lead to other greater discoveries is to great to pass up.

"My fellow citizens of America, we are in a crisis where pollution is at an all time high. We need to find a way to limit the amount of pollution given into our atmosphere. And I have found that solution. If we can reduce the usage of automobiles and form car-free communities pollution rates will drop to rock bottom in a matter of time. Germany and France are leading the way to limiting the usage of cars.

In Germany the town of Vauban street parking, driveways, and garages are strictly forbidden in the experimental district. You may own a car but you have to park it in a large parking garages and pay 40,000 for a space. In result to this change 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move there. Due to these actions the United States Enviormental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communities. These are facts that we are taking a step forward in reducing the usage cars in everday life

Paris is very well known for the smog because of its consistant use of automobiles,therefore they have banned the usage of auto mobiles to clear the air of the smog",0
"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Scientific Pursuit

The author makes a compelling case that exploring Venus remains a worthy scientific endeavor, in spite of the planet's extremely harsh environment. Several key pieces of evidence from the article support this claim. 

To begin, the article outlines the many mysteries that still surround Venus, such as the details of its atmospheric composition and geological history. Resolving these unknowns could offer insights into atmospheric evolution and the nature of terrestrial planet formation. Advancing scientific understanding of planetary processes in this way is an intellectually rewarding goal. The article also notes that Venus may preserve evidence relevant to understanding Earth's early history, prior to our atmosphere becoming more hospitable. Gaining new perspectives on our own planet's past is certainly a pursuit worth undertaking.

In addition, the author explains that technological advances have helped enable new types of missions that can investigate Venus safely. For example, aircraft designed to withstand high temperatures and pressure could study the Venusian atmosphere without landing on its scorching surface. The article provides examples of proposed craft like balloons and airplanes tailored for Venus' extreme climate. With innovative engineering and materials science, the dangers Venus poses can now be partially overcome. This opens the door for valuable discoveries about a planet long assumed unexplorable. 

While Venus presents formidable obstacles, the author makes a reasoned case that our capacity to study it has grown greatly in recent years. Resolving open questions about Venus could enhance scientific knowledge in several key areas. With continued progress in adapting technologies for its conditions, perhaps one day humans can directly explore our sister planet in new ways. Overall, the article provides strong support for its claim that investigating Venus remains scientifically worthwhile despite the risks, through clear evidence of ongoing mysteries, potential insights, and advancement of exploration methods. Venus still holds promise to reveal surprises about the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets like Earth.",1
"Exploring a new planet could be as hard as exploring any planets. Planets have many differences from things we're used to on earth.

In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author suggest studying venus is a worthy pursuit. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is a very close planet to us and is known as the sister planet which, means it is close and could be an alternative if something happens to earth. In the passage the author explains how we could adapt if people were to go there systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. The author also states Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Not only mechanical parts and machines, alot of things could be made for people to be able to adapt to Venus.

In conclusion exploring Venus would not be a bad move for NASA because of the possibilities of what could be there and what we could do to adapt there if we had to. Theres alot of things we could do for it to be ok for people to be there and could be an alternative planet.",0

[State Senator's Address]
[City, State, ZIP]

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my position on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election process for the President of the United States. After careful consideration and examination of multiple viewpoints, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College system rather than changing to a popular vote system. The Electoral College serves several important purposes, including providing a certainty of outcome, promoting regional inclusivity, focusing campaign efforts, balancing power between large and small states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome is significantly reduced, offering stability and avoiding prolonged disputes over the popular vote. In an already complex electoral process, a clear outcome is essential for maintaining public trust and confidence in our democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. As Judge Posner points out, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on highly populated urban centers or densely populated regions, but instead take into account the concerns and interests of diverse populations across the nation. This inclusivity fosters a sense of unity among different regions and prevents the presidency from becoming dominated by a few states or regions.

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states or toss-up states where the outcome is less certain. This prompts candidates to not only pay attention to the concerns of these states but also actively engage with voters and address their specific needs. This focus on swing states leads to a more informed and engaged electorate as voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. The Electoral College system, therefore, promotes a greater degree of voter participation and thoughtful decision-making.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to balance the power between large and small states. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to Senate mal-apportionment. By giving each state a number of electoral votes based on its population, the system ensures that presidential candidates cannot solely rely on the support of heavily populated states. This recognition of smaller states' interests prevents elections from being dominated by highly populous regions or urban centers, ensuring that the voices of rural and less-populated areas are also heard and their concerns addressed.

Lastly, the Electoral College system avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This not only simplifies the electoral process but also saves time and resources. Without the Electoral College, our election process could become more complex and prone to prolonged campaigns, which can be costly and may hinder the smooth functioning of our democratic system. The current system, by consistently producing a clear winner, ensures a smooth transition and allows the President to govern with a mandate from the electoral majority.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system serves important purposes in our democracy. It provides a certainty of outcome, promotes regional inclusivity, focuses campaign efforts, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Although there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system and the perception of some voters that their votes may not count, the benefits of the system outweigh these concerns. Therefore, I urge you to consider the importance of these advantages and support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will carefully consider the information presented in this letter. I hope that you will support the continuation of the Electoral College as it has served our nation well for over two centuries.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"We are very close to Venus and Mars, and at some points we are closer to Venus than Mars and vise versa. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an idea that they want to send humans to Venus to study this planet, but there is a lot of dangers involved if they do that. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving all the reason why humans should go, bad things that could happen if humans landed on Venus, and things they can do to make this idea work.

NASA already beleives that there could be life on Mars and that people could be living on Mars in a couple decades or even less, so why wouldn't they want to find that out about another planet. It has already been suggested that there once was life on Venus. In paragrpah 4 it states Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. NASA thinks that being on the land we would be able to study it better because they don't think peering at Venus from a ship orbiting is doing enough. It is also giving them challenges that they can work on the equipment to make it last longer.

In article the Challenge of Exploring Venus, it does state the bad outcomes if we landed on Venus and what could go wrong. In paragraph 3 it talks about the conditions on Venus for example, On the planet's surface, temperaturess average over 800 degrees Fahrenhit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. It also states that the condition on Venus are more extreme than anything humans have encountered on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in or solar system. These things are very dangerous, but despite the dangers this article is still able to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit.

In paragraph 5 they focus on things they would have to do to avoid the dangerous conditions, for example one thing is allowing scientist to float above the fray. Floating over the fray of Venus would be just like our jet airplanes. The conditions in Venus are not easy, but they would be survivable for humas. The only way to study Venus well is by being on the planet because looking at venus far away can only provide limited insight on ground conditions. Scientist want to be able to take samples from the ground and from the rocks on Venus.

The dangers of going to Venus should not stop us. It is worth it to face some of the dangers to make history and discover new things especially on another planet. The dangers of Venus will only push scientist harder to find a way to make it to venus. It will also push them to design new technology that could stand being in Venus's conditions. There is many evidence to prove that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",0
"Essay: 

Modern society has become increasingly reliant on cars for transportation, causing not only congestion in cities but also contributing significantly to air pollution worldwide. However, there is a growing trend to limit car usage and to promote more eco-friendly alternatives. By exploring various instances where limiting car usage has been implemented or suggested, we can elucidate the potential benefits to our communities, city planning, and environment.

It is significant that the majority of Vauban's residents, a suburb in Germany, do not own cars, but instead rely on non-polluting modes of transportation and public services (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). These residents are active pioneers in tackling the issues of car dependency, causing worldwide attention and setting examples for other cities. Residents express a higher level of contentment as the constant tension and worry associated with car ownership no longer concern them. The reduction in car usage has encouraged a more relaxed and peaceful environment, replacing engine roars with sounds of children’s chatter, and bicycles' whispers (Rosenthal). 

Likewise, the Colombian capital, Bogota, has initiated a Car-free day, on which private vehicles are forbidden, and commuters turn to either walking, biking, buses or taxis instead (Selsky, Car-Free Day is Spinning into Big Hit in Bogota). This initiative not only mitigates traffic congestion but also substantially reduces air pollution, a challenge conventional city life often struggles with. 

Paris enacted a partial driving ban in response to severe pollution, causing urban congestion to reduce by 60% after an intensification of smog for five days (Duffer, Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog). The simultaneous restriction on cars and introduction of free public transit services offers a powerful testament to what a commitment to reducing car usage can achieve—notably, a significant improvement in air quality. 

Lastly, a fundamental shift in American behavior has been noticed, with studies reporting that citizens are driving less, investing in fewer cars, and obtaining fewer licenses than previous years (Rosenthal, The End of Car Culture). The speculated causes for this shift range from economic reasons to changing lifestyles, facilitated by smartphones and telecommuting possibilities. This indicates an exciting potential for cultural evolution toward a less car-dependent society. 

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, such as reducing greenhouse emissions, encouraging development of public transportation, fostering community engagement, improving quality of life, and encouraging more efficient use of city space. It is pivotal for communities worldwide to recognize the significance of these benefits and work persistently towards a more sustainable way of life for a healthier planet. The examples of Vauban, Bogota, and Paris stand as strong evidence that a shift away from a car-centric culture is not simply possible, but beneficial in numerous ways. Furthermore, the changes occurring in America underline that this shift may already be underway, reinforcing the fact that reducing car usage is truly a global ambition.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: An Explanatory Essay

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote more sustainable forms of transportation. This movement recognizes that the dependence on cars in suburban areas is a major obstacle to achieving these goals. By adopting smart planning principles and creating car-free communities, like the one in Vauban, Germany, we can enjoy several advantages, including reduced emissions, improved quality of life, and a stronger sense of community.

One of the most compelling reasons to limit car usage is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article in the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint. For example, in the car-free community of Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This reduction in car ownership has led to a noticeable decrease in emissions and a cleaner environment for the community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is an improved quality of life for residents. Rosenthal describes how the residents of Vauban, Germany, have more peaceful and less stressful lives since giving up their cars. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, explains that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now she is much happier. Without the noise and pollution of cars, the streets in Vauban are filled with the swish of bicycles and the laughter of children. This car-free environment provides a more tranquil and enjoyable living experience for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can strengthen the sense of community in suburban areas. In the past, suburbs have been built around car ownership, with houses spread out and connected by extensive road networks. This type of development isolates residents and makes it difficult to interact with neighbors. However, by adopting the principles of smart planning and creating car-free communities, we can encourage more interaction and socialization among residents. In the new approach, stores are placed within walking distance, and public transportation becomes more accessible. This creates a sense of connectivity and encourages people to interact with their neighbors. As David Goldberg of Transportation for America states, All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas offers several advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving quality of life, and fostering a sense of community, we can create a more sustainable and enjoyable living environment. It is crucial that we continue to explore and implement smart planning principles in order to promote car-free communities and reduce our dependence on cars. As the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota show, this movement is already gaining traction and has the potential to make a significant impact on our society.",1
"While claims of an alien face on Mars captured the imagination, the geology tells a clearer story. 

Upon closer examination, pareidolia rather than visitation best explains the formation. The features resemble a human face solely due to our tendency to find familiar patterns amid randomness. Yet the landform's composition and context argue it arose through natural processes, not intelligent design.

For one, it aligns with the local terrain. The face sits within rocks laid down by ancient streams rather than appearing arbitrarily on smooth plains. Its layering matches neighboring mesas and buttes eroded over eons by wind. Were it carved intentionally, we'd expect a sharper delineation from the background instead of gradual merging. 

Moreover, its scale belies artificiality. At over 2 miles wide, the formation dwarfs any sculpture left by human or other known visitors. We've found no artifacts of comparable size from ancient Earth civilizations, making anthropic origins highly improbable. 

Most conclusively, spectral analysis of the face reveals it consists of the same rocks as environs—sandstone and eroded shale. Had aliens transported material to form features, we'd detect compositional variance from the local bedrock. But uniform mineral composition aligns with origin through ordinary geological forces rather than odd long-distance transport and crafting of diverse imported rocks.

In conclusion, while a product of our face-seeking minds was intriguing to imagine, careful study shows the Face on Mars arose through natural river deposition and winds rather than intelligent design. Its consistent geology, merging with the local area, and enormous scale argue it's simply another Martian mesa, without need for exotic explanations. Understanding how perception can shape perception is key to uncovering nature's real stories amid Hubble's lens.",1
"Have you ever needed someones opnion about something but didnt know who to ask? Do you not know if you should ask your parents, teachers, or friends? Most of the time people only ask one or two people, but thoes spific people might not always be able to give you the best advice. When makeing a choice it is better to ask mutipule people for their opinion rather then just asking one person.

Whenever you are trying something new wither that be a new food or if you should on vacation to a place you've never been before you should always ask multipule peoples opions. For instnce, if you cant decide wither or not to join the school soccer team and you only ask one person who is on the team they will tell you that you should join. However if you ask someone who is not on team they will probley tell you difrently. So if you ask for multiple people for their opinion you are doing they best thing you can do for yourself.

When you ask multipule people their opinon they will most likely all have diffrent advice for you baced on their past experiences.

For example, when I was going to californa I asked all my friends who have been there befoere where I should eat. Most of my friends told me their favorite restarants there, but one of my friends told me not to go to this one little beach hut restorant where they serve fresh sea food. She told me not to go their because when she went there with her whole family they all got food poisning and had to cut their vacaison short. I was very greatful for that advice because if my family had gone their and gotten sick and had to go home early I would have been very upset.

So in conclusion, if you ever need someones opinon on something it is better to ask multiple people rether then one person so that way you will get the best advice. That way you can learn from peoples mistakes and not make the same ones. You can also find out what the best opsion is for you in any situation.",0
"All around the world, cars have influence our lives for the good or for the bad. Whether that is getting people to their jobs or getting into an accident. Cars have altered our lives and are doing it constantly. Although for a century cars have benefited humans greatly, cars have negative effects and banning cars can help decrease the pollution all over the world, it saves the little resoucers the planet has, and car accidents will occur less.

To elaborate more, countries all over the world are trying new ways to decrease the air pollution as much as possible, whether that is banning cars or restricting them. In Vauban, German cars are restricted and if you have a car it is very expensive to use. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not have cars, and inorder to move in to the town 57 percent sold their cars. The idea of restricted areas are getting big ,and for Vuaban has 5,500 residents, that shows that people like the idea and will support it. People in the town have claim to enjoy it alot and are happier. In Paris, France their idea to help low the pollution in the air was to have specific licenses plats restricted on certain days of the week. France had very bad smog and within 5 days the smog decrease 60 percent. In Bogota, Columbia they had similar goals as other countries like Germany. Carlos Arturo Plaza said,It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. In Europe cars make up 12 percent of the greenhouse gas and air pollution. In the United States Americans are driving less and the pollution in the air is decreasing, benefiting the environment. Throughout the world, countries are tring to help the world, by decreasing the pollution.

Moreover, throughout the century cars have been using non renewable resoucers and now that alot of the people have cars, it has taken a toll on the environment. The world has only so much resoucers and once its gone it is gone, it takes time for them to come back and it willl not be in our life time. Using these resoucers have a negative effect they emit carbon in to the atmosphere creating greenhouse gas, that is bad. saving the resoucers and not using them can help with keeping the atmopshere cleaner.

Now people are banning and restricting cars for various reasons, but one reason is that for the past century cars have killed alot of people. It is one of the top reasons for deaths in the United States and possibly in the world. If banning cars can save thousands of lifes why not do it. Banning cars or restricting cars means less cars which can result to less car accidents. Having less accidents results to less people getting hurt and potenially dying. Less cars can also mean that the goverment does have to focuse on roads and stuff like that ,but can focuse on improving the safty of the people on the sidewalks or at playgrounds. the funds can go to better causes.

The world we live has changed enormously and now inorder to save the plant and the people in it, we must make changes as a society, inorder to live long and healthy. Banning cars might be one of the many choices we must make inorder to live. Banning cars can help decrease the greenhouse gases, conserve the resoucers, and less people will die from car accidents. Who knows cars may be a thing in the past int he next decade or two.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. As outlined in the passage set, there are various benefits to adopting a lifestyle that relies less on cars and more on alternative modes of transportation. These advantages include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, enhanced physical and mental well-being, and the creation of more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the roads, we can make a substantial impact on lowering these emissions, which contribute to climate change. This is particularly important given the current global environmental crisis we are facing.

By reducing the number of cars on the roads, we can decrease the pollution caused by vehicle emissions, resulting in cleaner and healthier air for everyone. This is not only beneficial for the environment but also for individuals who suffer from respiratory issues or allergies.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on our physical and mental well-being. The passage set discusses how residents of car-free communities reported feeling less tense and happier without the constant stress of car ownership. Walking, biking, or using public transportation as alternative modes of transportation can provide opportunities for physical exercise and reduce sedentary lifestyles. This can lead to improved physical fitness and overall health.

Moreover, limiting car usage can contribute to the creation of more sustainable and livable communities. By reducing the reliance on cars, cities and suburbs can be designed in a way that is more accessible to public transportation, walking, and biking. Stores and services can be located closer to residential areas, making them easily accessible without the need for a car. This type of smart planning, as mentioned in the passage set, can create vibrant and connected communities where people can live, work, and play in close proximity.

Overall, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, enhanced physical and mental well-being, and the creation of more sustainable and livable communities. By adopting alternative modes of transportation and promoting smart planning, we can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future. It is essential for individuals and communities to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and take steps towards embracing a car-free lifestyle.",1
"The electoral college system is better than the popular vote system because every citizen should have a say in who is running the country they are living in. Also, if not everyone has a say in who their president is there would probably be claims of discrimination towards the government for not letting those people vote. There would,as well, not be a standard that could be set that everyone agrees on because the people excluded would not accept it. Popular vote hasnt worked in the past and it wont work now either.

If we chose the popular vote system it would never work out because there would always be people,mostly the ones excluded from voting, that would disagree with the system in general and the standard set on who can or can't vote. For example,in colonial times only white men who owned land could vote and I am sure that the african americans and the women and even the white men who didn't own land were not too happy with that standard. Of course if we had the popular vote system today,the standard would definitely have to be changed but the people who are excluded wouldn't like the system at all.

In the electoral college system everyone who would like to gets a say in who is running their country and pretty much nobody has a problem with it. It is also much easier to count the vote's of 586 votes from the electoral college than like half a billion from cictizens in america. Another two reasons that the electoral colege system is better than the popular vote system.

In the colonial times there were slaves and only 1 out of every 4 votes from slaves counted and that was very discriminative but it was how it was back then but think,if we adopt the popular vote system, what would happen if only white and black people could vote or only white men. There would be udder chaos in America and there would be wrongful deaths and crimes. I would get mad too if i was put in a spot where i was not allowed to vote but some people would take it to the extreme and it probably wouldn't stop until the standard was amended.

In conclusion, the popular vote system is all around a bad idea and it would cause nothing but bad times. Keep the voting system the same because everyone seem's to like it so dont fix it if it's not broken. That is why we should not change or fix the voting system in America.",0
"Title: Limiting Car Usage: A Pathway to Sustainable Urban Living 

Our current society has metamorphosed into an era of rapid urbanization, invariably buttressed by immense reliance on private vehicles. This pattern has generated an alarming increase in environmental pollution, presented challenges in urban planning, and induced significant health risks. It is against this backdrop that the concept of reducing car usage has been propounded, thereby fostering sustainable urban living.

The residential district of Vauban in Germany presents an intriguing instance of successful car limitation. According to Rosenthal (2009), users are required to purchase parking spaces separately from their homes, making car owning less appealing. Consequently, a significant proportion, almost 70% of Vauban’s families, do not own cars. By minimizing car usage, Vauban generates lower greenhouse gas emissions – a critical contributor to climate change. This strategy is also crucial in tackling tailpipe emissions, which amount to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in car-centric regions in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009).

Prolonged car usage also engenders devastating air pollution issues, as seen in Paris during a period of near-record pollution. To combat this, city officials implemented a partial driving ban, resulting in a remarkable 60% decrease in congestion and a significant reduction in the smog level (Duffer, 2014). A similar strategy was deployed in Bogota, Colombia, where a car-free day led to the streets being notably devoid of traffic jams (Selsky, 2002). These practical scenarios strongly indicate that reducing car usage indeed fosters a healthier environment, characterized by fewer greenhouse gases and less air pollution.

Less reliance on vehicles does more than improving the environment; it also significantly enhances our quality of life. Vauban’s 'car-free' streets are safer and more peaceful, creating a more conducive environment for walking and biking (Rosenthal, 2009). Limiting car usage also encourages more use of public transportation, promoting collective communal experiences and ultimately fostering a more socially cohesive community.

Moreover, there's a growing trend, especially among younger generations, towards lesser car ownership and driving (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend is driven by factors such as increased access to public transportation, the feasibility of telecommuting due to advances in technology, and changing social attitudes that prioritize sustainability. Correspondingly, there's evidence of auto companies diversifying their offerings by pitching themselves as mobility companies, reflecting an acknowledgment of this ongoing shift (Rosenthal, 2013).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages to both our environment and quality of life. The experiences of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota point towards a sustainable urban future where reduced car usage characterizes our transportation habits. Furthermore, younger generations are naturally adopting these patterns, implying that this trend is likely to continue. Therefore, as inhabitants of this shared planet, it behooves us to adopt strategies that promote less car use and push for sustainable urban living.",1
"First impressions are a funny thing – they often stick with us and have a huge impact on how we perceive someone. However, it is important to remember that first impressions can be wrong, and it is not possible to judge someone's character based on the few limited points of view we have of them early on. Everyone has the right for their character to be judged on its own merits and not by a few fleeting moments.

First impressions are based on a limited scope of facts and can often be heavily biased. We may think that a person is unkind based on a lack of politeness in an introduction, but it does not give us a full understanding of their true character. We may think someone intelligent based on their manner of speaking in an interview, but that does not tell us the full range of their knowledge. It is only by taking the time to get to know someone through meaningful conversations, spending quality time with them, and learning more about their background that we can gain a better understanding of who they are.

It is also important to remember that we all have the capacity to grow and change over time. Our beliefs and opinions can shift, and it is important to recognise this when judging someone. We must understand that nobody is perfect and that we all make mistakes. It is only through understanding and patience that can we learn more about an individual and their character. 

In conclusion, it is impossible to judge someone based on their first impressions. We must take the time to get to know someone properly and keep an open mind if we want to gain a full understanding of their character. Everyone deserves the right to be judged on their own merits and given a fair chance to prove themselves.",1
"Commuinities are essencial for all humans.

I agree with this statement. I think that young people today are too busy with their own lives to give much attention to the communities in which they live. This is why I believe that it is important for them to spend more time in the community where they grew up. It is also important that they learn about the history of their community and the people who live in it. They should also be aware of the problems that exist in their local communities and how they can help to solve them. In addition to this, they should be able to communicate with people from other communities, especially if they want to learn more about other cultures and languages.",1
"I think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. It also doesnt do any harm, so i think ther shouldnt be an agument on why they shouldnt event ths type of technology. Making these types of inventions can even be helpful not just for the Facil Action Coding system but to many other inventions. They are becoming more advanced in technology and are capable of developing more interesting inventions. Many students also some times have problems trying to fihure out what there feeling or to tell some one how they feel. I agree that the Facial Action coding System is valuable and ould be used for goods.

This technology can be used for many thing and in a very good way. For ecample like the author wrote in the article. They can make changes in many things by seeing the emotions in a sudents face. For example in some ones homwork, in a book there reading. By reading there face expresions they can use that technology for the good of a person. They can find new things and make changes. So the things that are boring or sad or anything that is making someone not be intirested in something make them more intiresting. In my opinion people that make stories or news papr aricles want there work to be seen and get many reviews. So by figuring out what some one is really intirested in is a good way know. Many people like new developments. If this type of work becomes more advanced it could be something good.

In my opinion i think its valuable. It does no harm to some one and it heps so some one could be under stood and helped. This technology could be used for many thing. Its also once more a new invention and helpful for many more. It also is a very intiresing in the way it works. Just because it was well diveloped to know how the human face works and the changes it makesevery time it has a diffirent expression. Thats why i think this development is very valuable.",0
"The ever-changing landscape of modern music is something to be admired. From the traditional folk songs that filled the air around campfires and in small villages, to the complex electronic instrumentals and hard hitting lyrics that define today's soundscape; music has been an integral part of human history for millennia. One genre of music that stands out amongst all others is hip hop and rap. Hip hop culture originated in African American communities in New York during the early 1970s, bringing a unique perspective to bear on issues such as poverty, racism, and identity. This style quickly grew from a niche underground scene into one of today's most popular genres worldwide. Unlike more traditional forms of songwriting like country or pop, rap focuses heavily on lyrics delivered over beats rather than melodies or instruments; allowing it to tell stories with clarity and complexity rarely seen in other styles. Rap artists such as Jay-Z have become true entrepreneurs through their ability to craft foundational ideas about social issues into timeless works of art while simultaneously capitalizing off their success within markets beyond just music (e.g., clothing lines). The emergence of this kind specific form of expression opened up opportunities not only for people of color but also allowed messages otherwise unheard by mainstream media outlets gain exposure due to its immense popularity across multiple generations throughout both urban neighborhoods and suburban homes alike. Even now there continues to be a strong representation when it comes topics involving political injustices faced by minorities where many rappers are becoming more socially aware then ever before without sacrificing any creative integrity along way - furthering progress made by previous forerunners in hip hop movement who strived for musical excellence above all else. At its core, rap allows those from disadvantaged backgrounds have a platform express their concerns more directly than was previously possible through any other medium – providing them voice at time where society’s collective attention may be needed most desperately yet available least easily accessed avenues ebb away slowly but surely each day passed unnoticed until after fact already set",1
"Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

Thank you for reading my letter. I hope it finds you well. I am currently a junior at Generic_School. I believe that the students should commit to career at a young age because. career can show how creative students can be, and have a had start to choose their careers before they get out of high school.

First, I would like to talk about how creative students can be in their career. When school. For example, I would like to express myself through my art to show my emotions and I love to excess myself through my art. It makes me feel happy but if I don't start choosing my career at a young age then how am I going to know what I want for my career and the students won't know what they want for their career when they get out of high school and that's how I would like to express myself through my career.

Also, about students having a head start to choose their career at a young age. for example, I would not know what to choose if I didn't start in high school it would be a waste of time for me to find a career if I didn't start at a young age, if I started at school then there won't be a problem for me to find one also I would rather start now then later on in my life and how Am I going to express myself if I don't have a career to start with thats why students should think a head of choose their career.

Last, students should think about what they want to do or be when they grow up because schools can help with your career when you need it, they can put you in a class where you want to learn about the career that you choose and it will make is so much easier for the student to start now. for example, if I where to choose a career I would have to tell my teachers what classes that I what to take for my career chooses it can help a lot of students with their career chooses it would be a problem for them to tell the teachers what careers they want and it would be more easier for them to start telling the teachers what career they want and put students in the class they want to take for their career but they have to trust their teachers first then they can tell the students what careers that they what to take or what good classes are good for this career that the student chooses and that's my opinion on students should be commit to a career at a young age.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my thoughts about career chooses that means so much to me and thank you again.

Sincerely,

"Being a good person and a good citizen are two important qualities that people should strive for in life. By researching these qualities, one can gain insight into how their own problems can affect their career, and how exhibiting good behaviors can help them in life. It is also important to be a good student in order to gain credit for college, as well as to be responsible and work hard to complete goals. Lastly, helping other people can make a huge impact, and demonstrates good behavior. It can be as simple as offering a lending hand to a neighbor, or donating to a local cause. All in all, developing and exhibiting qualities of a good person and citizen are essential for a thriving and successful life.",1
"What the Facial Action Coding System is a  process begins whe the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more mucles is called a action unit. The man thing is weather or not this Facial Action Coding Syste should be used to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valube . But there can be some good things about this and there can be some bad things about this. The pros is id the computer can read if the kid is strugling with somthing and the teacher could come help the kid. Also the computer can read if the kid is depressed and needs help with somthing going on in his or her life. The cons isinvasion of privice. But with all these pros and cons I think we should have the Facical Actions Coding System.

My first reason why we should have these computers is for school. In the artical the author says A classroom computer could recognizewhen a student is becoming confused or bored. What this means if a kid is stuggling or confused the computer can read that the kid is in need of help on the thing he is working on and the teacher can come help the kid. Also the good thing is if the kid is confused and needs help, but if the kid is shy or scared to ask qustions the computer can tell the teacher he or she needs help on what they are working on. Last if the computer knows the person in confused the computer can stop what the kidis doing and help that person on what they are doing. This is my first reason on why we need this computer system in all schools.

My second reason is the computer can read kids emotions and can help the person.  In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of corse, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. This shows if a person is depressed and needs help but is scared to tell anybody the conputer can tell that friend so that friend can help that person out. Also this can tell if a person is angry and the actions that person could do when they are angry helping that person out and other people around them, beacuse of the actions that person can do while they are mad. Last this device can save lifes of people who think of suicide beacuse the computer can warn peopel these sighns helping the person out and many more people. This is my second reason why all schools should have the computer system.

My third and last reason is the computer can help that person be happy if they are sad and depressed. According to Facial Feedback Theoryof Emotions Putting on a happy face actually works! Also  imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnt. What this is saying is if you are watching somthing and ad comes on and it makes you happy the computer know that you like if and it would more like that. But if a ad comes on you dont like it and frown the computer knows that and will change it fast so you stay happy. With this computer doing that it could keep a lot of kid happy. This is my third reason why all schools should have this computer system.

Some people my not agree with me. Some people may say that it is advading your privace. But I think the computer should beacuse the computer can svae lives. Also help kids learn. Last it can keep kids happyand not sad. With the computer doing all of this we can keep a healthy life style and a safer envoroment for every body. This is why all schools should have this computer system to save lifes, help kids, and keep kids happy.",0
"Do i think we should use this technology on students? Yes i think we should use this technology on students beacause then you might be able to prent fight suicide and more. Ithink its valuable because, if a student is going through a rough time and you use this program you would be able to fidout whats wrong and try to help them.

The other reason why it would be valuable is beause you can help students with bullyin to help them fom getting hurt and not wanting to continue their education due to mean people and neglagence. On top of that we can find out so much me about ur emotions if we were to san teenage minds going through adolesence because they are hanging constantly.

Therefore scanning our emotions will help us find out so much about the human phycological aspect with our emotions. With emotions once we figure out what makes up emotions we will probably mak a robot that can think and feel like a human.

See now the reason why itwouldnt be a good idea is beause it could stress the kids out and make their time worse in schools and in the public life. If we were to let a computerscan the teenagers emotions they might feel scared uncomfratable nd more and they might not do it.",0
"When it comes to the role of family dynamics in childhood obesity, there is an undeniable link between the two. Research has proven that parents and other caregivers who are not supportive or provide unhealthy environments can contribute to the development of obesity in children. A familial environment that is highly focused on pleasing others and providing material items instead of showing proper nutrition habits or encouraging physical activity can be detrimental to a child's health. One way families can prevent childhood obesity from occurring is by having regular conversations about healthy food options and physical activities. These conversations should include topics such as the importance of eating nutrient-rich foods like fruits and vegetables rather than junk food, limiting screen time, participating in outdoor activities, setting attainable goals for exercising regularly, etc. Parents need to emphasize how these messages will benefit their child's overall wellbeing while also respecting any opinion they may have on certain lifestyle choices that could impact their weight status. Another important factor when it comes to preventing childhood obesity in families is creating a positive home environment without judgement or criticism regarding body image issues — particularly with young girls who tend to struggle more with self-esteem issues related to weight gain due to societal pressures placed upon them at an early age. It's essential for caregivers within a household to promote acceptance no matter what size or shape someone may be so children do not feel ashamed if they put on additional pounds due solely genetics or puberty changes for example. Finally, having frequent check-ins with your pediatrician concerning your child's growth rate will help you identify any potential problems before they become serious enough warrant medical attention from specialists outside your primary care physician office . This step also allows you track trends over several visits; this will give you peace of mind knowing whether changes made within your household during this time frame had any affect either positively or negatively on their Body Mass Index (BMI). In conclusion, family dynamics play an integral part when it comes down preventing childhood obesity through education , support , communication and monitoring .",1
"The Electoral College is a very useful and easy was of voting. According to thee article What Is thee Electoral College by thee Office of thee Federal Register, The Electoral College process consists of thee selection of the electors, thee meeting of thee electors where theey vote for President and Vice President, and thee counting of thee electoral votes by Congress. Basically we vote for our electors which theen theey vote for thee President which seem to be working just fine why change it?

There are many resons why people are in favor of changing thee Electoral College for popular vote. In thee article Why even thee bestlaid defenses of thee system are wrong by Bradford Plumer he asks Can voters control whom theeir electors vote for? Then answers himself withe Not always.

"Phones and Driving

Cell phones are a big part of people's lives, most people need their phones with them at all times. The use of cell phones have took a toll on many people lives. Phones are definitely a distraction to people especially when they are driving. Using a cellular device while driving a vehicle is dangerous to your life and other innocent lives around.

Since 2010, there have been 14 states that have banned the use of cell phones while driving. Driving while using your phone can cause the driver to forget to turn on blinkers or maybe watch for people merging lanes. Studies show that drivers on there phones are the cause of about 6 percent of accidents in the U.S. Killing about 2,600 and injuring 330,000 people each year.

Researchers also say that the cost of accidents caused by use of cellphones is about $43 billion. So not only is the use of cell phones while driving a vehicle dangerous, it also costs billions due to the accidents it causes.

People often think that just texting and driving is dangerous, but some researchers say that talking on the phone can be just as dangerous if not more than texting while driving. Using your phone while driving is dangerous and illegal, it can wait it's better to be safe, don't use your phone while driving.",0
"In recent years, the popularity of subscription boxes has grown exponentially. These packages bring a sense of excitement and surprise as they come in all shapes and sizes, offering everything from clothes to beauty products to coffee beans. While subscription boxes certainly have their benefits, there are also some drawbacks that should be considered before signing up for one. The most obvious benefit of subscribing to a box is convenience; you don’t need to go out shopping or travel around looking for items when your box arrives right at your doorstep. Not only does this save time but it can also help people who aren’t necessarily tech-savvy understand the concept better than if they were trying to purchase something online on their own. Additionally, many subscriptions offer discounted prices compared to regular shopping prices which can be helpful when living on a budget. However, despite these advantages there are still some potential downsides worth considering before purchasing a subscription box service. Firstly, it is important to take into account that what comes inside each box isn’t always up to par with expectations; sometimes you might get something that isn't quite what you wanted or expected and refunds can be difficult as well as costly depending on the company policy so make sure you read the terms carefully before deciding whether or not it's worth signing up for. Secondly, in order for companies producing these services turn any kind of profit they need people buying them every month meaning consumers could end up spending more money than intended once interest takes hold and stick with it even if they're not entirely happy with the product quality or selection within each box delivered monthly/quarterly etc. All in all though subscription boxes can offer an interesting experience especially those tailored towards specific interests like foodies or fashionistas since such items tend usually able come with discounts too! Ultimately its best weigh both pros & cons first then decide whether its really worth investing in one - afterall its going cost money either way regardless of how enjoyable/convenient receiving",1
"Modern technology has undoubtedly made our lives more convenient in many ways. From smartphones to smart homes, technology has made it easier for us to communicate, work, and live our daily lives. However, some people argue that life was better when technology was simpler. In my opinion, I believe that modern technology has made our lives more convenient, and I will explain why in this essay.

Firstly, modern technology has made communication much easier and faster. In the past, people had to rely on letters or telegrams to communicate with each other, which could take days or even weeks to arrive. Nowadays, we can communicate with anyone in the world instantly through social media, email, or video calls. This has made it easier for us to stay in touch with our loved ones, no matter where they are in the world.

Secondly, modern technology has made it easier for us to work and be productive. With the rise of the internet, we can work from anywhere in the world as long as we have a laptop and an internet connection. This has made it easier for people to work remotely, which has led to a better work-life balance for many people. Additionally, technology has made it easier for us to automate repetitive tasks, which has freed up more time for us to focus on more important tasks.

Lastly, modern technology has made our lives more convenient in many other ways. For example, we can now shop online and have our purchases delivered to our doorstep, which saves us time and effort. We can also use technology to monitor our health and fitness, which helps us to stay healthy and active.

In conclusion, I believe that modern technology has made our lives more convenient in many ways. While some people may argue that life was better when technology was simpler, I believe that the benefits of modern technology far outweigh the drawbacks. Technology has made it easier for us to communicate, work, and live our daily lives, and I believe that it will continue to do so in the future.",1
"Knowledge is an undeniable key to success. Many of the greatest minds throughout history have proven this to be true, especially in the modern world. With knowledge, people are able to confirm theories and construct pathways to progress. On the other hand, imagination has its limitations. While it has the potential to spark innovation, imagination alone cannot lead to certainty or progress without the application of knowledge. 

Take, for instance, the impact of the printing press on the expansion of knowledge in Europe. Before its invention in 1440, Europeans had to rely on handwritten texts, limiting the spread of knowledge. However, Gutenberg’s invention of printing technology revolutionized the way knowledge is distributed, enabling Europeans to access and record knowledge more quickly and accurately. This is just one example of how knowledge has been used to bring progress to our world.

In contrast, imagination does have its benefits. It has the capacity to provide fresh ideas and break the status quo. It can act as a catalyst for creativity and exploration. Yet, without a basis of knowledge, these ideas can remain just as stagnant as a wild thought. 

Ultimately, knowledge is essential for turning imaginative dreams into reality. It is the monument which plans and ideas are built on. No great achievement was ever accomplished without the application of knowledge. Therefore, it is clear that knowledge is more valuable than imagination alone.",1
"I feel that this learning program can hep younger and older students and have a very big a effect on the people involved in the program, that is taking place in the schools.

Not many many other schools have this program to get extra help and kids need to understand that the there is a big opportunity that is being given to them and they need to take it.

This program helps the younger students get a opportunity to get better at something that they are having a hard time on inside of school.

If the kids are having a hard time on doing work at home or not understanding, they dont have to get worried about there grades dropping because there are other options that you can do.

If the younger kids parents do not have that much time to sit and help them with work, then they can just get help from the learning program that happens at there school.

The more you go to the meetings the better you will get even if it takes time.

I also feel that this could be important to the older kids that help as well.

This program would do very good for their service hours for there service hours for school.

It must be a good feeling for them because they were chosen to do something they are good and smart at.

They could possibly put this program on there college resume if they would like to become a teacher when they grow up.

There are many other reasons that this program could be helpful to others.",0
"In today's world, cell phones have become an essential part of our lives. They are not only used for communication but also for various other purposes like navigation, internet access, and entertainment. However, the use of cell phones while driving a vehicle has been a controversial issue. Some people believe that drivers should be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle, while others argue that it is a dangerous practice that should be banned. In my opinion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving can be a major distraction for the driver. When a driver is talking on the phone or texting, their attention is diverted from the road, which can lead to accidents. According to a study, using a cell phone while driving increases the risk of a car crash by four times. Moreover, drivers who use cell phones while driving are more likely to miss traffic signals and road signs, which can result in serious accidents.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving can also be a distraction for other drivers on the road. When drivers see someone using a cell phone while driving, they tend to get curious and try to see what the driver is doing. This can cause them to lose focus and increase the risk of an accident.

Lastly, the use of cell phones while driving is illegal in many states and countries. In the United States, many states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. Some states even have laws that prohibit the use of hands-free devices while driving. This shows that the use of cell phones while driving is considered a serious safety concern by lawmakers.

In conclusion, the use of cell phones while driving should be strictly prohibited. It is a dangerous practice that can lead to accidents and put the lives of the driver and others on the road at risk. Instead, drivers should focus on driving safely and avoid any distractions that can take their attention away from the road.",1
"Dear, Senator There are many ways in keeping the change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a difficult process to go through. The Electoral College consists of the electors, where they vote for the President and the Vice President and also the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Electoral College is unfair, outdated to the voters, by using the election by popular votes for the president of the United States is fair to voters because they get to choose the person to run the office for four years.

To begin with, in favor keeping the change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is very helpful for the voters to vote easily to choose and listen to the candidates to see who will be great to the world. In source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner in paragraph 20 states, Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decided the election. What this quote is trying to say that letting the voters choose and listen to the candidates very carefully to decide on the election, who will be helpful. Letting voters vote are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and that they will received the most information and attention from the candidates. By arguing keeping the popular votes for the president of the united States is very fair to the voters.

Furthermore, the people such as the voters help choose the state's electors when you are voting for the President. For example, in source 1: What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the federal Register in paragraph 6 say, You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. This quote explains that the voters get to choose the President but it's actually voting for the candidate's electors. It's more easier keeping the popular vote for the president of Unites States instead of keeping the Electoral College because its a difficult process to go through.

Its true that election by popular vote for the president of United States is a good argument for the voters to choose wisley. As this can be seen as in source 2: The Indfensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer in paragraph 9 states, This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. For example, in the 2000 U.S presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election by receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 226. By keeping the popular vote for the President of the United States is more easier for the society instead of using the Electoral College.

In Conclusion, why keep the Electoral College, when you can you use the popular vote.

So by keeping the popular votes is useful to let these people vote on who they want to choose. So by other people perspective, you should keep the popular votes.

"The idea of always striving to do something in order to improve one's life is a widely accepted view that is here to stay. Those who do not take action at some point in their lives and instead choose to sit and wait for something to happen are much less likely to reach success. Examining successful individuals is a great way to illustrate this point. For example, Oprah Winfrey grew up with little opportunity and faced immense poverty growing up; however, she pursued every opportunity she had, and became one of the most successful individuals in the world. Not only did she become the first African-American billionaire, she also created many platforms to help empower women around the world. 

Opposing this view, some may argue that taking action is not the sure-fire way to reach success. This is, however, an incorrect view to take. If we look back at examples in history, there is a clear correlation between taking action and reaching success. Furthermore, if we look at our own lives, any time we took action we moved closer towards our goals. Whether in school, at work, or even in sports, we can identify times when we moved closer to success because of action.

In conclusion, the idea of taking action in order to reach success is valid, and it is proved time and time again by history and our personal experiences. Sitting and waiting for something to happen will almost never lead to success; rather, taking action as consistently as possible is much more likely to bring us closer to reaching our goals.",1
"Limiting Car Usage: Environmental and Community Benefits

There are significant advantages to limiting car usage through increased adoption of public transportation, biking, and walking. Our heavy reliance on personal vehicles has negative environmental and social consequences that reduce quality of life for all citizens. Transitioning to more sustainable transportation options would help address these issues and improve our communities.

One of the major problems with high car dependency is air pollution. Personal vehicles are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, producing around 20% of the carbon dioxide and 70% of the nitrogen oxide emissions in many cities. These emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and exacerbate the climate crisis. They also produce smog that causes respiratory illness, especially impacting children and the elderly. Reducing car trips would clean up our air and benefit public health.

Traffic congestion is another issue that results from too many cars on the road. Dependence on vehicles for most trips clogs our streets and wastes people's time stuck in traffic. This costs our economy billions each year in lost productivity. Developing walking, biking and public transit as alternatives could alleviate congestion by taking many drivers off the roads during peak hours. With fewer vehicles, commutes would be quicker and more reliable for those who need to drive. Less traffic also makes our streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists. 

Sustainable transportation promotes livability and community. Walkable neighborhoods with good transit access allow people of all ages and abilities to get around independently. This fosters chance encounters and interaction between neighbors, building stronger social ties. Having public spaces not dominated by traffic and parking makes cities more pleasant places to live. Supporting biking and walking helps reduce obesity rates by encouraging daily exercise. Shifting modes also means fewer vehicles are needed over time, freeing up funds and urban space currently used for parking.

In conclusion, limiting car usage through developing public transit and making active transportation safer and more convenient would yield widespread benefits for both the environment and the livability of our communities. A more balanced transportation system supports sustainability, public health and quality of life for all citizens. Investing in these alternatives should be a priority to address challenges like pollution, congestion and social isolation. Doing so would leave us with cleaner air, less traffic, stronger communities and a more secure future.",1
"Dear Senator of Florida,

I strongly believe that we have to change the way we vote because the Electoral College is a horrible way to vote. It is not fair one bit and i think we should vote for the candidates that deserve to truely win. Not have it where we vote for someone but we actually are just voting for a slate of 34 electors who are pledged to the runner.

Electoral college has so many disagreements, but then it has agreements. This way of voting avoids run-off elections because if two candidates had the same amount of popular votes then they look at the electoral votes and it helps them know who is the winner. In large states they try to do electoral votes becuase it gives the presidential candidates more attention in a campaign than smaller states do.

Then we have the disagreements and they are pretty good logical points. When we use this system we dont vote for the president we are only voting for a slate of electors that elect for the president themselves. This just basically in my eyes looks like a cheat election and it shouldnt even count. Another thing is this method of selecting our president turns off potential voters for a candidate that has no intension of carrying for their state. Some people just vote to vote so they dont care of what might happen to their surroundings but then there are people that are voters and care and want to express a political preference other than the people that think a single vote will decide an election.

Electoral Votes get overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The electors are the ones that are voting not the people. This is all wrong i believe that we should vote for the president by popular vote. Its more fair and efficent. There wouldnt be anymore cheat elections. It would be the people voting finally!",0
"There is no question that successful people try new things and take risks. This is one of the essential ingredients of success. Without taking risks, it is impossible to achieve anything new or different. The status quo will always remain the status quo unless someone is willing to take a risk to change it.

There are many examples of successful people who have taken risks. One of the most famous is Steve Jobs. Jobs was willing to take risks that others were not. He was not afraid to fail. He was not afraid to try new things. This is what made him so successful. He was not content with the status quo. He wanted to change the world. And he did.

Another example is Richard Branson. Branson is another successful person who is not afraid to take risks. He has started over 400 companies. Many of these companies have failed. But he has also had many successes. He would not have had any of these successes if he had not been willing to take risks.

There are many other examples of successful people who have taken risks. This is because taking risks is essential to success. Without taking risks, it is impossible to achieve anything new or different. The status quo will always remain the status quo unless someone is willing to take a risk to change it.",1
"I believe most of the students prefer to work alone, but I prefer to work with a group because we have more ideas and we can finish our work faster.

One of the reasons, I like to work in group when we are doing a project or classwork for English class is because I know my classmates and working together we can share more ideas of how we are going to create a magnificent project and impress our other classmates and specially to you our great teacher.

The other benefit will be to finish our work faster because everyone in the group will collaborate with some work that it will help us to finish the work without worrying to turn in the project late because we will help each other to get the work done and get a good grade as a group.

On the other hand, most of my classmates prefer to work by themselves because they do their project the way they wanted to create it and they like to have just their ideas in their work. Also, they don't like to be working with classmates who are only playing and not taking the work serious.

Overall, working with a group shows, how the students or other people become more successful not only in a business, but in classes too you can get good grades and have done an excellent work. Team work not only help you to get more abilities and ideas to work with partners, but also helps to create a strong and unique friendships.",0
"Korean parents, who has traditionally shown huge intersts on childern's education, seem to be competing to send their chidren to most munber of private academies.

I don't agree with this statement. I believe that students should learn as much as they can about the world around them, but they should also learn how to think for themselves. They should be able to make up their own minds about what is right and wrong, good and bad, and what they want to do with their lives. This is the only way that they will develop the critical thinking skills they need to succeed in the real world.",1
"Cars are not the most important thing in our lives. Although cars are helpful, not having one can help you a lot in the long run. Having a car causes so much stress worrying about the traffic if you're going to be late for work or school, gas prices are not as low as people would like. If you had to walk everywhere or ride your bike, you could be getting a lot of exercise from it. People think having a car is so important but they dont see the positive side to it.

Many people stress out if they are not going to make it to work on time because of traffic, I know that I dont make it to school on time because of all the traffic trying to get into my school is horrible. Instead of stressing out, you can just go on a calm walk or bike ride to your destination. In the article written by, Elisabeth Rosenthal, there is a quote from Heidrun Walter saying, when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, because they had banned cars in his city. You can always find an alternative way of getting to where you need to go. If someone has a meeting to go to, they can always use the alternative of the Internet if they cant get their in time or the weather is not the best. Instead of stressing out about driving, you can walk to your destination and save money from not paying for gas.

We all know that gas prices are high and out of our budget. They've reached four dollars, that's insane! Why would anyone want to spend that money if they don't have to. There is a simple solution on saving your money that you waste on gas, and that is walking or riding your bike. Some people can afford the prices of gas but others are struggling in the economy but are to lazy to walk, nobody wants to get exercise so they drive everywhere.

Banning cars on the street is a good way to help people get exercise. If they know they can't drive, they would obviously walk or take a bike because they have places to be. It would be an effective way to get people to stop being lazy and helping their health. Some people would probably get frustrated because they have to walk everywhere but it's only helping them.

Walking or riding a bike is a good opportunity to realize the beauty of life without stressing out over bad drivers or traffic, saving money, and getting exercise. Most people would think banning cars on the street is a good idea for those few reasons. I know that it is super effective although some people may not see it until it actually changes.",0
"In today's day and age, as technology grows more and more sophisticated, the likelihood of someone owning both a car and a cellphone gets higher as the years progress, cell phones can be used for just about everything such as texting, talking, playing games, and such forth. Sadly, people are choosing to be on their phones while they are driving. Not only is this decision incredibly dull, for you could injure yourself but others as well, but there are many reasons why using a cell phone while driving is dangerous,

One of the biggest reasons why using your cellphone while driving is dangerous is that texting and driving not only puts you in danger but will put all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk, too, because you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap. Did you know that an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council? The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year(Center and Statistics, 2020) in Georgia alone. Texting and driving make you twenty-three percent more likely to be involved in an accident. Also, texting while driving will delay your reaction time more than when you are under the influence (Center and Statistics, 2020)

If you simply cannot resist the urge to check your text messages (or to simply be on your phone) while driving, take the time to pull off of the roadway and park your vehicle before picking up your cell phone.

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Quality essays will consist of an introduction, thesis statement, distinct body paragraphs, smooth transitions, and a sound conclusion.

Adhere to the standards of formal English - free of grammar and mechanical errors (proofread well).

Finally, be certain that the writing is entirely your own words.",0
"Distance learning has been rapidly growing in popularity due to its many advantages, such as having classes available from the comfort of one's own home. It can also be very convenient for students with busy schedules or those who must travel, as learning is no longer affected by physical location. Additionally, students can make use of resources such as audio and video recordings to go back and review the material if needed. 

However, distance learning also has some disadvantages. One potential concern is student motivation and engagement with learning material; without physical contact to the teacher and fellow students, some students may feel less motivated or connected to their studies. There can be difficulties with the technology and possible miscommunication between students and teachers as well. Finally, online classes can also limit students’ access to materials or resources that can only be found in a physical classroom.",1
"The Electoral College is America's current method of election. A process created by our founding fathers that consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Many Americans believe that this method is crucial because it's certainty of outcomes and the way it avoids run-off elections. However many people believe it creates more of a problem than a solution. Problems created under the electoral college system include, big states recieving more attention than small states, the disaster factor, and the winner-take-all method which causes unfairness among voters.

Each state has a different number of electors based on the number of members in it's congressional delegation. A lot of the time bigger states tend to have a larger amount of electors, for example the state of Hawaii has four while the state of texas has 38. This causes more attention to go towards the big states. Another example of this dilema is shown by an excerpt from Bradford Plumer whcih says each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, represetning 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to represent the will of the people.

The current system of election leaves room for multiple disasters to occur. Disasters such as the 2000 fiasco in which Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Another issue caused is a question of the electors loyalty to their candidate. Perhaps the Elector of a certain state decides against the election of their party and casts a deciding vote for whoever they please. This creates an unreliable system they could change the fate of an election in an instant. Even more serious issues could arise such as a state sending two slates of electors which Hawaii did in 1960.

Lastly, the Electoral College is a faulty system because of it's winner-take-all method. Most states have this method in which the winning presidential candidate is awarded all the electors. Due to this the candidates don't spend time int he states they know have no chance of winning, and only focus on tight races in the swing states. As stated in an article by Richard A. Posner During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, icluding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single ad.

All in all, the Electoral College is an unreliable system of election. It causes many issues to arise and is all around unfair to voters. Many important people such as Richard Nixon, and Jimmy carter agree that America should abolish it all together. The issues caused such as unequal attention on states based on size, unfaithfulness of electors, and an unfair winner-takes-all method prove the the Electoral College undeniably, causes more problems than solutions.",0
"Venus sounds like a really cool planet from all of the things I've read from this passage. The author has done really well in supporting this claim because he/she explained where Venus is, said why venus could be very challening to explore, and what NASA can try to do to complete the challenging exploration of venus.

My first reason of my the author has done on this claim is that he/she explained where Venus is located in space. according to the passage Venus is the second planet from the sun. Also it is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and the closest in distance. It is said that both Venus and Mars are Earth's planetary neighbors. Earth, Venus, and Mars all orbit the sun in different speeds.

My second reason is why Venus could be very challenging to explore. It might not be a good idea for humans to got to Venus because it could be really hostile for people. NASA might have a possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. In other words its not proven to be safe around Venus yet but through time NASA will firgure out a way for sure if Venus is safe for us nor not.

My last reason is what NASA can try to do to complete the challenging exploration of Venus. It is said as of now that scientists are seeking a way to get close and personal to Venus despite the risks. They are trying to find a way to make our vehicles to last longer to get more information on Venus. They are also working on other approches to studying Venus. NASA has old computers called mechanical computers. Mechanical computers were created in the 1800's and played a big role in World War 2.

In conclusion, the author has done a fantastic job on getting information on whats going on with NASA and Venus. Venus isn't confirmed on being a planet that we can live on but NASA is doint their best to see that they can do in order to see if we can.",0
"When people seek for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. The reasoning behind this is, that one person can give better advice, the other can be easier to understand, and the person asking for advice possibly wants more information from more than one person for more information.

Some people always look for the best advice from others, but some give out bad advice with no effort put in to it. It's always better to make a pizza with all of the ingredients as some say for this reason. Having more information can be better for some people in many different ways. This can possibly help someone succeed.

Other people have some trouble understanding things sometimes. So it can be easier to understand if the advice was explained in a simple way. For example, having a younger audience can be hard to explain to them in a adult form, but keeping it simple can help you get to your point with them. Even adults have a hard time understanding, just a better way of explaining things can help others.

Getting different opinions of advice is another great way to find it. You can find some pros and cons from other peoples point of view. It's like baking a cake, what are the best things to use to the worst things to use, always look for the best of it. Advice from others can help you find more of what you want.

When people seek for advice they talk to more than one person. It can possibly help someone succeed some where in life. Explaining it in a simpler way can be easier for people to understand. Or getting different opinions from others help you more. Will you find better ways to get advice from others?, or is your own advice better for yourself?",0
"There is no one answer to this question – it depends on the individual's perspective. Some people believe that education is a life-long process, while others believe that it is something that is completed at a certain point in time.

I believe that education is a life-long process. This is because I believe that learning is a continuous journey that never really ends. There are always new things to learn, and no matter how much we know, there is always more to learn.

This is especially true in the modern world, where technology is constantly changing and evolving. The things that we learn today may be obsolete tomorrow, so it is important to always be learning and expanding our knowledge.

Another reason why I believe that education is a life-long process is because it helps us to keep our minds active and engaged. When we are constantly learning new things, it helps to keep our minds sharp and active.

This is important, especially as we get older, because it can help to prevent cognitive decline and keep our minds healthy and active. Finally, I believe that education is a life-long process because it allows us to constantly grow and develop as individuals.

We can never stop learning and growing, and education allows us to explore new interests and learn new things. This helps us to become more well-rounded individuals, and it can also help us to find new career opportunities.

In conclusion, I believe that education is a life-long process, because it allows us to constantly learn new things, keep our minds active and healthy, and grow and develop as individuals.",1
"The development of technology and its implementation in society has revolutionized the way humans live. Beginning in the late 1800s, inventors and engineers began to introduce radical new ideas that would change the world. 

One of the most notable technological advancements was the invention of the radio in the late 19th century. Pioneered by Italian physicist and inventor Guglielmo Marconi, the invention of the radio set the stage for a new way of communication, and it changed the way people consumed information. Over time, with the help of entrepreneurs such as David Sarnoff and Frank Conrad, the radio transformed the way people consumed entertainment and began to foster a global community by way of airwaves.

In the early part of the 20th century, legendary entrepreneurs such as Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla paved the way for the development of electrical power, introducing the concept to the world. This breakthrough allowed for the invention of other technologies we use today, such as computers. Furthermore, inventors such as Alan Turing and Grace Hopper worked hard to create computers and programs that could handle large amounts of data and be useful for everyday tasks. 

These advancements in technology fundamentally changed the way people live their lives. It has allowed people to access information from all over the world, form meaningful relationships, and become more productive in various areas of life. Technology has also enabled us to communicate with people from across the globe and even create artificial intelligence to help us complete jobs and tasks that would otherwise take much longer to do.

In conclusion, it is clear that the developments of technology have completely revolutionized the way humans live, and it is safe to say that it has made a lasting impact on society. Without the determination and vision of the inventors and engineers who helped create and develop these remarkable technologies, the world would not be the same place it is today.",1
"When you live in the United States, you use cars everyday, so you wouldnt understand the positive impacts of limiting car usage has on everyday life. Some small towns in Germany, Paris, and Colombia are car-free citys. In the passage

In German Susburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , writen by Elisabeth Rosental, She tells her readers that a suburb in Germany, Vauban, has street parking, driveways, and home garages generally forbidden. Rosenthal states that not having a car can actually bring happiness. 'When I had a car I was always tence. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walker.

In the second article,

Paris bans dring do to smog , by Robert duffer, he tells the reader about the struggles Paris faced with polution in the air. He states that they made a system where one day they would have even licence plate number stay home one day and the odds would stay home the next. After trial and error, They came up with a solution, And it helped the smog go away. If cars were banned completly the air we breathe would be so much cleaner, and less foggy. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescrind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

In the third passage

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , by Andrew Selsky, It talks about a car free day that takes place once a year in the town on Bogota. The passage also states that people hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work during the car free day. Selsky states that the goal of the day is to promote alternative transportation and reduse smog, Which brings back the fact that not using cars reduses polution in the ait. The other reson banning cars is a good idea is because it redused stess, because you dont have to deal with traffic, find a parking spot, or worry about being late to work because you have to stop to fill up your tank in the morning. 'It's a good oppotunity to take away stress...' said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza

The last article the End of Care Culture , written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, talks about how americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. i beleive people are finally coming to the state of mind where public transportation is the faster, easier, and more afisiant way. Another reason it is better than having your own cars is that it is safer. '...public transpotation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resousrces, lower emissions and improve safety.

The main advantages of limiting car usages are happiness, lower in polution, lower in stress, and increase in safety.",0
"Dear state senator, There should be a change in the Electoral College. It should be changed to electing presidents by popular vote. It is our right to vote for someone who would actually make changes in our society and make our lives different. The fact that we have to vote electors for those electors to choose our president, it seems unfair. Also, the purpose of voting for president is for everybody to vote not just citizens. Therefore, there should be some changes for voting.

To continue, election of presidents by popular vote should be used in the United States. If we are voting for presidents, then why should us ,citizens, vote for electors in order for them to vote for our president? As stated in source 2 The indefensible Electoral College,At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state,candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swingstates. In addition, it states in source 3 In defense of the Electoral College, No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them.

Furthermore, everyone should be allowed to vote not just citizens. The fact that not everybody are qualified citizens to vote, then the amount of votes would be vague. This process is similar to not having enough electoral votes. The votes would not be popular or in a great amount for that specific place. For example, as it mentions in source 3, Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average... There should not be any thoughtful voters deciding on the election. It makes it unfair for those who want to vote but are not allowed.

On the other hand, Electoral College could have benefits. In this process it is easier for the electors who are voting. If there is a tie in votes, then they can pass it on to the House of Representatives in which state delegations take care of the voting. At least with this process, they have their own system set up and if any problems, they know in what way it can be fixed. Unlike voting by popular vote, it can cause some problems because not everyone is allowed to vote and there could be few votes for candidates which would have a negative outcome. However, it would be the same for the Electoral College because there would be not enough electors in regions.

In conclusion, election by popular vote for the president of the United States should be used. It could change society and it will allow us to have a better living. This could give us a chance to vote and feel part of the election.",0
"It is a common saying that one person's trash is another person's treasure. This adage applies to the art of thrifting, where individuals are able to find hidden gems among seemingly mundane items and upcycle them into beautiful works of art or creations with surprising utility. Thrifting has become increasingly popular in recent years as shoppers look for unique pieces at affordable prices, while also reducing the environmental impact associated with mass-produced goods. Thrifting can be done at consignment stores, vintage shops, garage sales, and flea markets - all of which offer special finds like antique furniture and clothing from different eras. At these locations, you never know what treasures you might uncover; an old dresser could be just the perfect piece for your bedroom makeover project or a retro lamp could add flair to your living room decor. You may even chance upon rare items such as original artwork or vintage accessories that will stand out amongst ordinary store-bought pieces. The thrill of searching through stacks of secondhand clothes or rummaging through bric-a-brac at flea markets makes thrift shopping an enjoyable experience for those feeling creative enough to do some upcycling themselves. If you have basic DIY skills then it’s easy enough to give new life to worn-out garments or turn rusty antiques into chic home decorations which no one else on Earth owns! All this requires is a little bit of time and effort (as well as imagination) – transforming something discarded by someone else into something stylishly yours! With the right touch such projects will keep your living space looking fresh without breaking the bank!. Ultimately thrift shopping offers much more than simply finding deals on quality products; it provides individuals with an opportunity not only to save money but also express their creativity in unique ways while doing good for Mother Nature too!

"Success is often defined as the achievement of a goal or the attainment of a desired outcome. It is often associated with ambition, hard work, and dedication. However, success is not always achieved by doing the same things over and over again. In fact, successful people often take risks and try new things in order to reach their goals. I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

One of the most important aspects of success is the ability to adapt and adjust to changing circumstances. The world is constantly changing, and successful people must be able to keep up with these changes in order to stay ahead of the competition. Trying new things and taking risks can help successful people stay ahead of the curve and stay ahead of their competition. For example, a successful entrepreneur may take a risk and invest in a new technology or business venture that could potentially yield a high return. This type of risk-taking can pay off in the long run and help the entrepreneur stay ahead of the competition.

In addition, successful people often take risks in order to explore new opportunities. Taking risks can open up new possibilities and lead to unexpected successes. For example, a successful investor may take a risk and invest in a new company or venture that could potentially yield a high return. This type of risk-taking can lead to unexpected successes and open up new opportunities for the investor.

Finally, successful people often take risks in order to push themselves and challenge themselves. Taking risks can help successful people push themselves to their limits and achieve their goals. For example, a successful athlete may take a risk and try a new training regimen or technique that could potentially help them improve their performance. This type of risk-taking can help the athlete reach their goals and push themselves to their limits.

In conclusion, I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Taking risks can help successful people stay ahead of the competition, explore new opportunities, and push themselves to their limits. Therefore, successful people should not be afraid to take risks and try new things in order to reach their goals.",1
"Do you think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice? I feel it is important to seek multiple opinions because you can seek advice in different perspectives, you can experience different opinions not just one, and if someone didn't give you good advice then you can go to another person to see if they can give you better advice.

My first reason why it's important to seek multiple opinions is it's important to see something in multiple perspectives. It's important to seek multiple perspectives because if you just look in your perspective then you will not see different versions of how other people see the situation.

My second reason why it's important to seek different opinions is you can experience different opinions not just one. It's important to experience different opinions because if you just go to the same person then you might get tired of them and their same advice.

My final reason why it's important to seek multiple opinions is if you go to one person and they give you bad advice then you can go to another person to see if they can give you better advice. It's important to go to another person if someone gives you bad advice because if you get bad advice then it won't help you like good advice would.

The Mona Lisa Smile is a intresting article about this new upcoming production of technology. It says that in the future they could have students computers have a facial reconzation deviece in it to tell what mood there in to adjust the to whatever there feeling. I feel as if it is not needed for it to be in a learning enviroment. I think its inpratical and would be very expensive for the school to have. That could cause multiple problems just with that problem alone. What if the student wasn't even paying attention to the lesson and it causes it to register there mood but there mood isnt based off the lesson because there not paying attention so it would be invaild infomation. He states in the article it can only find out a couple emotions and boredom isnt one of them. It also poses a security threat to the students or surrounding family because if it can see faces what else would it see or even not mean to capture but does. Over all I just don't see this fit for a students use and would be to expensive anyways. It could work in a perfect world though but we don't have one of those.,0
"Small acts of kindness can have an impact on others that goes far beyond just the doer and recipient. Kindness can be as simple as offering words of encouragement, volunteering time to help others, or even just sharing a smile with a stranger. These small acts of kindness can leave a lasting impression and brighten someone’s day. 

Research has shown that providing acts of kindness leads to higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in people. In 2009, Stephen Post, director of the Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care and Bioethics at Stony Brook University, conducted a study involving 1,000 people. He found that acts of kindness, regardless of whether or not others notice them, significantly increase happiness in the people performing them. Other studies have shown that recipients of kind acts are eight times more likely to pass on that kindness to someone else than they are to pass on negative behavior, resulting in a ripple-effect of kindness that can be felt in our communities.

Having a positive mindset is key to understanding and promoting kindness, and this starts with the role that parents play. Parents must create an environment in which kindness is emphasized, and they must teach their children to be kind. This is something that requires effort and dedication; setting a good example and encouraging open discussions on how kindness can be demonstrated are great ways to foster this values in children. Additionally, research suggests that kindness is contagious and can create opportunities in people’s lives by opening doorways to positive physical and mental health benefits, improved relationships, and increased success. 

In conclusion, small acts of kindness have far-reaching impacts on both the doers and recipients, and should be encouraged. Having a positive mindset and being kind to others is an essential part of fostering a compassionate and understanding community. Kindness can create opportunities in people's lives, and parents are vital in setting an example for young generations to come.",1
"When it comes to teaching children about competition and cooperation, there are pros and cons to both approaches. On the one hand, some people believe that children should learn to compete, as it is important for shaping their intrinsic motivation and ability to achieve. On the other hand, others believe that children should be taught to cooperate, as it is more beneficial for their overall development.

Some specific benefits of teaching children to cooperate include:

- increased self-esteem and self-awareness: when children are able to cooperate and work together toward a common goal, they develop a greater sense of self-worth and autonomy. This makes them better able to handle difficult situations in the future and better coordinated overall.

- greater ability to problem solve: when children are able to cooperate and work together, they are better equipped to solve problems and take on challenges. This skill set is often critical for success in school and in life.

- better communication and collaboration: when children are able to cooperate and communicate effectively, they are more likely to form strong relationships and build successful teams.

However, there are also some disadvantages to teaching children to compete. For one, it can lead to feelings of envy and anger, as well as aggression and stress. Additionally, it can be difficult to foster cooperative behavior among children who are taught to compete.

Ultimately, it is important for parents to decide which approach they would like their children to take when it comes to competition and cooperation. It is also important to provide children with the nurturing and support they need to thrive in either environment.",1
"I think drivers should not use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It is very dangerous and distracting, and can lead to serious accidents. If a driver is busy using their phone while driving, they may not be paying attention to the road, and could cause a collision or run off the road. Texting, talking and browsing on a phone can wait until you reach your destination or pull over to a safe location. In some places it is already against the law to use a phone while driving, and I agree with this rule. Drivers need to focus on keeping themselves and others safe on the road, and using a cell phone can interfere with this goal. It's better to wait until you arrive at your destination to use your phone.",1
"The development of solar energy has been a game changer when it comes to addressing the world’s current environmental crisis. Solar energy is an affordable and reliable form of renewable energy that can provide a much needed alternative to fossil fuels. As we move into the future, solar power stands out as a powerful technology that could help reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources while also providing significant benefits in terms of cost savings and improved air quality. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are made up of panels composed of cells designed to capture sunlight and convert it directly into electricity. This process works by capturing photons from the sun, which then generate electrons through an electrical field within the panel itself. These electrons are what produce usable electric current for homes and businesses, allowing them to operate without having to rely on traditional forms of power generation such as coal or natural gas burning plants. Solar PV systems can be installed at residential or commercial scales depending on need and capacity requirements, making it a versatile option for those looking for clean energy alternatives in their lives or business operations . A major benefit associated with solar PV technology is its ability to save money over time due to its low operating costs compared with other forms of power generation like coal or nuclear sources. This reduction in cost is further fueled by government incentives meant to encourage people and businesses who choose this environmentally friendly option over traditional means; these include tax credits given by some states as well as federal grants available through certain programs like SunPower’s Renewable Energy Grant Program (REGP). Additionally, having access to clean electricity can help lower utility bills significantly since there are no fuel costs associated with solar-generated electricity once installation fees have been paid off; you only pay for maintenance instead!. . Another great advantage associated with adopting this type of renewable energy source is its potential positive impact on air quality due greenhouse gas emissions being reduced drastically since burning fossil fuels isn't necessary anymore—a particularly crucial point right",1
"Having a successful business takes more than just good ideas and hard work. Numerous factors come into play, including external factors such as the economy, which can dramatically affect a business's success. It is therefore important to consider all possible reasons why a business could fail and devise a plan to help business owners come up with ideas to ensure success. Furthermore, those who experience failure can find solace in the stories of successful people who overcame their struggles and rose to success. A great example of this is Winston Churchill, who despite suffering many disappointments and failures in his lifetime, managed to make a huge contribution to society. This illustrates the importance of perseverance and continuing to pursue goals despite any setbacks. Equally, an effective support system is essential for those going through difficult times, providing emotional and physical assistance to those who need it.",1
"The impact of technology on modern education is a topic that has recently received much attention. As the world moves increasingly towards more digital and connected forms of learning, it's important to consider the implications this will have on students' educational experiences. One major shift brought about by technological advances in education is an increase in mobility for both teachers and learners. With online resources such as lecture slides, video lectures, interactive activities and collaborative workspaces, instructors can teach from anywhere at any time - even outside the traditional classroom setting. In addition, students are no longer confined to specific geographical areas; they can access course material remotely via their devices or participate in virtual classes with peers around the globe. Another advantage associated with incorporating technology into modern teaching environments is increased customization options for both learners and instructors. Learning platforms allow educators to tailor instruction based on individual student needs, resulting in improved engagement and better comprehension rates among participants. For example, adaptive software allows teachers to adjust content difficulty levels according to each student’s abilities while also providing additional assistance where needed. Similarly, resources like gamified lessons provide fun yet challenging approaches which keep students engaged throughout their studies. Although there are numerous advantages that come along with utilizing technology within classrooms today – including convenience; personalization; collaboration opportunities; cost savings due to reduced need for physical infrastructure – there are some potential drawbacks as well. One issue related specifically to online learning is known as ‘digital fatigue’: after spending so many hours staring at screens participating in remote classes/activities during lockdowns over the past year many people have reported feeling overwhelmed or fatigued by digital tasks compared with those conducted face-to-face (despite having been more productive). This suggests that distance learning may require some adjustment periods before it becomes truly effective long-term solution – particularly when tackling certain topics or engaging certain types of learners who might find virtual settings less conducive than others do. Overall though, utilizing technology within educational contexts has",1
"In recent years, the debate about whether high school should be completed in three years has been hotly contested. Proponents of shortening the high school program argue that it would offer both students and parents much needed time and financial savings. Despite the potential benefits, there are several potential issues that could arise if all high schools were to undertake this program. Such as a reduced exposure to a variety of course offerings, placing students in a position where they are left with limited options for college preparation. 

In addition to the program changes, credit and SOL text changes would need to be implemented in order to successfully transition to a three-year program. This could include the elimination or consolidation of certain classes, requiring faculty and administrators to work together to balance the needs of each student. Ultimately, it is essential to thoroughly assess the potential benefits and disadvantages of shortening the high school program before making this decision. While the idea of completing high school in three years may seem appealing in theory, further research is needed to truly understand the implications of such a change. For now, it is most beneficial to remain with the traditional four-year high school program.",1
"I agree that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that people are becoming more environmentally conscious and are choosing to ride bikes, take public transportation, or walk instead of using cars. Additionally, many people are choosing to live in urban areas, which means that they don't need as many cars to get around.

Another reason why there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now is the fact that many of the newer models are not very fuel efficient. In fact, many of them are actually quite inefficient, which means that they will require more fuel to operate than cars that are a few years old. Additionally, many of the newer models are not very reliable, which means that they will require more maintenance than cars that are a few years old.

All in all, I believe that there will be a significant decrease in the number of cars in use in twenty years.",1
"The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College system in the United States or, alternatively, changing to an election by popular vote for the President. The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between Congress and popular vote, has served our country well for over two centuries. While it is crucial for our democracy to evolve and adapt to the changing times, I believe the Electoral College should be preserved due to its many advantages, as explained in the texts I have studied.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certain outcome and minimizes disputes over the election results. In the 2012 election, President Obama won 61.7 percent of the electoral vote, even though his share of the popular vote was only 51.3 percent. This demonstrates that the Electoral College provides a clear winner by making a candidate's victory in each state translate into a comprehensive electoral-vote victory. The certainty of outcome offered by this system is essential for a stable transfer of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the elected President represents the interests of diverse regions. A successful president must have trans-regional appeal rather than relying solely on regional support. By requiring candidates to gain support across various states, the Electoral College fosters national unity and prevents presidents from focusing solely on policies benefiting their strongholds. This balances the interests of all regions, ensuring that no state or group of states becomes marginalized.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to engage with citizens in swing states, ensuring that voters' voices are heard. In a nation as diverse as ours, it is crucial that candidates reach out to voters in states that might be undecided. This system guarantees that citizens in these swing states receive substantial attention, allowing them to make informed choices based on various candidates' policies and qualifications. In doing so, the Electoral College promotes an engaged and informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance to the political influence of large and small states. In a country where population sizes vary, the Electoral College allows large states to maintain influence by allocating more electoral votes to them. This balance is crucial, as it prevents sparsely populated states from being overshadowed by densely populated states in the electoral process. By preserving this balance, the Electoral College ensures that every state remains important in electing the President.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by producing a clear winner. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as in the elections of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has prevented the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections. This efficient and decisive nature of the Electoral College system aids in the smooth functioning of our democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has stood the test of time and continues to provide numerous advantages for our democracy. It ensures a certain outcome, promotes national unity, encourages candidates to engage with citizens in swing states, provides balance to the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These reasons, as outlined in the texts I have studied, make a strong case for retaining the Electoral College system or changing to an election by popular vote. I urge you to consider these arguments when discussing any proposals related to electoral reform.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will give careful consideration to the points raised in this letter. Our democracy is dependent on thoughtful decision-making, and I hope you will support the continued use of the Electoral College system or a viable alternative.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Citizens of the U.S. have been voting for their presidents ever since George Washington was elected. They vote because they want their voices and opinions to be heard. So they can provide ways to make their lives better. But the truth of the matter is, we don't make the decisions. The Electoral College does. They should change the election to go by popular vote of the United States. Reason being is because what's the point of voting if they won't listen and they only hand pick a few people out of the millions of others. But keeping the College would make it easier to have votes counted.

Initially, the point of voting is to be heard and to have things your way for once, but if it's falling on deaf ears, then why bother? For example, in the Indefensible Electoral college writer Bradford Plumer states that, Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. Okay lets say someone wanted to vote for the Republican, and they vote for one of the electors who pledge themselves to the Republican. We can't rely on a person's word. What if they change their mind and vote for the other? How can natural citizens know to put their faith into a random stanger. Clearly, the voter does not get a say in the matter.

Furthermore, the millions of people who vote are reduced to a small amount of people. The Electoral College consists of five hundred thirty eight electors, and Two hundred seventy is needed to decide who's president. The Office of the Federal Register. So states like New York and Nebraska only have three to six people voting since they are small. While on the other hand, California, Texas, and Florida have about thirty to sixty. And with the civilians living there, it's still not enough. Honestly, it wouldn't even matter if they voted.

On the other hand, the smaller amount of people, the quicker the U.S can get a president. In paragraph 4 of in defense of the electoral college' it's replied that, A tie is possible... but it is highly unlikely. The presidential vote in 2012 may have not been a landslide ,but at least it wasn't a tie. The small amount made it a lot easier to count the votes. And the majority of voters still got who they wanted ,so it wasn't all terrible. The electoral college hasn't all been bad.

The Electoral College has more cons than it has pros. A citizen's voice must be heard and that won't happen if only few people are heard. But votes can be counted faster if there's only a tiny amount.",0
"Traveling is a great way to explore the world and experience different cultures. While there are many ways to travel, one of the best ways is in a group led by a tour guide. I believe this is the best way to travel because it offers safety, convenience, and an opportunity to learn.

First, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a safe way to explore the world. Tour guides are knowledgeable about the area and can provide valuable advice about safety precautions that should be taken. For example, if you are traveling to a foreign country, the tour guide can provide information about the local customs and laws, as well as tips on how to stay safe in unfamiliar surroundings. Additionally, having a tour guide can provide peace of mind when navigating unfamiliar territory. Tour guides are familiar with the area and can provide directions and assistance if needed.

Second, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a convenient way to explore the world. Tour guides are knowledgeable about the area and can provide valuable information about the best places to visit and activities to do. For example, if you are traveling to a new city, the tour guide can provide information about the best restaurants, attractions, and shopping areas. Additionally, tour guides can provide assistance with transportation, such as booking tickets and arranging transportation to and from the airport. This can save time and hassle when traveling in unfamiliar places.

Finally, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is an opportunity to learn. Tour guides are knowledgeable about the area and can provide valuable information about the history, culture, and customs of the region.

Whether you are traveling to a foreign country or a new city, having a tour guide can make the experience more enjoyable and rewarding.",1
"There is no one right way to be successful in life. Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

Some of the most successful people in the world have taken risks and tried new things, even if it did not always work out. For example, Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, started out as a computer programmer and software entrepreneur. He risked his money and invested in new technology, which eventually paid off big time. Gates is now one of the richest people in the world and a philanthropist.

Similarly, Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is well-known for his investment strategies. He is known for investing in companies that are not well known by the public, and for waiting for these companies to become profitable before selling them. Buffett is one of the richest people in the world, and his investments have paid off time and time again.

These examples show that taking risks and trying new things is key to being successful. Successful people are not afraid to experiment and take risks, which is why they are often successful.",1
"What many people don't realize is that the sport of figure skating is more than just a beautiful art form; it's also an incredibly difficult and demanding athletic activity. Figure skaters must be well-coordinated, graceful athletes who possess strength, agility, endurance and flexibility. Moreover, they need to have excellent balance and control over their bodies in order to perform the intricate choreographic moves required in competition. The complexity of figure skating begins with mastering basic skills such as jumps, spins, footwork sequences and combinations. Skaters then progress to more advanced elements such as throws and lifts which require even greater levels of physical prowess and coordination between two partners—the base (who does most of the work) and the flyer (who performs acrobatic feats). Even simple steps become challenging when performed on ice; each movement requires careful technique that often leads to minor slips or falls due to lack of proper practice time or thinning ice caused by factors like humidity or temperature changes during competitions. Skills are not all that make up this highly competitive sport though—it also requires strong mental focus so that skaters can stay on top while performing under immense pressure from judges during performances at major regional events across domestically or internationally. On top of this stress is added financial burden for some competitors since securing high quality training facilities along with suitable coaches for specialized techniques are very expensive outside North American countries where free public access exists. Despite these hardships however many dedicated individuals still participate in the world-wide phenomenon known as figure skating every year because there’s simply no other feeling quite like performing a routine perfectly executed after months upon months spent mastering one’s craft–whether it be competing professionally at international championships or merely throwing out tricks for fun at local rinks around town . It takes immense dedication , hard work , discipline , patience - but above all else passion - for anyone wishing to excel within its spectacularly rewarding realm .",1
"Being oneself is an extremely important part of life, as it is the only way to truly express who you are and make a positive impact on those around you. When individuals embrace their own values, passions, dreams, and goals, they create an example for others to follow and an inspiration for change. Being yourself can show others that it is ok to be unique and different from the status quo, and to be proud of their individuality.

One positive effect of being yourself is that it can create connections with people. For example, if you share your own passions and dreams with others, others may be inspired by your drive and commitment. This connection can lead to collaboration on projects and help create opportunities in the community. By forging these connections, individuals can create a strong support system where everyone can be open and honest with each other. 

Another positive effect of being yourself is that it can help create positive change in the world. By being yourself and embodying certain values, you can show others that it is possible to make a difference. This can raise awareness of social issues and problems, and can mobilize positive action for change. It can also inspire others to become advocates for those around them. 

In conclusion, being yourself is an essential piece of life and can lead to positive change in the world. By sharing your individuality with others, you can create connections and foster a supportive community. You can also inspire others to become advocates for change. Therefore, it is important to embrace your individuality and use it to uplift those around you.",1
"Extending the hours of school and working 10 hours per day may seem like a daunting task, but it is important to investigate the potential pros and cons of this proposed change. On the one hand, lengthening students' school days could lead to an increase in academic performance and better time management. On the other hand, there is the potential for burnout among students and teachers, as well as a heightened risk of stress-related illness and mental health issues due to extended periods of learning and working. 

It is also important to compare and contrast the consequences of working four days a week versus 10 hours a day. Working four days a week would allow students and teachers a longer weekend to rest and recover, but more time in school each day could lead to better absorption of the material and increased academic performance. On the other hand, working 10 hours a day could shorten the workweek and lead to greater workplace efficiency, however it could also lead to a weaker quality of work due to fatigue and the potential for burnout. 

Working more than 8 hours a day has its own drawbacks, including a heightened risk of fatigue, stress, and depression. Even with an extended number of hours, employers and educators should consider alternative methods of breaking up the day such as flexible working hours, breaks, or reduced working hours per week.

Finally, it is important to explore the underlying reasons why teachers and students might be pursuing this model. Some might argue the longer hours provide more opportunities for learning, while others might believe the extended hours provide additional time for project work. It is important to take into account both perspectives when making decisions about school and working hours.",1
"Having a professional career is essential to living a successful and meaningful life. Most importantly, it can bring happiness not only to the individual but to the family as well. In order for this to happen, students must take full responsibility for their professional journey. It is important that students pay close attention to what they’re doing and take all the necessary steps to pursue their professional aspirations.

However, it is not enough to merely pursue and secure a professional career. Students should also stay aware of the risks associated with neglecting their responsibilities. A professional career is one of the highest forms of responsibility and can come with a tremendous amount of pressure. If a student fails to meet their obligations, whether due to lack of knowledge or a simple lack of dedication, it can lead to severe repercussions.

Overall, a professional career is on the utmost importance and comes with its own set of unique responsibilities. Students must remain fully aware of their personal goals and take ownership of their career in order to guarantee success and a happy future, both for themselves and their families. Only through diligence and hard work can a student truly realize their full potential and reach their highest aspirations.",1
"In recent years, the world has been transitioning towards a more sustainable future. This includes the development of renewable energy sources, the reduction of emissions, and the introduction of electric vehicles. As a result, I agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years’ time.

The most obvious reason for this is the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the roads. EVs are powered by electricity rather than gasoline and are becoming more widely available. They are also more efficient, meaning that they use less energy and produce fewer emissions. Furthermore, governments are incentivizing their adoption by providing subsidies and tax credits, making them more affordable for consumers. This has led to a rapid increase in the number of EVs on the roads, and this trend is likely to continue over the next two decades.

Another factor driving this trend is the increasing popularity of ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft. These services allow people to share rides, reducing the need for everyone to own their own car. This is beneficial for both the environment and consumers, as it reduces the number of cars on the roads and lowers the cost of transportation.

Finally, the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is likely to have a significant impact on the number of cars in use in twenty years’ time. AVs are vehicles that are able to drive themselves, meaning that they can be used for ride-sharing services without a human driver. This could lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of cars on the roads, as fewer vehicles would be needed to transport the same number of people.

In conclusion, I believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years’ time. This is due to the increasing number of EVs, the popularity of ride-sharing services, and the development of AVs. As a result, the world will be a cleaner and more sustainable place.",1
"Cars,the thing that all teenagers want when they turn sixteen. Driving gives a sense of freedom, but it comes with a price. Diving automotives pollutes the air with greenhouse gases. Cities like Paris, Vauban, and Bogota have some serious problems with pollution. Thats why we should limit vehicle usage.

Vauban, Germany is doing it wrong, by living in a car-free envirorment. The citizens that live here forbidden to own a car, driveway, and a home garage. There is a glimpse of light to all of you that love driving or need to drive to work. In this city, if somebody wanted to own an automotive they would have to pay an additional 40,000 dollars and live at the edge of the city limit. Pollution might be serious but you should just limit the commute to work so citizens don't have to drive so much. Think about it, if you force people that have cars to live on the city limit, but they might work in the middle of the city. I don't see the solution in that.

Paris, France, the city of love, is also the leading city in Europe of smog. passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe. (Rosenthal 5).Paris is not so bad in book compare to Vauban. Paris has assigned certain days for the drivers to drive. On one day, even license plates will drive and the odds with drive the following day. There are precausions that they take if a odd driver drives on an even day. The drive will be fined 22 euros (that is 31 american dollars).There is nothing wrong with this plan exept if some one with an odd license plate has an emergency, and needs to take care of it posthaste.

"To whom it may concern:

In today's society there is neverending controversy over a million things. Suprisingly, a lot of these controversies are centered around one single topic: Politics. One of the most prominent arguments is the one surrounding the Electoral College and its possible abolishment. How the process works is when a state votes on their candidate the state is actually electing the Electors. Most states take a winner-take-all system where the majority of votes for a candidate would determine that all the electors will vote for that candidate. Only a few states split up to Electors based on votes, and then delegate a certain number of them to one candidate and a certain number of them to the other. The electors vary in amount by the number of members in its Congressional delegation. The Electoral College is made up of exactly 538 electors, and a majority of 270 is required to elect the president.

Personally, I would argue in favor of the Electoral College and keeping it for numerous reasons. One of them being that whomever is elected, will be everybody's president. What I mean by this is that no one region can overwhelm any other regions through popular vote and elect the candidate of their choice. If you took the south-west region of the United States, there would be California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, etc. Texas and California alone hold a great amount of America's population, and could possibly overwhelm the other states with popular vote and vote in the president of their choosing. With the Electoral College in place it allows to even the playing field and avoid run-off elections providing a more fair representation of the United States votes.

Another reason is that, the candidates can then be elected honestly, by people who listen thoughtfully. With the Electoral College, there are swing states. These states use the winner-take-all-method, and are normally a toss up. Most competing candidates focus on these toss-up states to try and secure the vote for them, and as some would argue, this prevents candidates from visiting smaller states, all becuase they want the most votes, but in truth, the candidates are vistiting the swing states becuase they are thoughtful voters. The positive thing with swing states are that the voters within them, know they are a part of the deciding vote of the president. This means that they pay much closer attention to the election and things happening within it, and the candidates stances on many different topics. This allows voters in swing states to vote fairly and informatively, without over bearing politcal part bias.

On the other side of the argument are those who want to abolish the Electoral College. They pose many reasons for why they want this such as what is often called the disaster factor. This reason is based on the election of 2000 between Al Gore and George W. Bush, when Al Gore had recieved the majority of the individual votes but once taken to the Electoral College, Bush won with 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. This incident angered many people, who wondered how and it brought up the question: Can electors defy the will of the people? The answer is yes, but it's high unlikely, and very rare, if ever. Electors are made of a parties committee, and sometimes the candidates themselves. They are picked by the State Legislature, so they obviously contain knowledge in politics and are trusted by the state government to do there duty as appointed. Some argue that the incident in 2000 between Gore and Bush was a freak accident. It's quite rare and, although it has been quite close before, no such incident had occured since 1888, when the Electoral College was created, or anytime after.

In Conclusion, in favor of the Electoral College staying as it is, it would keep the country voting fairly. It would also avoid run-off elections and a region overloading the popular vote, due to the vast quantity of population. Keeping the College intact would keep citizens in swing states interested during the election, becasue they know they are the deciding vote. While aruments against the Electoral College are many, they aren't substanial enough to completly abolish a process that has worked successfully for over a hundred years and counting.

"People should not be able to use their phones while driving under any circumstances. Many people would agree that it shouldn't be allowed to use phones while driving, due to the distraction from the road, and gives you less time to react if something happens. Using a phone while driving brings more dangers to one of the most dangerous and daily tasks of a regular person.

Using your phone while driving is a distraction from the road which is really dangerous not just for the driver but those around the car. In many cases of car accidents are caused by distracted driving with phones and this is most common with teens. These car accidents aren't just dangerous for those involved but can also cause death in many incidents.

Another reason why people shouldn't use their phone while driving is because, it would give the driver shorter time to react if something happened such as a pedestrian running into the street because if you hit them it will be the drivers fault and could get into legal trouble or worse yet the driver gets into a car crash and dies. People shouldn't use their phones because it only causes trouble.",0
"What is success without failure?

I can infer that the mentioned statement Prime Minister Winston had provided has an strong point of view from many perspectives. Human behavior mostly influences in their achievements and failures throughout life. To be able to achieved your expected goals without loosing enthusiasm, and demonstrating resilience is the greatest accomplishment. I strongly agree with the Churchill's statement regardless to the critical role failure plays in life. It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes.

Accordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world.

Furthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it.

Moreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. We, as humans tend to follow other's behavior to feel accepted by society. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end.

Overall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes. A successful person is the one who have seem to dedicated their time to be able to greatly achieved their dreams.",0
"There is no one right way to be successful, as the best way to achieve success depends on what you are looking for and what you are willing to do to obtain it. However, there are some common traits that successful people share, such as being willing to try new things and take risks.

Many successful people have had to overcome considerable obstacles in their journey to success. They have had to work hard, often starting from scratch, and often facing rejection and setbacks. They have had to learn new skills, take on new challenges, and persevere through difficult times.

Successful people are not afraid to change their approach if they believe it will lead to success. They are not afraid to take risks, as they know that sometimes these risks will pay off and sometimes they will not. However, they are always willing to learn from their mistakes and move on.

Some of the most successful people in history have been willing to take risks and try new things. For example, Thomas Edison was a prolific inventor who developed many groundbreaking technologies, but he was also known for his willingness to take risks and try new ideas. Similarly, Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world and a pioneer in the computer industry, but he is also known for his willingness to take risks and experiment with new ideas.

Successful people are not afraid to change their approach if they believe it will lead to success.

Many successful people have also been known for their intelligence and their ability to think analytically. They are not afraid to ask difficult questions and to challenge conventional wisdom. They are also not afraid to take risks, as they know that sometimes these risks will pay off and sometimes they will not.

However, despite their intelligence and their willingness to take risks, successful people are not always successful. There are many factors that contribute to success, and it is not always easy to achieve success. Successful people are often determined and motivated, but they are not always lucky. They are always willing to work hard, but they are not always able to achieve their goals overnight.

In conclusion, successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks, as this is one of the key traits that defines them. They are determined and motivated, and they are not always successful, but this is not always due to lack of effort or determination.",1
"Using imagination and creativity is incredibly useful and important in many jobs and fields. Writers, artists, fashion designers, singers, and photographers are just a few examples of roles in which one must use their creative skills and imaginations. Common skills associated with these creative roles are artistic vision, storytelling abilities, musical flair, understanding of color, and the ability to craft unique ideas. For instance, fashion designer Diane Von Fürstenberg used her imagination and creative vision to dress and redefine women's wardrobes with her signature wrap-dress. Musician Kendrick Lamar utilized his rap skills to tell creative stories and deliver unique messages.

Creative thinking and the ability to imagine is not only important in the workplace but also in everyday life. One way to use imagination and creativity in everyday life is to approach a problem from a new perspective. For example, if something isn't working, think of creative solutions that could help overcome any challenges. Imagination and creativity can also be used to explore new hobbies or interests, such as painting a picture or creating a DIY project.

Under the Electoral Cololege system, we the voters (people) vote not for our president but for a slate of electors that hopefully elect the president you want. We can not controll who the elects vote for, plus we somtimes dont know the electors we are voting for. If the people of the state of Florida wants to have a Republican president but the elector wants a Democratic president then most likely thats who he is going to vote for is the Democratic candidate.

The popular vote is fair and is more likely to get sucessful persidents that people will like. It's like 

American Idole

 you have to perform good, you have to sound good, and u have to be sucessful. You have to get two out of the three judges to say yes in order for you to go to Hollywood. Same thing with the popular vote system, u have to get two-thirds of the popular vote in order to be persident. It's alot better than to worry about who your elector is going to vote for, all they care about (sadly) is the money. We look beyond the money and look at things like: Food, Education, Gas, Roads, Highways, Trade, Money,etc...

Lets make a differnce as a country and not let people do things for us because thats takeing our freedom away. Lets get rid of the dumb electoral system and lets use the popular vote becasue thats when your voice is herd and your vote counts.",0
"I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are many reasons for this, but some of the main reasons are that people are gradually becoming more environmentally conscious, there are more efficient and affordable alternatives to cars, and the technology for self-driving cars is improving rapidly.

One of the most obvious reasons for the decrease in car use is that people are becoming more environmentally conscious. Many people are aware of the problems that cars cause, from contributing to climate change to taking up space. As a result, many people are choosing to ride public transportation, bike, or walk instead of driving.

There are also many more efficient and affordable alternatives to cars available today. For example, ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft allow people to share rides with other riders, and bike-sharing programs like Spin give people the option to rent bikes from a central location. These alternatives make it easier for people to get around without having to own a car.

The technology for self-driving cars is also improving rapidly. This is particularly true in developed countries like the United States, where there are a lot of drivers who are used to having control over their vehicles. As self-driving cars become more widespread, this will change, and drivers will be less likely to be able to rely on their cars to do everything for them.

Overall, I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This is because people are becoming more environmentally conscious, there are more efficient and affordable alternatives to cars, and the technology for self-driving cars is improving rapidly.",1
"One of the most inspiring aspects of travel is experiencing different cultures. While there are certain aspects that are shared across many countries, each location has its own unique culture that can provide invaluable insights into other ways of life. From the language to the cuisine and lifestyle, diving deep into a new culture opens our eyes to different perspectives on life and how to approach it. My most recent trip abroad was to Japan, a country rich in cultural heritage and traditions which provided me with an unforgettable experience filled with adventure, learning and growth. One of my favorite parts about Japan was their traditional tea ceremony known as chanoyu or sado. This ritual involves preparing matcha (green tea) while taking part in activities such as zen meditation or calligraphy. It’s considered a way for people to reflect on their inner peace while also connecting with nature through the appreciation of green tea leaves hand-picked from mountain areas around Japan. I found this ceremony particularly fascinating since it requires both physical practice and mental discipline; something I had never experienced before in my travels!. The Japanese culture also taught me more about the importance of hospitality towards strangers which is deeply rooted within Japanese society. On several occasions during my stay, locals opened up their homes to host visitors like myself who were travelling throughout Japan's rural areas - offering us delicious meals as well as warm conversations about local customs or even anecdotes about historical figures from centuries ago! The sense of community among these rural villages left an indelible impression on me because it showed me just how small acts kindness could bring people together regardless of language barriers or differences between nations/cultures etc. Overall I feel immensely grateful for having been able to be exposed so closely with another culture during my travels – one that challenged all my preconceptions regarding cultural norms & values by providing insight into another world entirely foreign yet still full love & compassion for others despite their vast differences in beliefs/practices etc. Hopefully this newfound knowledge will",1
"Some people believe that the electoral college should be abolished and some people believe that the electoral college has helped us throughout the years. But I believe that electoral college should be abolished.

The reason I believe that the electoral college should be abolished is because I don't believe it is benefiting any elections at all. And a lot of people do not believe in it either. In source two Bradford Plumer said what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce been trying to do, abolish electoral voting. I think that the electoral college makes the president elections to close to tie, and that could be a catastrophe. However source three has made some pretty good points on the electoral college. Saying that  if there was no electoral college there would be no winnertakeall system. this would a terrible problem for the candidates and the voters, and would ruin the whole election.

Therefore sources two and three makes some pretty valuable and good points, but I still think source two makes more sense to me. In source three Richard A. Posner wrote  it is the electors who elect the president not the voters. When your voting for a president candidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. I dont agree that electors decide what we voted for, because then whats the point of voting for a candidate if your not even choosing at all. America is a democracy and having someone choose your president for you is not showing that we live in a democratic nation. We need to choose so we can learn from our own mistakes and then we won't make them again.

This just shows that the House Of representatives and the government don't trust us at all and that we cant make good decisions. Source one doesnt say anything about being against or with it but it did point out some interesting facts about the electoral college. The office of the federal register wrote  the electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. What their saying is that we might not have huge say on the election but we do have a pretty big say on it. I don't that we have any say on it what so ever, and that is because of the slate of electors.

In conclusion, I agree with what source two had to say because of the great points they made and the facts that led me to belive that the electoral college does not work at all. Read the sources and then tell me if you think i'm right or wrong.",0
"Do you think students should have career durimg school at a yong age? Their's some families have poor economy. They dont have that much money to keep their child dreams. Student should work during school at a young age because students need save money for college payment, this help students to acuaintance with work environment, they will have their own credit cart.

Firsly,Student should work during school at a young age because students need save money for college payment. All the students have dream to studey in a collage and become someone in future. some families have poor economy, they can't pay for collage of their child and they are earnings that much to eat and make a living like pay insurence and simething like that. For example my friend Generic_Name she is 11 grade. she is working in patrakandy mall as a cushier, so she doce't have father and just her mother, her letter brother is with her. she is working and saving the money for her collage.

Secondly, this help students to acuaintance with work environment. The more students working the more they are getting smarter and understand about the job. Students will become a enterpreneur in future, and get familier with different people in community. For example to know more poeple and be familier with different job this make easy, successful life work for their future.

Lastly, they will have their own credit cart. This is good for student to have his/her own cridet card and to take responsibilty for paying their car insurence and other stuff. some childs have pride and can't ask for money of their parents. For example some student have a big maind that means their brain is older then their age and they will have their own responsibilty not asking for help , they will work hard and become stranger.

Some people thing this is not a good idea for students to work. They are too young and they have to study and they are still high school, have a lot of homework to do,this is right they are too young for working, but still some students need to work because they need to pay for their collage. for some people who have a lot of money it it is nothing to pay for something like collage of their child ,or other stuff like this, but for the families who is earning just for eating, make living and have poor economy this is really hard so we shold realize those people too.

In conclution

Student should work during school at a young age because students need save money for college payment, this help students to acuaintance with work environment, they will have their own credit cart. Student should have responsibilty, they shold see the hardness meanness of life to grow up.",0
"There are pros and cons to both paper and electronic cards, but overall, I believe that electronic cards are the better choice.

One of the main advantages of electronic cards is that they are more environmentally friendly. They do not require any paper, ink, or postage, which means that they produce less waste. In addition, many electronic cards are recyclable, so they can be used over and over again.

Another advantage of electronic cards is that they are more convenient. You can send them to people anywhere in the world with just a few clicks of a mouse. And since most people now have smartphones, they can also be viewed on the go.

Finally, electronic cards are often more affordable than paper cards. You can usually find a wide variety of electronic cards for free, while paper cards can be quite expensive.

Despite these advantages, some people still prefer paper cards. They argue that electronic cards are not as personal as paper cards, and that they do not display the same function.

I disagree with this argument. First of all, electronic cards can be just as personal as paper cards, if not more so. You can add your own personal message, and you can choose from a variety of designs and fonts.

Second, electronic cards can be just as functional as paper cards. They can be used for birthday cards, thank you cards, and holiday cards, just to name a few.

In conclusion, I believe that electronic cards are the better choice for holiday greetings. They are more environmentally friendly, more convenient, and more affordable.",1
"Dear Senator [Name],

I am writing to share my concerns regarding the current method of electing our nation's president: the Electoral College. While the system holds historical value, echoing the time of the founding fathers, it also has severe repercussions. Therefore, I'm advocating a shift towards a direct popular vote system, a change necessary for preserving the democratic principles America prides itself on.

The Electoral College system, as defined by the Office of the Federal Register, establishes a process where we, the citizens, are actually voting for electors who subsequently cast their votes for the presidential candidates. The system carries undeniable flaws, counter to offering a fair representation of the populace's preference.

Bradford Plumer, in The Indefensible Electoral College, highlights these issues in detail. He exposes the 'disaster factor', the potential for electors to defy their obligation towards citizens and manipulate the electoral process. Historical evidence supports this argument, with attempts to override popular vote dating back to 1960. Furthermore, under the current system, the overall will of the nation sometimes remains unaddressed, as exemplified when a president-elect receives fewer popular votes than their competitor – as occurred in the 2000 election when Al Gore lost to George Bush.

In addition, the winner-take-all rule, in battleground states, results in undue influence for a minority of citizens and discourages candidates from campaigning in states that they perceive as secure or unattainable. This creates a political landscape where many American votes play little part in the eventual election outcome.

However, those advocating for the retention of the Electoral College, Judge Richard A. Posner among them, argue that it provides certainty of outcome, ensures a candidate with trans-regional appeal, focuses attention on swing states with thoughtful voters, lends weight to larger states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While Posner's arguments carry weight, it is pertinent to ask ourselves if preserving a system that can discount the will of the majority for these benefits aligns with our core democratic values.

The Electoral College compromises the innate fairness and equality embedded in each vote. Democracy, in its purest sense, calls for an election system where every vote holds equal value, regardless of demographic or geographic factors. This fundamental democratic principle aligns more harmoniously with a direct popular vote system, where our citizens' collective voice can resonate unabridged.

I urge you, Senator [Name], to consider this plea from a concerned citizen. Promote a renewed conversation about our electoral system, questioning whether the Electoral College is the most suitable system for the 21st century. Emphasize the value of each vote, the crux of democracy, and America's timeless dedication to equality and representation.

Thank you for your time and service to our state.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of these advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased access to alternative transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the impact it has on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. This is particularly important as efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions become more urgent on a global scale.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog illustrates the detrimental effects of car emissions on the environment. The ban resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and smog levels. By limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, cities can not only improve air quality but also create healthier and more sustainable environments for their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the increased accessibility to alternative transportation options. The passage about Vauban, Germany, showcases a community that has embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this community, residents have access to a tram system and convenient walking and biking infrastructure. By designing communities in a way that prioritizes public transportation and pedestrian-friendly spaces, it becomes easier for residents to rely less on cars and utilize other forms of transportation. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a more active and healthier lifestyle.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights the success of a car-free day initiative in reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can save on infrastructure costs associated with building and maintaining roads and parking facilities. Additionally, car-free initiatives can boost local economies by promoting the use of public transit, walking, and biking, which in turn supports local businesses and reduces the reliance on car-centric industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, increase access to alternative transportation options, and have economic benefits. As the passages demonstrate, this approach is being embraced in various parts of the world and can contribute to creating healthier, more sustainable, and livable communities. By prioritizing alternative transportation and designing communities with less emphasis on car dependency, individuals and society can reap the benefits of limiting car usage.",1
"In the picture that you were showen looks like a face on Mars that many people believe was created by Aliens, Scientist call the face Face of Mars. Face of Mars has been a pop icon, it has starred in many films, books, radio shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for over 25 years!

Many people believe this face has been created by aliens because of how far it it and how barley visible it is, would this prove that there is Human life on Mars? many people believe that their is human life on mars but some people are skeptics. I truly believe that this is just a natural landform. Some believe, like scientists figure it was rock forming and had unusual shadows that made it look like an illusion with a human head, eyes, nose, and a mouth. Authors have reasoned it is a good way to get attention to mars, which has worked. There are three different photos from seperate years that show a face but you can clearly see the face has slowly dissapeared by 1998, by 2001 the face looks like it has faded slowly. Nasa scientists were starting to dissagree at some point but that is okay, people have there own way of beliveing stuff. Most scientists on Nasa believe it has been natural rock formation over the years, they seem to be pretty positive. most scientists like to keep information to their selves instead of saying infromation to conspiracy theorists which can give false information.

Natural Landforms are common around the American West, it makes more sense to prove that it is just natural rock landform coming together forming rock and the shadow illusion of a face, as scientists predict. As many more years come around there might be more information about the Face of Mars.",0
"Today in society cell phones play a huge part in deaths because people use their cell phones while driving because they want to text, call, take pictures, and or even being on social media. As people continue to depend on cellphones for their communication needs these devices not only become more useful but also more dangerous, especially when people are using their phones at the wrong times. The most dangerous time to use your phone is when you are driving. If you use your phone while you are driving, you are taking a huge risk on losing your life or taking someone else's life. The action of many countries around the world to ban the use of cell phones while driving may have served to deter drivers from using their phones as they drive.

One of the main reasons that make using cell phones while driving very dangerous is that using the cell phone reduces a driver's reaction time in traffic. On busy roads, the amount of time that one talks before reacting to a situation in most cases determines whether someone gets to continue living. It is very dangerous to text and call while driving but texting while driving is more dangerous because the driver must constantly keep looking at the phone screen in order to type or read the messages. Studies show that people who text while driving tend to accelerate more slowly after stepping on the brakes, this can cause irregularities for another driver leading to possible accidents and since their eyes are more on the text than the road, drivers who choose to text while driving have a much higher chance of hitting a pedestrian than those not distracted in driving.

Many accidents, whether severe or not, usually occur within a blink of an eye. This means that just a moment of distraction is enough for a driver to cause a serious road accident. Given the many concerns, it is best if drivers were not only banned from texting but banned from their phones in any way at all as they drive.",0

Dear State senator,

The Electoral College is a system where electors vote for the people off of the states votes . Where some eletors may stera from the beeten paath , but there is no reason to change the system now.

it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. when you vote for a presidential candidate ypu're actually voting for s slate of electors..

. Meaning a group of people in each state vote for the the presidnt . This is importent to know because it lets peopple know that their vote narow down the choeses . Although the electoral college system givesthe eletion an electon a winer takes all  feel .

Some people may believe that their vote doesnt matter  because of the electoral college system, but as 

What Is the Electoral Collge?

( bay the Office of Federal Register) points out that 

Most states have a winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate .. Which says that in some states the electors vote for whom-ever the majoratiy of the state voted for. That is suggnifucnt because it shows that the peoples vote do matter.

On the other hand the elector college system is not perfict. Eventhough most states have winner-take-all system, there may be a

"The issue of whether a family should tell a cancer patient the truth has been a contentious one in recent years, particularly in the Chinese culture. On the one hand, some people argue that this traditional practice should be changed along with the development of modernization. On the other hand, some people argue that it'should remain the same. In this essay, I will argue that this traditional practice should be changed and that families should tell cancer patients the truth.

First of all, it is important to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they receive the best possible treatment. Without knowing the truth, cancer patients may not be able to make informed decisions about their treatment, which could lead to poorer outcomes and a worse prognosis. For example, if a family does not tell a cancer patient the truth and instead tells them that the cancer is not serious, the patient may not seek out the best possible treatment and the cancer may ultimately become more serious. This could have serious implications for the patient’s health and wellbeing.

Secondly, it is important to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they have the emotional support they need to deal with their diagnosis. Without knowing the truth, cancer patients may not be able to process their emotions and may not be able to access the support they need. For example, if a family does not tell a cancer patient the truth and instead tells them that the cancer is not serious, the patient may not be able to access the emotional support they need to cope with the diagnosis and may become overwhelmed by the situation.

Finally, it is important to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they have the best possible quality of life. Without knowing the truth, cancer patients may not be able to make informed decisions about their care and may not be able to access the support they need to ensure the best possible quality of life. For example, if a family does not tell a cancer patient the truth and instead tells them that the cancer is not serious, the patient may not be able to access the support they need to ensure the best possible quality of life.

In conclusion, it is important for families to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they receive the best possible treatment, have the emotional support they need to cope with their diagnosis, and have the best possible quality of life. In the Chinese culture, this traditional practice should be changed to ensure that cancer patients are able to make informed decisions about their care and access the support they need.",1
"I don't agree with using this technology to read students emotional expression. I think it wouldnt be a machines business to know how your feeling because some people like muself sometimes dont want to know how you really feel. For example. if I was feeling down one day about my dog passing away, and my little sisters want me to take them to the park. Im gonna stay as positive and happy as possible so it doesnt ruin their day. I would take them to the park making it seem like im happy, then eventually be happy myself after the fun we have. I wouldnt want some machine telling me or other people my emotions because thats my business.

Our emotions belong to us only and we choose for people or other things to know how we feel when we want to.

I am not the only one who sometimes hides the way they feel for a bit. We all know if you try to stay positive and have a good day that you will get over no matter what the situation is bringing you down. If you stay positive and happy, then it will all go away eventually instead of expressing how you feel and staying depressed or crying all day.

It seems like this technology can be useful or pretty cool to use on histroical people. Like who wouldnt want to know how Abe Lincon felt when he took his picture to be on the dollar bill. That would interest me by alot. Only because that is history and its very intersting, but using it everyday of your life can be really annoying and show less privacy. It is a good way to cheer people up like if a friend was feeling down and didnt want to tell you how he or she felt at the moment. That is understandable, but like i explained all you have to do is asume that they are feeling down and cheer them up the best you can and carry on with the day. Eventually they will be back to they're old self again.

Knowing how someone feels right off the top can be annoying for some people like myself. It can cause others like myself to feel very uncomfortable and not wanting to express how they feel because some machine does it for you. Maybe some people want to express how he or she felt a few days after they felt down or depressed. I highly disagree with thus technology being used in our everyday lives to see how we feel, although it would be very nice and interesting to use this technolgy on histroical pictures like the famous Mona Lisa or how President Abe Lincon felt on the dollar bill photo.",0
"Should people be able to drive a vehicle and use a cell phone yes or no ?

Today in Atlanta a lot of car accidents happen due to people being on their phones instead of driving. So therefore I say no people should not be able to use their phones while operating an vehicle. One little text is not worth your life or someone else's life !

I think that an law should be passed so that people won't use they phone and if caught using their phones they get a ticket. Of course people don't want to have to pay a fine so they would obey the law. Making this law would keep a lot of car accidents from happening here in atlanta. When on the expressway down here all you see is people on their phone making videos and then boom they hit another car all because they wasn't paying attention to the road.

Another reason I say that you should've be able to use cell phones and drive is because you need both hands to keep control over the wheel. Turning with one hand is hard to do. I actually witness someone have a phone in one and driving with the other one swerve off the road because she couldn't properly control the wheel with one hand. Which had me thinking is being on a phone while driving really worth your life or someone else or even just having to pay extra money to get your car or someone's else fixed all because of a mistake that could've been prevented !

With that being stated please help us get a law to keep people off their phones ! I wouldn't want anything to happen to no one family or mines all because of someone wanting to send a text or make a nice video driving ! It is not worth going to jail for killing or hurting someone or being sued ! Please keep in mind when driving your not just driving for your self your driving for everyone .When you make a wrong it effects everyone. If you swerve other cars would start to swerve because there trying not to get hit. So just wait to send the text or simply call them through the car Bluetooth!",0
"Dear Senate, It's official, The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's really hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a nondemocratic method of selectiong a president that will be by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. According the the In Defense of the Electoral College article, the electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense.....it is the electors who elect the president not the people. So basically we are voting for the electors and we keep our finger crossed that they vote for the president we want. It is unpractical that the people vote for the president they would like to govern their counrty and then the opposite party wins. According to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly ater Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College, won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. The last election was yet another close one thanks to the Electoral College, which the popular vote winner lost the presidency. After all of this the Electoral College still has its defenders...

At the most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winnertakeall system in each state. Candidates that don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.Source 2 The Elector Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. But other types of voters just like the play around according to article two.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapporionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution but is this system really the most logical one to use?Source 3. True this system has worked for many years but it is time for a change. People are starting to think it is unfair and really poinless to even vote when the president they want will possibly not win anyway.

The single best argument against the Electoral College is what we might call the disaster factor. Source 1 The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Source 2 Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that popular vote would not have gone to Kennedy. Source 3 In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. There are some reasons for retaining the Electoral College but it still lacks democratic pedigree. And the people should have the right to vote on the president they think is the best for country. After all its,We the people not, We the electors.",0
"Have you ever been pondering over a question? Ever wonder which path you should take to get somewhere? Needed advice from a friend,or family member on an important topic? If so, who have you gone to?

everybody has a different opinion on a subject. Some think that you should write your paper. Others will say you should type, and print it. So, what this is saying is that, people can give different advice. When you dont know what to do, you can usually look for advice on the matter. You first might go to a parent/guardian. They can give you an answer to your'e problem,but you still feel its best to seek other solutions. Next, you could go to a friend. They could possibly give you a different answer to your'e problem. Asking multiply people for advice can be a good thing. Everybody has the privilege to their opinion. In spite of that, people have different beliefs,style,taste in music,etc.

As so,its always important to ask others on what they think of the matter. Sometimes,their opinion can become a conflict. Say if you talk about a religion. It wouldnt be the best idea to ask a catholic question to atheists. They could get offended by it or even take it to court. It is good to ask others,but make sure the question is appropriate. Be careful on who you ask. They might give you horrible advice. If you take that advice it could lead to consequences. You should never get advice from someone with a criminal record. As seen from them already, they made terrible life choices and thats how they ended up in a drastic measure. They gave advice to themselves and thats how they ended up in prison,jail,etc. So please, if you are needed of advice, go to a trusted figure.

Now, think of how badly you need this piece of advice. Is it a result of school,business/job, friendship,or family relationship? If not one of these options then finding a solution should not be a problem. Think of when you ask multiple citizens for advice. Did anyone have the same opinion with the last person you ask. If more,and more people give you the same advice, you should most likely take it to heart. You can tell if the advice was a help, you should go to those people when you are in a dire situation. They are most likely a wise person that has experienced what you are going through now. Whether its a teacher, parent,friend. If they give you the advice you needed all along of what you needed then they are the 'go to' person. Those people you asked advice for can help you make the best choice to your'e leading path.

You can never just rely on one single person. If you only ask a single person. all you get is their opinions. Say if they tell you to do something, but you know its wrong. You would still mostly dedicate the problem into their advice, even if their wrong. Now you are the one that is leading a bad life. It is very important to ask others, but also give an opinion to yourself. Think to yourself, Im I making a mistake? You could potentially make the worst decision of your'e life, and will give you deep regrets. You need to rely on yourself sometimes, because someday there wont be anybody to give you advice for your'e problems. You will have to take what you have learned over the years from others, and put that to your'e knowledge.

If you cant sort of an explanation, maybe you should take it to the public. You could post something on the internet and look for the peoples comments. Maybe go to a near by park and set up an 'Advice stand.' Do something to get others attention. With hundreds, and thousands of people near you, you definitely will get the advice you need. Be warned in advance though. People can be very critical so make sure your'e problem is something that wont be taken to the authority.

If that is everything you can follow the steps needed for advice. First, give yourself advice. Next ask a trusted adult or friend. Then find the best solution. Finally put that advice to action. With that you should never have to worry about making the wrong decision ever again.",0
"First impressions can be a powerful force in shaping the way teenagers in high school think of themselves. A single comment or facial expression made by someone they want to impress can have a significant impact on their self-confidence and self-worth. This can lead to insecurities, feelings of inadequacy, and distaste for their own strengths and abilities. It can also cause teenagers to miss out on opportunities that could have otherwise proved beneficial. If a student has already made a poor first impression, they may not even bother to apply for a job or school program because they are convinced that no one would give them a chance. This can create a cycle of doubt and negativity, in which teenagers are unable to escape from their self-imposed mental prison.",1
"Many argue that longer summer vacations would be beneficial to children and teenagers, as it would provide them with more time to relax and enjoy themselves. This would be especially useful during times of high stress, such as final exams, when students need to find ways to de-stress from their rigorous studies. Additionally, a longer summer vacation could provide more opportunity for learning through activities such as volunteer work, internships, or travel experiences that might not be available during the school year. 

However, opponents of longer summer vacations suggest that additional days away from school could lead to a decline in academic performance. As students would be away from their learning environment for a prolonged period, it could be difficult for them to stay on track with their studies and apply new skills in a timely fashion. Additionally, such a decrease in structure and routine could be damaging to children’s development, and intense summer courses may be the only solution to catch up after a longer absence from the classroom. 

Ultimately, whether a longer or shorter summer vacation is preferable depends on a variety of factors. At the end of the day, students need to find a balance between taking a break to rest and restoring their motivation for learning.",1
"Space exploration has been a staple of science fiction for centuries, and with the development of technology, space travel is becoming more and more plausible. But what are the benefits that humanity could gain from exploring space? To answer this question it's important to look at examples of successful missions in recent years. One example would be NASA's Mars rover Curiosity mission in 2012. The rover was able to send back valuable data about the planet's environment, climate, and atmosphere which allowed us to understand the red planet better than ever before. This data also gave scientists insights into future potential colonisation of Mars as well as providing evidence that there was once water on its surface - a key indicator for life existing elsewhere in our solar system. Another benefit gained through space exploration is through satellite technology which helps support communications around the world such as broadband internet access or GPS navigation systems. Satellites placed in orbit provide real-time information about weather patterns allowing countries to make informed decisions related to public safety concerns like hurricanes or flooding events from severe storms – something essential for saving lives during natural disasters. In addition, satellites can detect changes in sea levels due to global warming with great accuracy so governments can plan environmental policies accordingly, helping protect wildlife habitats and preserving fragile ecosystems throughout our planet for generations to come. . Finally, we must consider how much understanding of ourselves we will receive by exploring further into outer space: searching for signs of other intelligent life forms while investigating new planets not only gives us hope but may uncover answers pertaining to questions humans have asked since the dawn of time - where did we come from? What else exists beyond our own solar system? Could this knowledge help bring peace between warring nations here on Earth? These are difficult questions but they raise awareness among people everywhere regarding our responsibility towards protecting our home planet while also expanding human horizons past what we currently know thus far about existence outside Earth’s atmosphere. .

"The importance of preserving historical sites cannot be overstated. Not only are these places important for their own sake, but they preserve the history and culture of a region for future generations to enjoy. Whether it is a castle in Scotland, an old mining town in Colorado, or an ancient temple in India, these cherished monuments can teach us invaluable lessons about the past. Preserving these sites helps to keep alive our collective human heritage and allows us to better understand how different societies have evolved over time. Historical sites also provide tangible evidence of humanity’s accomplishments throughout the ages. Examining artifacts from centuries ago gives us insights into our ancestors' lives – what they ate, how they worked and played, religion and spiritual practices – that we could otherwise never gain access to through books alone. Moreover, historical sites can bring communities together by providing common ground on which people of all backgrounds may learn more about each other's cultures and histories while gaining appreciation for one another’s differences. They may even become tourist attractions, bringing much-needed economic activity to local economies while allowing visitors from around the world to experience something unique that contributes further knowledge regarding global history as a whole. Furthermore, these locations add beauty and charm wherever they are situated; tourists often flock to view spectacular remains such as castles or cathedrals because such structures evoke feelings of awe within them when viewed firsthand. In short, preserving generational landmarks is essential not only because it preserves valuable aspects of society’s past but also brings income into impoverished areas as well as create shared experiences amongst diverse individuals who come together with mutual respect for one another's cultural heritage . Therefore investing resources towards protecting historic buildings should be seen not just as an act concerning preservation efforts but also opportunity investment worthy endeavors that benefit many facets within modern day society",1

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in electing the President of the United States. While many argue for a shift towards a popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College provides essential benefits to our democracy that should not be overlooked.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As outlined by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the election outcome and ensures a clear and decisive victor. While there have been instances of electoral disputes, they are far less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 presidential election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the representation of all regions and prevents a candidate from having purely regional appeal. Each region of our country has a significant number of electoral votes, and no single region has enough to elect a president. This encourages candidates to campaign and address the concerns of voters across different regions, preventing them from focusing solely on populous areas or regions where they have overwhelming support. In turn, this creates a president who genuinely represents the interests of all Americans, regardless of their regional location.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes leads to effective campaign strategies and fosters meaningful engagement with voters. As Judge Posner points out, the focus on swing states ensures that candidates invest time and effort in convincing voters in those states. This compels voters in swing states to pay close attention to the candidates' policies and proposals, ultimately resulting in a more educated and thoughtful electorate. By concentrating campaign efforts on these states, candidates address the concerns of a diverse range of voters and create policies that align with their needs and aspirations.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power held by large states. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, smaller states are given equal weighting when it comes to electing the president. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated regions and ensures that the concerns and interests of citizens in smaller states are given due consideration. It creates a more equitable representation of all Americans and prevents a small number of densely populated states from overwhelming the voice of citizens in less populous areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College system avoids the complications that could arise from run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College always produces a clear winner. This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections, allowing for a smooth and efficient election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College system may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely driven by the belief that a single vote may decide an election. In the 2012 election, approximately half of eligible Americans cast their votes, indicating a desire to express their political preference regardless of the outcome. Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that all states receive attention during the campaign, as candidates understand the impact of winning electoral votes from various regions.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system plays a vital role in our democracy, guaranteeing a certain outcome, ensuring representation from all regions, promoting focused campaigning, balancing political power among states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. The Electoral College is not a perfect system, but it offers crucial benefits that should not be disregarded. I urge you to consider these advantages when evaluating any proposals to change the current method of electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Title: The Benefits of Reduced Car Usage: A Shift toward a Sustainable and Healthier Lifestyle

With the rapid increase in car usage, the adverse impacts on the environment have become apparent, affecting human health, quality of life, and the climate. Conversely, communities that have begun to limit car usage, such as Vauban in Germany and Bogota in Colombia, present a picture of healthier living, less pollution, and overall improvement in quality of life.

In Vauban, suburban life has been separated from auto use, an experiment initiated in 2006 (Rosenthal par. 4). Residents have responded by choosing to give up their cars as car-free streets promotes less stressful and healthier lifestyles, enhancing both physical and mental wellbeing (Rosenthal par. 3). Conversely, car-intensive areas such as suburbs experience higher greenhouse gas emissions, contributing significantly to environmental pollution (Rosenthal par. 5).

In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced due to near-record pollution levels, with the result being a 60 percent reduction in congestion (Duffer pars. 10, 14). This scenario illustrates the swift changes that can result from reducing car usage, including immediate improvements in air quality. Similarly, Bogota's car-free day initiative produced streets devoid of traffic jams, demonstrating the potential for cities to manage congestion and improve residents' quality of life (Selsky par. 20).

Going beyond environmental impacts, a shift towards reducing car usage also benefits social development. Vauban, for instance, has adapted its urban planning by placing stores within walking distance, rather than in distant malls, hence promoting physical activity and community interaction (Rosenthal par. 6). Similarly, Bogota's car-free day not only reduced smog but also promoted alternative transportation modes that encourage physical exercise and reduce stress (Selsky par. 21, 27).

Interestingly, newer generations have been observed to be less car-dependent. Recent studies suggest that an increasing number of young people are opting for public transit or non-motorized transportation methods, attributed to various factors including telecommuting options, urban living, and changes in commuting attitudes (Rosenthal pars. 29, 32-35). This emerging trend suggests a long-term shift away from car culture, which could hold profound implications for the environment and society.

Lastly, car-manufacturing companies are not blind to this shift. Some are already rebranding themselves as mobility companies, adapting to a changing landscape where personal vehicle ownership is less and less desirable (Rosenthal par. 34). Herein lies the potential for innovative business opportunities such as partnering with telecommunications industry to create interconnected transportation networks that save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety (Rosenthal par. 43).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers environmental, health, and societal benefits, as shown by communities like Vauban and Bogota, as well as the shifting attitudes of the younger generations. In response to these changes, industries can adapt and innovate to ensure they remain relevant, facilitating towards a more sustainable and healthier future, less dependent on cars.",1
"It is often said that home is where the heart is, and this statement certainly holds true for people who are lucky enough to live in coastal towns. Coastal towns have earned a special place in the hearts of many due to their unique atmosphere and culture that fosters strong community bonds. This particular essay will delve into some of the reasons why life in a coastal town has become so beloved by its inhabitants. The first reason why living in a coastal town can be so magical is because these areas usually provide unparalleled access to nature. Residents of such places have an almost direct connection with nature since they are surrounded by oceans, rivers, forests, and other natural wonders on all sides. No matter what time of day or night it may be, one can always find solace simply by taking a walk around town and enjoying the beauty of the landscape as well as any wildlife that may inhabit it. In addition, most people enjoy being closer to seafood-related activities like fishing or crabbing - something which wouldn't normally be available if living further inland!. . Another great thing about living near water is how peaceful it can be! Due to its proximity to calming bodies of water like oceans or lakes, life in a coastal town offers respite from busy city noise both through sound waves and air quality alone. The vastness of seas creates space between neighbors while also providing plenty room for personal exploration - whether through swimming or boat rides along coastlines! Additionally, certain beachfront areas boast beautiful sunsets every evening - creating stunning visuals that never fail to leave good impressions with those witnessing them firsthand!. . Finally, residents living close together near coasts tend to build extremely strong relationships within their communities; this sense of tight-knit camaraderie among locals helps foster healthier lifestyles as well as stronger emotional connections between citizens themselves (especially when dealing with difficult times). People here tend not only appreciate but also rely on each other more than anywhere else: neighbors helping neighbors out during storms; parents pitching",1
"The automobile is one of mankind greatest innovations. Since its invention in the 20th century, it has made tasks such as commuting to work or visiting your friends simpler than ever. Just hop in your car and your gaspowered vehicle will have you there within minutes. Although they are handy, could too much of a good thing be a bad thing? In this case, I believe that this is true. Limiting car usage could have benefits such as easier and cheaper transportation and fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

Imagine a world where public transportation subways, trains, buses could be accessed easier. Now look past the ways of modern life and cars we've become so dependent on. The growth of public transportation in places other than large cities could have huge benefits to the communities. Cars would not be relied upon and not as much money would have to be spent on gas. Of course people would still use cars to get from point A to point B but they would see public transportation as more of a goto option. Source 4 Bill Ford proposed a plan of partering with telecommunications industries to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycles, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety. I believe limiting car usage would therefore raise public transportation usage and allow us to commute safer and cheaper than before.

Pollution has become an increasingly important problem in recent years. With all the craze over whether global warming is imminent or not, many have been trying to find ways to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. The United States holds claim to the invention of the automobile and also stands as one of the most car reliant countries averaging at least one per household. According to the text, passenger cars are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in some carintensive areas in the United States Source 1. Reducing that number by ways of carpooling, public transport, and hybrid cars, would benefit our society and help to protect the world we live in for future generations. For example, Source 2after days of intensifying smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city one Monday. Motorists with evennumbered plates were told to leave their cars at home or face a 31 fine. In just one day, car traffic was down 60 percent with less people driving and the smog cleared enough to lift the ban for oddnumbered plates the next day. In Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar, Colombia a similar experiment was put to test where there was a full Day Without cars. This plan promoted alternative transportation bicycles, walking, taxis, buses and helped to reduce smog. A local businessman from Bogota saw the day as beneficial and states that It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Source 3 Although modern lifestyles have become overly dependent on cars, usage can be reduced and have many benefits to our society. While this would be a process that would no doubt take years to accomplish globally, I believe that it is very possible and likely that limiting car usage would lead to easier and cheaper transportation, and fewer greenhouse gas emissions or pollution.",0
"As of right now, imagining an automobile-free world may sound crazy, but amibitous goals to end the use of cars has taken place. Suburban and city residents have taken quite a lot of thought into banning driving and giving up their cars, because of the great advantages that go along with these limitations. Reducing the use of cars has amazing advantages in creating a non-polluted environment, it leads to an increase in exercise, and provides a way to save one's money.

Car reduced communities are being promoted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, aswell as all around the world. Paris, France has enforced a driving ban to reduce the intensifying pollution all over the city, as explained in the article entitled, Paris bans driving due to smog. If the pattern of banning the use of cars persists, the amount of pollution will be reduced, especially in major big cities, such as Paris, London and Beijing. Continuing this cultural shift will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment (The End of Car Culture). Limiting the use of cars would highly advantage and could possibly save our environment, if we conserve our resources correctly.

Hiking, biking, skating and/or walking are all types of physical activities that are useful to get from point A to B, rather than using a car. People have began to organize their lives around how they can get to places by exercising, than commuting by car. Restaurants, shopping malls, and work offices are beginning to be located in highly populated areas and within walking range, so that the use of automobiles becomes unecessary. In Bogota, Columbia, people take a car-free day to promote alternative forms of transporation and reduce smog. Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths (Car-free day is spnning into a big hit in Bogota), in order to encourage citizens to get off the roads with their cars. Exercising has many advantages in limiting car usage, not only creating a non-polluted planet, but also creating a healthier lifestlye for a person.

As gasoline prices rise, and car insurance rates fly up, less and less people are getting a license and have stopped buying cars to save money. A study done between the years 2001 and 2009 found that driving by young people decreased by twenty-three percent, explained in the article, The End of Car Culture. Leasing or owning a car is not a priority for many, as the use of taking public transportation or car-pooling is available. Without cars, people are able to save money for important life necessecities, such as food, water, and shelter, where as a car is not something needed and may be considered a luxury in other parts of the world.

Commuting is not imposibble without owning a car. With forms of exercise and public transportation, many are able to get around without spending hundreds of dollars per week on gasoline. Less driving creates a non-polluted and healthier environment, keeping our planet more stable. Eventhough owning a car seems convenient now, it may not be so convenient in the long run, as we may have to face difficulties that life throws at us. Wasting money on a car gives no advantages, where as a car-free environment is safer and more effective.",0
"In recent years, as electronic media has become increasingly prevalent, there has been a debate over the best way to send holiday greetings. Some people believe that electronic cards are more environmentally friendly than paper cards, while others argue that paper cards have a more personal touch. I believe that each type of card has it's own advantages and disadvantages, and that the best way to send holiday greetings depends on the situation.

Paper cards have a number of advantages. First, they are more personal than electronic cards. When you receive a paper card in the mail, you can see the care that the sender took in choosing it, addressing it, and writing a personal message. It is a physical reminder of the sender's thoughtfulness. Electronic cards, on the other hand, can feel impersonal and even cold. Second, paper cards are more likely to be saved and displayed. Many people keep paper cards as mementos, or hang them on their refrigerator or bulletin board. They become part of the decoration for the season. Electronic cards, on the other hand, are often deleted after they are read. Finally, paper cards support the tradition of sending holiday greetings. For many people, sending and receiving paper Christmas cards is an important part of the holiday season.

There are also advantages to sending electronic cards. First, they are more environmentally friendly than paper cards. Paper cards require the use of trees for paper, and energy for transportation and production. They also generate a lot of waste, since most people throw them away after reading them. Electronic cards have a much smaller environmental impact. Second, electronic cards are more convenient. They can be sent quickly and easily, and you don't have to worry about them getting lost in the mail. Finally, electronic cards can be more personal than paper cards, if they are used thoughtfully. A well-chosen electronic card can be as personal as a paper card, and can even include a photo or video message.

In conclusion, there are pros and cons to both paper and electronic cards. The best way to send holiday greetings depends on the situation. If you want to send a card that is environmentally friendly and convenient, an electronic card is a good choice. If you want to send a card that is more personal and traditional, a paper card is a better choice.",1
"Individual character is shaped by a variety of forces beyond one's control, and this idea is reflected in the quote by John Lubbock, It is not what we have, but what we use, that makes us rich. This notion applies to both material and immaterial wealth; while some may be born with an abundance of natural resources, it is only those who know how to properly use and appreciate all that they possess that can truly benefit from their possessions. Character is formed by the physical contexts in which a person is raised, as well as the values, morals, and beliefs that are instilled in them from society. The quote emphasizes that this underlying wealth or capital must be recognized and put to use in order to see the greatest value. In other words, we must be purposeful in our approach to whatever resources we may have. Through understanding and realizing the potential of our possessions, we can be more successful in life.",1
"The Electoral college is a process where electors vote for President and Vice President, and count the number of electoral votes by Congress. Many people are debating whether or not keep the Electoral collegee or change it to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Although the Electoral collegee has been taking place for many years now, it can be a disaster factor. I believe that the Electoral collegee should be abolished and changed to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it will make the election fair, the chance of there being a tie is much less, and it will be rather rational as oposed to the Electoral collegee.

The Electoral collegee is not fair and it is irrational. Voters don't vote directly to the president they want. According to Source 1: What is the Electoral collegee? voters actually voting for their candidate's electors. Majority of the states have a winner take all system in which electors are awarded to the winning candidate. Voters don't get to chose who exactly they want, it's based upon which elector they chose that really determines who will win the presidential election. The voters can't always control what the elector they chose does with what thy're decision was on who they wanted to win the election, and they just as well get confused and sometimes possibly make the wrong choice. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is fair for anyone who votes. There is less chance of getting confused and less chance of picking the wrong elector. Even though others may argue that each party selects trusted electors to vote for the patry's nominees, it's still not fair to those who get confused and end up picking the wrong elector which leads to wrong vote towards the presidential election.

The chances of it turning out to be a tie aren't low. according to Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong, a tie has happened before. States have sent two states of electors to Congress. Although it happened long ago, it doesn't mean that it won't occur anytime again. Abolishing the Electoral collegee can give a less chance for that to occur. Since staes have the winner take all system, the candidates don't even spend time or focus on the states that the know they have no chance in winning in. According to source 2, there were seventeen states who didn't even get to see the election at all, and some votes didn't even get to see the ad of the campaign.

The presidential election will become rational to many people. There may be cons to abolishing the Electoral collegee but there are more pros to it rather than cons. It would make the presidential election fair and easier for the voters voting for the candidates. People may argue that it's best to keep the Electoral collegee because some states may not have enough people voting for the candidates so it wouldn't be possible to directly vote for the president of the United States but there are more states who do have the chance to chose and make a direct decision rather than picking an elector who may or may not go agaisnt the party that had picked them and then they can end up chosing who they, the electors want instead of what the voter really wanted and intended. Many people may be able to agree that it is best to abolish the Electoral collegee instead of keeping it. The electors are picked mostly based upon the state.

Abolishing the Electoral collegee is the fair, rational, and beneficial thing to do. Keeping the Electoral collegee won't benefit the presidential election in any way possible. It's better to keep the election fair than otherwise. Voters should be able to know exaclty who they're picking without any confusion or without accidently picking the wrong person. People shouldn't need to be confused about who they're picking and they shouldn't have to posibly worry at the fact that the elector they voted for might defy the will of the voters and they would pick who they, the voters feel like picking rather than picking who the voters vote was actually intended for in the first place. There are risks to basically putting the voters vote in someone elses hands and the voters vote can easily be changed by one of the electors that the party had picked because they trusted that person. If the presidential election was about who you can pick directly, then it would be much easier and the voters will know that the presidential election was fair and nothing was done to change who they voted for in the beginning.",0
"Recent studies have shown that the imposition of curfews can have both positive and negative effects on teenagers and their communities. On the positive side, curfews can lead to improved safety levels, as they restrict the number of hours that teens can be out and potentially engaging in risky activities. Additionally, curfews can lead to improved morale within the community, as they can reduce levels of vandalism and youth delinquency. On the negative side, curfews can be disproportionately enforced, and teens who abide by the rule may unfairly be suspected of criminal activity when out after curfew hours. Furthermore, teens may express feelings of resentment or entrapment when curfews are imposed, which can lead to an erosion of general trust within a community. Ultimately, when considering the impact of curfews on teenagers and their communities, it is important to consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy.",1
"Some people say that aim too high is not for them. This should be because people does not feel ready. Some people would want to aim high, but they do not want to know how would be the outcome. Although, some people think that aim too high is a waste of time, nevertheless, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals because some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals.

My first reason is that some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail. For example, if a person aim too high but fail that person would not feel good about him. Some times people who fail get depressed. If that is a humans who is a persistent person he would be trying more time. Until that person achieve their big goal. Also, that kind of people who are persistent that always keep trying that people one day they achieve all their goals. In addition,

the key to have a awesome overcome is to never give up and never stop.

My second reason is that some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. People who do this are people that always want the easy thing. These people does not want to effort that much and achieve their goals. However, these people do not know the significant of have something that took a lot of efforts. In addition, some people may say that if they aim low they can achieve more things in the time a person that aim too high. Thats not the point, the thing is that every human have to effort to know the significant of never give up. Also, when humans has owned something by their own effort the valuate more what they had achieve.

In summary, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals. Some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. Also, on these latest years humans has been lazy than doesnt want to effort to do big things and achieve it. Now humans really needs to efforts for something. Every human need to aim high and be scared of failing that something normal, but never give up always keep going.",0
"Dear State Senator, Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country our President and Vice President. We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights. I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices.

The Electoral College has major flaws. Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions. Source A in paragraph 12 states, In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly. The other countries would take us as a joke we would simply look like fools. Another thing is, what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote. Source B also in paragraph 12 says, Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. And with that being said, the election would be taken to the HOR House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. And because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing only 500,000 voters, would have much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million. That is the same population as Wyoming only times 70. That is a tremendous difference in population. Don't let our country plummet into bad election. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

Ever since our founding fathers have settled here in America and made the Decloration of Independence in the late 1700s, the Amendments, and everything that gives us the right to be free, the people have had the right to vote. With the Electoral College, the people of America will not be able to freely use that right. Source C says, At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing only on the right races in the swing states. Seventeen states didn't even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000. Those states including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see not one, not two, but zero campaign ads. Just as Source D states, The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people. What if a state sends two state of electors to Congress? It happened in 1960 with Hawaii and luckily VP Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if it happened again? Remember when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush? Thank that to the electoral college. In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes that George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. But why?

First of all, Source E states, So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does. But the problem with this is is that it's simply unfair. The smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do. This is like saying that on the baseball field, the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids don't get to play. It is not fair to the people in the smaller states like Wyoming, to be considered not as good as the state of California. Also in paragraph 20 of Source F says, They are the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. Once again, this statement is unfair. This is favoritism. This is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more thoughtful. Once again, people deserve to have their rights so I say, let them vote.

People want to make their own decisions. It's who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities we want to feel important. With the electoral college we won't be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren't important enough to vote. So it's official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there's a pretty good reason. It's fair. There's only one thing I have to say to you. State Senator, please abolish the electoral college.",0
"Scientist have clues that can lead up to life on mars, but we have no proof. Recently scientist found water on mars, which is needed for life, but we have no set in stone proof that aliens do exist. They are still searching for the proof that they are out there some where, if there is any proof at all. This could all be a search for nothing.

25 years ago an interesting shape was found on the planet Mars. This shape is the shape of an egyption face. Many thought it was a sign of life outside of Earth. It went viral. Really it was a landform common around the American West. The process of creating this was done over many years, many life times. It was not aliens, it was the work of plate techtonics.

One day scientist may find solid proof that aliens exist. They are getting closer and closer to new evidence to new things, some we didn't know existed. But for now, aliens are still mythological and the face is not an alien artifact.",0
"Dear Senator [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concerns and opinions on a topic that has taken center stage in numerous political debates: the Electoral College. After thoughtful consideration and examination of differing viewpoints, I have come to see the necessity of the Electoral College as it currently stands, and I advocate for its preservation.

The Electoral College is delineated in our Constitution as a compromise to balance the election of the President by a popular vote of citizens and by a vote in Congress. Such a system serves multiple practical functions. Posner, in his article In Defense of the Electoral College,” enumerates five reasons for retaining the Electoral College. One of the most compelling points he raises is how the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate achieves cross-regional appeal rather than being a regional favorite. If presidents were elected solely based on popular vote, the focus would largely shift towards densely populated regions, and the distinct issues and voices of smaller regions could easily be marginalized.

Admittedly, the Electoral College has its critics. As Bradford Plumer stated in his article The Indefensible Electoral College, one issue lies in the winner-take-all system used by most states which discourages candidates from campaigning in states they are assured to win or lose. However, Posner also addressed this concern by arguing that focusing on toss-up states ultimately leads to more informed and thoughtful voters in these regions, emphasizing the role of strategic political consideration in the overall process. 

It's also important to emphasize that change to a direct democratic vote isn’t bulletproof to issues. Potential problems such as an election where no candidate secures majority votes might lead to the need for run-off elections, a process that would complicate and prolong the presidential election process. With the Electoral College, a clear winner is invariably produced. 

Admittedly, the Electoral College is not perfect, and like all systems, has its flaws. As such, perhaps it could be of value to consider reasonable modifications to more accurately reflect the popular vote, without completely eliminating the Electoral College. Possibilities could include the adaptation of a Nationwide Vote system, where the proportional representation of Electoral Votes, like that practiced in Maine and Nebraska, is applied across all states. 

In conclusion, I believe the discussion should not center on discarding the Electoral College in its entirety, but rather on how we can evolve it to address modern political realities while preserving its founding purpose. As my representative, I urge you to consider these points when this issue is discussed in the legislative process.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1

"There are many advantages when you limit your car usage. By limiting your car usage you will have to choose a diffrent way of transportation and thats often walking or riding a bike. Those two choices of transportation are often used as stress relivers. Also you dont have to worry about traffic or having to rush out of work for the gym beacause you have all ready got in a little excrise

For exapmle in source 3 car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota it says  It's a good opporunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,. Also when limiting your car usage people often turn to walking, or biking as i've stated before. when a city has a high populltion of walkers and bikers they will have to start making public places closer. As stated in source 1 (¶ 6)  In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.When walking you can get a really nice excrise in when getting from place to place and riding a bike can also get your legs in shape. While siting in a car all day dosent help you out at all it's only polluting the air and has you on your butt all day. Less car driving can also mean less car wrecks.

Often people are late to work because of rush hour. As stated in source 2 (¶14)Congestion was down 60 precent in the capital of france. while riding a bike you dont really have to think about traffic. Another problem with driving is parking the less cars the less you'll have to worry about a parking space.",0
"Failure plays in the pursuit of success. Although some say that success shouldn't be consist of failure because a failure makes you a loser, not a winner, actually failure plays in the pursuit of success because people fail, but they learn from their mistakes and it's positively affects people personalty.

Those who believes success shouldn't be consist of failure have their reason. Some say failure may negatively affects people in their life. But, success makes people feel proud and enthusiasm. Because a failure makes you a loser, not a winner.

Failure helps people to find their a path to success. People fail, but they can learn from their mistakes. For example, I took math test last week, and I didn't do well on the test. My score was 50 out of 100. So, I checked my test paper, and I saw what mistakes I got and learned from it. Then, I retook the test, and I got 91 out of 100, I was proud; after, I saw my score.

I know many people hate failing, they think it's negatively affects their life. But, failing is sometimes there's benefits because it's positively affects people personality. Such as, hard working, proud, and encourage. First, people have their dreams, some wants to be a football player, or some wants to be a president. They need to work hard to accomplish their dreams. Some people fail or success, but they are working hard to accomplish their dreams.

Lastly, pride and encouragement. For example, I have cousin who into sports, and he is in race track. there was a race in high school between Generic_School. So, my cousin was in it. He's family was there and I was there, too. we saw the race, we were encouraging and cheering for him. So, he came in second place. I was mad at first, and I saw my cousin smiling. I told him, why are you smiling? He said, I'm happy that you guys came, to see me race. he was so proud. I was happy for him. He didn't care if he is second or last. He cares about his relative cheering for him.

Conclusion, Failure plays in the pursuit of success. I believe failure helps people to find their a path to success. People fail, but they can learn from their mistakes and it's positively affects people personalty. Such as, hard working, proud, and encourage",0
"Modern Corporate Mergers: An Analysis of the Pros and Cons. In recent years, the business world has seen a surge in corporate mergers. Companies are merging for various reasons ranging from cost-savings to increased market share and even tax benefits. But what exactly does a merger mean for companies involved? What potential pros and cons should be considered? This essay will provide an analysis of modern corporate mergers by examining both the positives and negatives associated with such transactions. The most common benefit of corporate mergers is that they can lead to significant cost savings. By combining resources, organizations can reduce overhead expenses while still maintaining efficiency levels. Additionally, these types of deals often result in economies of scale as large corporations may have access to more capital or facilities than smaller entities do on their own. In addition, larger firms may be able to negotiate better prices with suppliers due to their increased size and buying power. Another positive aspect related to modern corporate mergers is that they allow businesses greater access into new markets which could not previously be accessed due solely by one entity alone. For example, if two companies within different industries were considering joining forces, then this could open up opportunities for them in areas where neither had been operating before – providing greater potential for growth and success overall. Furthermore, such collaborations also serve as a way for firms to diversify their product lines; thus allowing them more stability during times when certain markets experience downturns or disruptions - ultimately resulting in higher profits over time compared against single-industry operations exposed only outwardly towards one sector or geographic area alone at any given moment in time. . . 		. 	. 	. 	. 	. . Finally, there is evidence suggesting that many successful instances of “mega”-merging (such as AT&T/Time Warner) can lead towards synergy effects which help boost efficiency levels even further; thereby creating competitive advantages over rivals who lack similar integration strategies within their respective firm",1
"Dear State Senator, we should not keep the Electoral College. I'm in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The electorsal college is unfair. It's outdated and irrational. Many people prefer election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. They shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president.

One of my reasons is because under the electorsal college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electorss, who in turn elect for the president. The electorss can be anyone not holding public office. Depending on the state, the electorss are picked by state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. The electorsal college isn't the best way to handle elections because it is the electorss who elect the president, not the people, which to me sounds unfair. Voters can't always control who their electorss will vote for and voters do get confused sometimes about the electorss. So if you really agreed on one president, chances are that might not be the president who's gonna be elected because the electorss can choose the other person running for president instead.

The electorsal college is unfair. The electorsal college consists of 538 electorss. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the president. Richard Nixo, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all agreed on abolishing the electorsal act. According to a gallop poll in 2000, over sixty percent of voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Voters don't want the popular vote winner to lose the presidency but because of the electorsal college it can happen. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electorss.

Lets say that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electorss. Those electorss can always defy the will of the people. Faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they pleased. Why on earth would they do such a thing. They should care about what voters believe in. In 1960, people who favored separation based on race in the Louisiana legislature nearly actually succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss so that they would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means the popular votes would not have actually gone to Kennedy. That is not fair. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus only on the tight races in the swing states.

State Senator, I'm in favor of changing to election by popular votes because it's fair. The electorsal college should stay in the past and should'nt be used anymore. The best way is for the election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and decided to vote for whoever they wanted. Selfish much? People shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president. These electorss should consider what the people want. I believe Elections by popular votes for president of the united states is the best option.",0
"The author claim is that NASA is working on a way to visit venus despite how dangerous it is. They are planning on how they are going to visit Venus wihtout being harmed. In the author claim the reason they thought of The challenge of Exploring Venus is to show that even though it could be dangerous to go to Venus but they imagination of Venus makes them want to visit it discover things. The author claim could also be that nothing is impossible because reguardless of how dangerous Venus is Nasa still wants to go and explore it.

In Paragraph 6 it describes how NASA is palnning on visiting Venus despite the dangers . In the text it says , However, perring at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions becausze most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere , rending stand forms of photography and videography ineffective.  This shows that they are still planning to visit Venus despite its dangers .

The text also states how they are trying to visit Venus without being harmed . In paragraph 6 it says  At thirty - plus miles about surface , a vehical hovering oevr Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.  This shows how NASA is pannign the trip but without getting harmed.

 My last author claim is that the author belives that nothing is impossible . Reguardless of how dangerous Venus is for the NASA people to visit they still want to make it possible to go. In paragraph 8 it says , 

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. This shows how the author claim can be nothing is impossible .

In conclusion the author claim presents how the author is planning how to get to Venus , how to get to Venus without being harmed, and how nothing is impossible.

In my first claim in paragraph 6 Nasa is planning on how to get to Venus. In the text it says  However, perring at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions becausze most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere , rending stand forms of photography and videography ineffective.

This shows how the author claim is proven that they are planning on how to get to Venus . My second author claim that NASA is finding a way they can get to Venus without being harmed is proved in parahraph 6. In the text it says ,  At thirty - plus miles about surface , a vehical hovering oevr Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.  For my last author claim that NASA believes anything is possible is presented in paragraph 8. In the text it says , Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. For these reasons proves my author claims that no matter how dangerous Venus is the author belives it is still worthy to discover.",0
"The conservation of wilderness areas and the development of these lush environments for economic gains have been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that these areas should remain untouched in their natural state, others believe that it is beneficial to harness their economic potential. I believe that preserving the wilderness areas in their natural state is critical as they offer numerous benefits that are not only environmental but also economic.

Firstly, preserving wilderness areas in their natural state has immense environmental advantages. These areas are home to several rare and endemic species of flora and fauna that need to be protected. These species are critical to maintaining the ecological balance of the planet. Moreover, wilderness areas serve as a vital buffer zone for clean air and water. Forests, for instance, play a crucial role in regulating water cycles and purifying the air. Therefore, preserving wilderness areas is fundamental to ensuring environmental sustainability.

Secondly, preserving wilderness areas has immense economic benefits. These benefits include tourism, research, and development of new medicines. Tourists from all over the world visit wilderness areas to enjoy their beauty and wildlife. In turn, this provides significant revenue for the countries that host these areas. For instance, the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and the Kruger National Park in South Africa generate millions of dollars in tourism revenue each year. Additionally, the preservation of wilderness areas also allows scientists to conduct research on endangered species and their habitats. This research has led to the development of several new medicines and technologies, which are worth billions of dollars.

On the other hand, the development of wilderness areas for economic gain has several disadvantages. Firstly, this development destroys the natural habitat of several species, leading to loss of biodiversity. These species play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of the planet. Secondly, the development of wilderness areas often leads to deforestation, which contributes to climate change. Deforestation results in the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which contributes to the greenhouse effect. This effect leads to global warming, which has adverse effects on weather patterns and ecosystems.

Furthermore, the development of wilderness areas for economic gain may not be sustainable in the long term. In most cases, exploitation of these areas results in depletion of natural resources. This depletion may lead to the collapse of the ecosystem, making it impossible to continue exploiting the area.

In conclusion, preserving wilderness areas in their natural state is paramount for environmental sustainability and has immense economic benefits in terms of tourism and research. While the development of wilderness areas may generate economic gains, it is not sustainable, and it has several environmental disadvantages. It is, therefore, important for nations to preserve their wilderness areas in their natural state for the benefit of all.",1
"Making decisions for ourselves is an invaluable part of life. It not only helps steer us in the right direction as an individual, but also allows us to have more freedom and independence. However, making our own decisions can also have its drawbacks. One example is found in the story of Generic_Name. Generic_Name relied heavily on someone else to make decisions for them, and in the end faced dire consequences. This example serves to show that when we depend on someone else to make decisions for us, we can be taking away the chance to make our own mistakes and learn from them. Without having a role model in life, it can be difficult to find success. Having a mentor that we can look up to and depend on can be incredibly beneficial, but it also important to trust in our own judgment and rely on ourselves when making decisions. When we make decisions based on our own principles and ideals, it gives us the chance to live and experience life in our own terms, rather than letting other peoples' opinions take precedence. Ultimately, we have to understand that we cannot live life under someone else's rule our entire life, and make decisions that are in our own best interest.",1
"Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth due to it being the most Earth like planet in our solar system. Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features to Earth such as valleys, mountains, and also craters.

If we were to explore Venus and learn more about it we could use it as a backup plan or Earth incase something were to happen to the current one, not to mention it can be crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. But traveling to Venus can be dangerous. Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus for more than 3 decades,97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, the clouds highly contain sulfuric acid, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater, and it can be really hot, hotter than mercury even. But scientist in NASA are finding ways and building new technologies to study about Venus. For example bump-like vehicles hovering 30 or so miles above the landscape to avoid any unfriendly conditions by staying in the air. It would still be hot and the air pressure would be close to sea level but it would be survivable for humans.

Although it would provide a limited amount of sight, you would still have to chance to not only see but to explore safely and learn more about Venus. Traveling to study Venus will not only answer unanswered questions, but can come in our favors in the future. Yes, it will be dangerous but it will teach survival and give us answers.",0
"Many people across the country would believe that having an Electoral College is good idea. Well, I believe that it is not a good idea to continue having an Electoral College to chose our president because the people deserve to have their votes count. In the process of having an Electoral College the popular votes do not count, only the slate of electors can vote for the candidate. That's not even the worst part to begin with.

In source 2, it says that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half the amount of voters in the country! It even states In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. meaning that sometimes the electors would not always have the same idea in mind as the people have. To me that is a real bummer especially for the people in the state with those kinds of electors.

Furthermore, the Electoral college may have a few benefits as it states in source 3. Fore example, it says The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. meaning that barely anyone would vote in the state. But that is usually a rare occasion and is easily avoided in every state. As individuals we would usually not avoid coming to vote in an election for certain positions especially when it comes to a president.

Sometimes people would even let the Electoral College vote for them without the people knowing who they voted for. The Electoral College is supposed to represent their state towards a candidate but what if the state rarely has any electors to be represented or doesn't have any at all? That is why it is up to the people to make their own decision in who they want to vote for and hopefully their vote counts. The Electorial College may be recomended to represent their state but they can never represent every individual's vote because not all people have the same candidate in mind and the Electorial College can only vote for one candidate.

Overall, I think the Electoral College should be abolished in every way. It is the people's vote that should count not the electors. Some people may disagree but I still believe the Electorial College is not good for us. It is not truely fair to have the majority of popular votes on one candidate and still that candidate does not win due the Electoral College. So I can most certainly agree with what previous people and groups have said before such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerance, and the AFLCIO.... To get rid of the Electoral College.",0
"What if cars were never invented? What if cars were so much money no one will be able to buy them? Limiting the usage of cars can help the economy and help the environment in many ways. Places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota have banned the usage of cars. They say that since they have did that congestion in the cities have gone down. Polluted cities aren't as crowded as they use to since they have banned the usage of cars.

Vauban, Germany is one of the places that has banned the usage of cars. You can still own a car but there are only two places to park your car, large garages at the end of a development or buy a psace along with a home. In article one it stated that,  More than 70 percent of Vauban's familis do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here, People siad that having a car was tense and kind of too much pressure when in a crowded city. In 2006 Vauban had become an example of  a growing trend in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, they have been the most advanced experiment in low car usage. Stores are placed on the walk away or on a main street, rather than in malls or on a distant highway.

Paris have a near-record pollution so they enfroced a partial drivning ban the clear some of the air in the global city. Motorists with even and odd-numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home or they suffer and fine of 22-euros. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-sevn people had thier cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. Congestion was down nearly 60 percent in the capital of France after five days after the enforement of the driving fine. SInce Paris has generally more smog than other European capitals diesel fueal was blamed for it. Diesel fuel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Delivery companies complained about the lost of revenue for cars. In aritcle two it siad, Public transportation was free of charge from Friday to Monday, the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for odd-numbered car plates on Tuesday.

Bogota, Columbia have banned usage of cars for three years straight. Cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day. Thier goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Anybody that violated that suffered a fine of $25 dollars. Aritcle 3 buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said It;s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, meaning that cutting down car usage with lower the greenhouse gases in the air and clear it up. Dyas without cars is a part of a improvement capaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s, it has been the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Parks and sport centers and have bulid throughout the city. Pitted sidewalks have been replaced with smooth sidewalks, rush-hour restirctions have cut traffic dramatically, new resturants and upscale shopping ditstricts have cropped up. Bannig cars in Bogota has been the best thing that has ever happened to the city.

In 2013, President Obama had ambitious goals to curb the United States's greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies have shown that many Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. In article 4 it said that as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995, part of that is because many Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. Demographic shifts in the driving population have made the trend of banning car accelerate.

In conclusion, banning cars will a successful rate on not just the United States but the world. Maybe people should actually look and promote the idea to see if it will help our economy and or environment. Without cars polluted cities will be able to breath fresh air and won't have to worry about payign for gas. Banning cars could be the best thing that will happen to the world.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is an emerging trend in many parts of the world, driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote alternative transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities. Several case studies illustrate the advantages of limiting car usage, such as the car-free district of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By adopting smart planning strategies, reducing dependency on cars, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, cities and communities can benefit from cleaner air, reduced congestion, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life.

Body Paragraph 1: Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The transportation sector, particularly passenger cars, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times article, cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and combating climate change. The case of Vauban, Germany, where 70% of families do not own cars, demonstrates how a car-free lifestyle can significantly reduce carbon footprints.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Air Quality and Public Health
Vehicular emissions are a major source of air pollution, especially in densely populated cities. The driving ban in Paris due to smog, as reported by the Chicago Tribune, resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This temporary measure brought about a 60% decrease in congestion and highlighted the negative health effects of car usage. By limiting car usage, communities can enjoy cleaner air, reduce respiratory illnesses, and promote overall public health.

Body Paragraph 3: Reduced Congestion and Enhanced Livability
The introduction of car-free districts and car-free days, such as the ones in Vauban and Bogota respectively, showcase the potential for reduced congestion and enhanced livability. These initiatives create space for alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, and public transit. The Seattle Times article on Bogota's car-free day highlights how millions of Colombians experienced a day devoid of traffic jams, promoting efficient transportation and a better urban environment. Additionally, car-free districts result in walkable communities with improved access to amenities like shops, schools, and parks.

Body Paragraph 4: Economic Benefits and Diverse Transportation Options 
Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. The New York Times article mentions how car ownership rates have declined even before the recession, indicating a broader cultural shift. This shift led companies like Ford and Mercedes to rebrand themselves as mobility companies with diverse product ranges beyond personal vehicles. By embracing alternative transportation options like car-sharing programs, bike-sharing, and public transit, communities enable residents to save money on transportation costs, reduce the need for parking spaces, and reduce the strain on infrastructure.

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. Case studies from across the world demonstrate the significant impact of reducing car dependency, from reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality to reduced congestion and enhanced livability. By adopting smart planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation, and rethinking the car-centric culture, communities can create sustainable, healthy, and accessible urban environments for all. Embracing these changes will not only benefit individuals but also contribute to the global effort to address climate change and build a better future.",1
"Driving is one of America's favorite things to do, it is looked at as a right of passage, of sorts, for young American's and yet driving is now becoming less and less imoprtant to them. The decrease in the amount of people who are driving and using cars is not only happening in the United States, all over the world people are limiting their car usage. There is a plethora of advantages to limiting car usage with the main three being that it can make people happier by reducing stress, it allow's people to get more excersize, and it can drastically reduce pollution.

First and foremost, people limiting their car usage can make them considerably happier. One reason for this occurance could be that using a motor vehicle less can help reduce stress. In the articleIn German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, when asked Heidrun Walter said that When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.(Rosenthal,3). She lives in a town where there are almost no privately owned motor vehicles. A business man from Bogota,Columbia has also said that using a car less, or even not using one for a day, as they do in Bogota, is a good opportunity to take away stress,(Selsky,24). If people don't have to worry about all of the extra expenses and responsibilities that come with a car, then they will not have any stress regarding them and will be happier.

Likewise, limiting car usage can help people get more excersize and lead to a healthier lifestyle. In his article, Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky describes a program in which cars are banned and only public transportation is allowed on the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Columbia. Bogota has been having a Day Without Cars for 3 years and Selsky says that one of the goals is to promote alternative transportation(Selsky,21). On the Day Without Cars,millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work..., leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.(Selsky,20). Implementing a program like this helps people get excersize by promoting biking and walking to work and can lead to a healthier lifestyle by encouraging people to use those methods of transportation on a daily basis.

Equally as important, when people reduce their car usage it can drastically reduce pollution. Robert Duffer says that After days of near-record pollution,Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air.(Duffer,10) in his article, Paris bans driving due to smog. Duffer says that in Paris the ban was set up so that all people with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home on one day and the next day people with odd numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home. If a person violated the ban then they were fined 22 euros. After only five days, congestion was cut down 60 percent according to Duffer and by the next Monday the smog had cleared enough for the French ruling party to rescind the ban(Duffer, 19). By limiting their automobile usage for just one week Paris was able to reduce their air pollution by a large amount. In the article, The End of Car Culture Elisabeth Rosenthal states that if the pattern of less American's buying cars  persists then  it will have benificial implications for carbon emissions and for the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,(Rosenthal,34).

In summation, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can have postitive effects on people and the Earth because it can make people happier by reducing stress, it allow's people to get more excersize and lead healthier lives, and it can drastically reduce pollution. Many sources believe that the advantages of limiting car use greatly outweigh the disadvantages and think that the limited use of motor vehicles will increase in popularity.",0
"Education is an integral part of a person's life. It can often be the difference between success and failure, both in one's personal and professional life. For this reason, it is essential to receive quality education from reliable sources. With the advent of technology, online learning has become increasingly popular as more people are able to access educational content from their homes or on-the-go with their mobile devices. In recent years, online education has seen remarkable growth due to its convenience and accessibility for students all over the world. People no longer need to commute long distances or pay expensive tuition fees; they simply have to choose which course they want to take and sign up - either through a university website or through an accredited platform such as Coursera or Udemy. Online courses offer great flexibility while still providing high quality information thanks to detailed lectures provided by leading experts in various fields along with different interactive activities like quizzes and forums where students can discuss problems related to each topic discussed in class. The range of available topics is incredibly wide: anything from engineering sciences (mechanics, physics) via languages (English, French) all the way up to business economics (finance, accounting). Additionally there are many free courses that anyone can access at any time so that not only those who have money but also those who don’t can gain knowledge about any kind of subject that interests them without having a financial burden attached to it. However there are some drawbacks associated with online learning too; for example if you require assistance understanding something you may not be able get personalized help since most teachers spend most of their time giving instructions rather than helping individual students grasp concepts better during class times - although nowadays platforms allow users/students contact instructors directly via emails when needed . Another issue could arise if internet connection was disrupted suddenly leaving student unable continue working on assigned tasks until problem resolved thus adding extra stress into whole situation – however using offline services offered by majority modern digital",1
"Aestheticism is a movement in art and literature that emphasizes the beauty of artistic expressions over their meaning or purpose. Aesthetes seek to appreciate the visual, tactile, and sensual qualities of works while also deriving an emotional response from them. This essay will explore how aestheticism has been expressed throughout history as well as its relevance today in modern art and literature. The origins of aestheticism can be traced back to ancient times with the emergence of certain philosophies such as Platonism which valued ideas about perfect forms beyond mere physical appearances. During the 18th century, this concept was further developed by writers such as Immanuel Kant who argued for what he termed disinterested pleasure, meaning a detached appreciation for beauty separate from practical use or moral value judgments. In England during this time period, poet Alexander Pope popularized his notion that beauty is truth, truth beauty through his poetry which helped usher in an era known as Romanticism where emotion and sentimentality took precedence over structure or reason. The 19th century saw aesthetics become firmly established with figures like John Ruskin emphasizing feelings rather than facts when evaluating works focussing on elements such as line quality and color harmony to create visually pleasing compositions with no underlying narrative content. The Pre-Raphaelites sought inspiration from medieval artwork primarily creating beautiful paintings featuring naturalistic landscapes populated with classical figures thus merging different periods into one harmonious vision while avoiding traditional storytelling tropes altogether to focus instead on pure sensory experiences derived from looking at their creations directly without any external context being needed. . The 20th century brought along more abstract movements like cubism and surrealism which experimented heavily with color palettes, shapes, patterns all designed specifically to evoke emotion without necessarily having logical connections between them providing viewers a unique perspective on reality allowing them access into realms unseen by those outside these new creative circles. More recently there have been postmodernist artists who combine both representational imagery alongside nonrepresentational components forcing audiences to",1

Dear [Senator’s Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and the presidential election process in the United States. As a high school student, I have learned about the pros and cons of both the Electoral College and the popular vote system. After careful consideration, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place.

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that all states have a say in the election. This is because each state is assigned a certain number of electors based on its population. Therefore, even small states have a chance to influence the outcome of the election. If we were to switch to a popular vote system, candidates would only focus on campaigning in the most populous states, leaving smaller states without a voice.

Furthermore, the Electoral College helps to prevent a candidate from winning solely based on the popular vote. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must win a majority of electoral votes. This means that they must have support from a wide range of states, not just the ones with the largest populations. This ensures that the president is elected by a diverse group of people, not just those in a few highly populated areas.

While there are certainly some drawbacks to the Electoral College, such as the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular vote, I believe that the benefits outweigh the costs. The Electoral College has been a part of our election process since the founding of our country, and it has served us well. I urge you to support the continued use of the Electoral College in presidential elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"Devices are the most common distract ion everywhere in the world. Once someone is distracted they might not know what may begoing on around them. Devices are most ly used as a distract ion while driving and cause horrifying accidents.

Distracted drivers are far more dangerous t han intoxicated drivers. Being on a device can put you and other people around you in danger. Teenagersare mostly the cause of accidents knowing that most teens die due to accidents more than adults. Teen also get distracted very easil y as a cause to destruction on the road.

Driving with a device in hand can lead to death or injury to thousands of other people. You may injure the passenger or the people in your backseat and as an effect of the injury, the person's family could sue or press charges on you.

It is best to pay att enti on than pay for your car or junk your car. No one likes to pay a large amount of money for anything, so why put yourself and others in danger with a devicein your hand? The paym ent of an accident is alr eady high enough and the car insurance payment might also be high (depending on what carinsuranceyou have). And say if you don't havecar insurance? Guess your car is getting towed. NO! Stay off your phone and pay attention.

You sho u ld no t be on your device while driving because you can get into a accident, you can get injured or die, and your money might get taken. It' s best to stay off your phone and focus on the road.",0
"The right to choose elective classes is of the utmost importance for students. This choice allows students to explore different interests, diversify their education, and pursue passions both in and outside of their normal academic endeavors. Forcing students to take every elective class can be a waste of time because it does not allow for students to follow natural inclinations that are unique to them. 

Not every student enjoys the same classes, and it is to the benefit of the student, teacher, and school system if students are able to explore what they are genuinely interested in. This will encourage diligent study and draw out a creative and thoughtful approach to new material. Having the freedom to pick and choose elective classes can also open the student up to unexpected interests they may not have known to have before. 

Requiring students to take a certain set of elective classes could also result in a time-consuming process without a significant educational benefit. Students can be made to complete classes they have little interest in, joining in lectures with minimal engagement or enthusiasm. If students had more choice, their motivation and improved engagement could lead to better learning. 

In conclusion, allowing students the choice of what elective classes to take is of the utmost importance. Offering students the ability to evaluate each class and make an informed decision about their own personal education can have significant impacts on both the teaching staff and the student body, boosting motivation to learn and succeed in their studies.",1
"Some schools permit their students use cellphones in classroom for educational purposes. There is so many good and bad effects allowing students use their phone for educational puroposes .They can be more bad reasons than good reason beause we have to think how really they are going to use their cellphones, and if it's for educational purpose.

I think allow their cellphones to students is not a good idea because we know that we are young people, and we are not going to use our phone just for educational purposes; we are going to use :our apps , social media ,and that is going to distract our attention in class, makes us faild or test because weare not using our resource for good reason; we know there are students without resposabilities and that's what make cellphones a bad opction.

Some people may think that use our phone in classes can be a good idea because we are going to have more access to technology at school, and more easy research for our classwork. Also people think that we are going to have more privacity for our work. Students said that they can be resposinble at the moment to use their chellphones just for educational purposes.

Allowing cellphones for students can have good and bad effects , it can have good effects because is a easy option for students having their phone for: research information resources, have easy acess to internet ,see videos educationals abut the subject, and find deep information about the subject. The bad effect for students can be :they are going to get distracting , they are not going to do their classwork,and for all that reasons they can lose their classes.

My first reason is cellphones in class are not good tools for students ,because cellphones distract and make students lose their attention to class.

My second reason is cellphones is not a thing that we need for learn because our parents, teachers ,family in their time was no cellphone ,and they learn by other resources like books ,so is not a thing that we really need. there are computers we can use them for when we really needed .

My third reason is that cellphone is not necessary for our educational purpose because we can have better resources than a cellphone ; we have the most beautiful thing in this world and that are books our better resource.

Some schools allow their students to use their cellphone to a educational purpose they think that is a good idea to have cellphones in their classroom but in my opinion is a distracting thing ,and is not necessary for our educational purpose ; we have good tools for example one are the books and internet but not using our cellphones at class because we know that we are not goin to use for educational purpose, and cellphone are going to distract us.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are vast and impactful. As shown in various studies and examples from around the world, reducing car dependency can lead to numerous benefits for individuals, communities, and the environment.

One key advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, and by limiting car usage, we can greatly contribute to the effort of reducing our carbon footprint. For example, in Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in certain car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent (Rosenthal, 2009). By promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating car-free zones, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of public health and air quality. The harmful effects of air pollution caused by car emissions are well-known. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease air pollution levels and subsequently improve the overall air quality in our communities. This is evident in the case of Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog. As a result, congestion was reduced by 60 percent, and the city experienced a significant improvement in air quality (Duffer, 2014). Similar initiatives have been successful in other cities as well, such as Bogota, where a car-free day led to a reduction in traffic congestion and promoted alternative forms of transportation (Selsky, 2002).

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and compact urban planning. Traditional suburbs, centered around car ownership and usage, have contributed to the spread of urban sprawl and all its associated problems. However, there is a growing trend in creating car-free or low-car suburban communities, where cars are restricted and alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and public transit, are prioritized. Vauban in Germany is an example of such a community, where streets are car-free, and stores are placed within walking distance (Rosenthal, 2009). This approach not only promotes a more sustainable lifestyle but also creates more vibrant and accessible communities.

In addition to the environmental and urban planning benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on individual well-being. Many people who have given up their cars have reported feeling less stressed and happier. One resident of Vauban in Germany stated, When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way (Rosenthal, 2009). This is indicative of the fact that relying less on cars can lead to a more relaxed and balanced lifestyle. Walking or cycling instead of driving can also contribute to increased physical activity, resulting in improved health and well-being for individuals.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting sustainable urban planning and individual well-being, the benefits are far-reaching. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and creating car-free zones, we can work towards a more environmentally friendly and healthier future for our communities. It is crucial for policymakers and individuals to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and actively support initiatives that promote alternative transportation options.",1
"Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole are some of Americas most beloved politicians, and all of three of them have agreed on the abolishing of the electoral college. This system needs to go. It does not represent this country's ground rules because its nondemocratic and does not give enough recognition to some states across the country.

For starters, the electoral college is nondemocratic. How can a nation that prides itself on being a democracy not have a democratic way of electing its president? With this electoral college system voters do not vote for the president instead they vote for their states electors which presents a problem in my opinion. As stated in Source 3 each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is RARELY broken. While some may feel that a system that is rarely broken is acceptable i do not because this is such a big event in our country and we can not afford to have a flawed system. The trust of an entire states vote can not be put in the hands of one elector. America does not get what its people want through this system as you can tell when Source 2 states Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency. This is not a Democratic way of doing things as the people should be able to elect there president and not have a state of electors do so for them.

Now that the issue of Democracy has been taken care of i want to talk about how some of the states in this country do not get the recognition they deserve. Everyone agrees that all states should have a say in the election of the president and all should feel that there votes matter but this is not the case with the electoral college. As Source 2 states that during the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. This is not acceptable because all voters no matter where they live should feel that there vote is wanted and matters. This could be part of the reason that about only half of the countrys eligible voters voted in the 2012 election as stated in Source 3. While some may say that the electoral college is a great system because it prevents ties i disagree because the likely hood of a tie in the first place when doing popular vote is extremely low and it does not out weight the fact that the people should elect there president.

In the end it is obvious that the electoral college has to go. There is many reasons why but the two main reasons are that its nondemocratic and it does not give recognition to all the states in this wonderful country.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its continued existence or potential replacement by a popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained. In this letter, I will present my claim, address counterclaims, provide evidence from multiple sources, and avoid over-reliance on a single source.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of electors, the voting process by electors for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. Each state's allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, ensuring fair representation (Passage 1).

One counterclaim against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, it is essential to note that democracy does not always mean direct popular vote but can also include representative democracy. The electors, selected by the political parties, have a responsibility to vote for their party's nominee, ensuring that the will of the people is represented (Passage 15).

The first reason to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike in a direct popular vote system, disputes over the electoral vote outcome are considerably less likely due to the winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes in most states (Passage 18). This ensures a decisive result and reduces the possibility of extensive recounts or legal challenges, as seen in the 2000 election.

The Electoral College also serves as a means to ensure that the President has trans-regional appeal (Passage 19). No single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, thereby compelling candidates to campaign in various states across different regions. This requirement promotes a broader understanding of regional interests and prevents the disenfranchisement that would occur if a candidate campaigned only in the regions where they were already popular.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, where the election outcome is uncertain (Passage 20). By prioritizing these states, candidates must engage voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have the final say in the election.

The Electoral College also restores some balance to the political influence of large states compared to small states (Passage 21). While the popular vote would allow candidates to focus solely on large population centers, the Electoral College system forces candidates to consider the concerns of smaller states and gives them disproportionately more attention in the campaign process. This ensures that the interests of citizens living in less populated states are not ignored.

Lastly, the Electoral College addresses the issue of run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner (Passage 22). This eliminates the need for the complexities and expenses associated with additional voting rounds. Through this system, the President who garners the most electoral votes is declared the winner, ensuring a decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College, including certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, swing states, balancing the political influence, and avoiding run-off elections, outweigh the counterarguments. The Electoral College provides a fair representation of voters' needs and interests while maintaining the stability and integrity of the presidential election process. It ensures that all states have a voice and that regions with diverse interests are considered.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will take into account the practical reasons supporting the retention of the Electoral College. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

"Education is a life-long process for those who wish to learn and grow. For others, it may be a necessary evil that is required to secure a job. However, I believe that education should be a life-long pursuit because it allows for personal growth, enrichment, and new opportunities.

One of the most important reasons to continue learning is that it allows for personal growth. A person's interests and needs change over time, and it's important to be able to adapt and grow with them. For example, when I was younger, I was interested in learning more about the world around me. As I've gotten older, my interests have shifted to learning more about myself. I've been able to do this by taking classes on topics like meditation and mindfulness.

Education can also be a way to enrich one's life. There are so many amazing things to learn about, and education provides a way to explore them all. For example, I love learning about history, and I've been able to do this by taking classes on history, reading historical fiction, and watching documentaries.

Finally, education can provide new opportunities. For example, I was recently able to get a job that I love because I have a degree in a relevant field. If I didn't have that degree, I would not have been considered for the job. Education can provide opportunities for advancement in one's career, as well as new opportunities to explore.

In conclusion, I believe that education should be a life-long pursuit because it allows for personal growth, enrichment, and new opportunities.",1
"Dear Senator,

I feel that we should change using the Electoral college. The popular vote is much more effective. Using the popular vote to decide who becomes president would show who the citizens of the united states want. The popular vote shows what each state has voted for, using the Electoral college takes the right away for the people being able to vote for the president that they favor. Instead of using what the people voted for they come together to chose the candidate they predict would be the best and do the most for the country and that's not fair. If voting is important to this country then congress should understand that when the poeple vote for something everyone wants it to be their decisions that makes one of the two canidates become president not who the Electoral college believes would be best. If we could overcome the debate between what process works better more people might vote.

Although some citizens believe that the Electoral college is a good idea. I feel that if they compared not having the electoral college and only using the popular vote durning voting periods they would feel they system is more effisent. One example is big states could make a tremdous impact on which canidate wins the electon. These states have more people with more opinions that should be used durning the time of the electon for the president.

Some of the problems with the Electoral college is not only do voters not vote for their president, Back in 1960  The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Deomcratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy ( So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy). In that same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please That is not what we are promised as a country. It states that the electoral college is suppose to cast a vote on what their state wants and what their state has chosen. That year the right to do so was taken away. Voting is a serious matter. Popular vote would clearifiy what each states popular favor is, who they want, and which candidate their vote was to be casted for.

I hope with all the information that I have just provided you with above will help to show you that the popular vote isn't only what most people want it's also the better choice.",0
"Have you ever wondered what the most important aspect of being a successful entrepreneur is? It goes without saying that entrepreneurial success requires hard work, dedication and a good idea. However, more often than not these things alone are not enough to guarantee success in business. One key factor that can make or break an entrepreneur’s chances at success is their ability to effectively manage risk. Risk management is integral for entrepreneurs as it allows them to take calculated risks when making decisions that have an uncertain outcome such as launching new products or entering into new markets. Risk management involves anticipating potential problems and mitigating losses before they become unmanageable. The effective use of risk management strategies can provide entrepreneurs with valuable insight into how best to handle certain situations while also reducing the likelihood of substantial losses due to unforeseen circumstances. In addition, managing risk appropriately helps protect assets while boosting profitability in the long run. One way entrepreneurs can mitigate some of their risks is by utilizing financial hedging techniques such as derivatives trading and options contracts which help reduce uncertainty surrounding investments by providing investors with predetermined returns or specified payouts should particular market conditions occur within agreed-upon timelines. Additionally, having adequate insurance coverage and/or contingency plans can help minimize potential damages resulting from unexpected occurrences like natural disasters or legal issues stemming from negligence on behalf of third parties associated with the business enterprise itself. Entrepreneurs may even consider setting up trust accounts which would allow them access to funds in case unforeseen events occur thereby enabling businesses to remain afloat during times of crisis rather than defaulting on payments thus avoiding closure altogether in severe cases where failure could be inevitable otherwise. . In conclusion, effective risk management provides entrepreneurs with invaluable information about what steps need taken prior to making any major decisions regarding their businesses regardless if those choices seem profitable initially or not since sometimes taking no action can prove just as beneficial (if not more so) than rushing headlong into potentially disastrous scenarios without proper forethought first – something all successful entrepreneurs should strive towards",1
"In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the practice of urban gardening. Those who live in cities often lack access to fresh fruits and vegetables due to limited land availability and high costs associated with purchasing produce from grocery stores or farmers markets. Urban gardening is an effective solution for increasing access to locally grown produce while also promoting environmental sustainability. Urban gardening involves growing plants in small spaces such as balconies, rooftops, window boxes or even pots on windowsills. It can be done anywhere within a city where soil conditions are suitable for plant growth, including vacant lots or abandoned properties that can be repurposed into green spaces. With the right planning and consideration for available resources, it is possible to maximize yields by using various techniques such as companion planting and vertical gardens. Additionally, some cities offer grants to support community garden projects which help build strong relationships between neighbors while promoting food security and enhancing public health outcomes through increased physical activity outside of traditional exercise facilities . The benefits of urban gardening go far beyond providing access to healthy food options; they also improve air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles while releasing oxygen into the atmosphere; reduce noise pollution by acting as buffers between streetside traffic; promote biodiversity by creating habitats for birds, insects and other wildlife; decrease water runoff during heavy rain events thanks to improved soil absorption capabilities of large scale vegetation coverings; plus give individuals a sense purposeful work towards improving their community's environment overall – all at low cost per capita when compared with most public works projects!. Urban gardens provide numerous opportunities for education about sustainable agriculture practices such as composting organic waste materials instead sending them offsite landfills (reducing methane emissions), avoiding the use pesticides or synthetic fertilizers (which may leach into nearby groundwater sources) , choosing drought tolerant species (to conserve precious water resources), plus many more topics too extensive list here today! Ultimately this type creative project-based learning helps empower people become better stewards their own local",1
"Young people are an invaluable resource to their country. They are the future of the nation, and their contributions are essential for the growth and development of the nation. Unfortunately, governments may overlook some of the issues faced by young people in running the country. I disagree with this notion and believe that governments should pay attention to the problems faced by young people and take necessary steps to address them.

To begin with, young people are the most affected by the decisions taken by the government. They are the ones who will have to live with the consequences of the government’s actions. Therefore, it is important for the government to consider their needs and concerns when making decisions. For example, when the government is making decisions about education, it'should consider the needs of young people and ensure that they have access to quality education. Similarly, when the government is making decisions about employment, it'should ensure that young people have access to job opportunities that are suitable for their skills and qualifications.

Furthermore, young people are the most affected by the economic and social policies of the government. They are the ones who will have to bear the brunt of any economic downturn or social unrest. Therefore, it is important for the government to take into account the needs and concerns of young people when formulating economic and social policies. For instance, when the government is making decisions about taxation, it'should consider the impact of taxation on young people and ensure that it is not too burdensome for them. Similarly, when the government is making decisions about social welfare, it'should ensure that young people are not left behind and are provided with the necessary support.

In conclusion, it is important for governments to pay attention to the problems faced by young people and take necessary steps to address them. Young people are the future of the nation and their contributions are essential for the growth and development of the nation. Therefore, it is important for the government to consider their needs and concerns when making decisions and formulating policies.",1
"I agree with Prime Winston Churchill; in he saying there is a lot of true and motivation. Failure is the most important element in the pursuit of success. Being successful is not a easy thing for anyone; there is a journey that you have to get through with many obstacles that you may fail at the first time. Also, no matter how many times you fail, you shouldn't give up on you want to do. When you continue to fail, your learn a lot from this mistakes or problems. The better thing are never easy to secure; we always make mistakes, but never too late to start again. As Winston once said success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm'' This statement is most certainly true if we are welling go put in the effort to past though feature and attain real success.

If you really want something you going struggle for that and effort the most you can. Everyone who is successful has been through things that has caused them to fail in something the admired dearly, but remember you should never lose hope; mistakes allow you to view your challenge from a different perspective. Failure is only an opportunity to begin again, only this time with a better plan and more understanding. Failure is an unavoidable obstacle, so you must be ready to affront and learn about it. Look examples about people who don't lose hope and keep trying until they did it, and see that these people are representation of success. See the mountain they've claimed and look to it for inspiration and all they sacrifice.

In conclusion, we come to learn more from our failures and difficulties than from our successes. Failure can bring us to better ourselves and begin our plans once more, this time more wisely. If everyone was to successes in their first try, we would not feel accomplished in the presence of success. The most important message to take from these quote is that after you have acknowledge both why failed and how it made you feel, you must attack the obstacle again with enthusiasm. Success it is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all love of what you are doing or learning to do.",0
"I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. There are a number of reasons why this is a good idea. For one, it allows people to try out new ideas and experiences, which can be risky but can lead to new and more successful insights. It also allows people to learn from their mistakes, which can be valuable information that they can use to improve their future endeavours. Lastly, taking risks can help people to learn and grow, which can be a valuable asset in any career or life endeavour.

So, in summary, successful people are those who are willing to take risks and learn from their mistakes. This allows them to grow and develop their skills as well as their knowledge and understanding of the world. It also allows them to be more successful in the future.",1

The university education is important for students because it helps them to get a job. Most employers prefer to hire university graduates. University graduates have the skills and knowledge that employers are looking for. They can also communicate well and work independently.

The university education also helps students to develop their critical thinking skills. They learn to question information and to think critically about it. This is important in today’s world, where there is a lot of misinformation.

The university education also helps students to become more independent. They learn to manage their time and to work independently. This is important in the workplace, where they will need to be able to work independently.

"I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are many reasons for this belief. First, facts can be easily forgotten. Second, students can often misinterpret facts. Third, students can often get bogged down in the details of facts, which can prevent them from understanding the big picture. Fourth, facts can be easily manipulated. Finally, facts can be changed, which can invalidate them.

All of these reasons make it important for students to understand ideas and concepts. Concepts are more durable than facts. They can be remembered and used again. They can be interpreted in different ways, which allows for different perspectives to be considered. They can be applied to new situations, which allows for new insights to be gained.

In short, concepts are more important than facts. This is why it is important for students to understand them.",1
"To specialize in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

I agree with this statement. I think it is important to know a lot about many different areas of study. For example, if I want to be a doctor, I need to learn about anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, microbiology, and immunology. These are just a few of the many subjects that I would like to study in college. If I wanted to become a lawyer, it would be important for me to get a good education in law, economics, history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, political science, etc. It would also be good to understand the history of science and technology, as well as the social and political aspects of these fields.

"The use of mobile phones in the classroom has been an ongoing debate for many years now. While some argue that having a phone present is disruptive and distracting, others believe it to be a necessary tool within the educational space. Despite this seemingly divided opinion, there are evident benefits that come with allowing students to bring their phones into the classroom. To begin with, by having access to their device during class time, students can easily search up additional information regarding a topic or lesson discussed throughout the day. This extra knowledge allows them to deepen their understanding of material, which is especially beneficial considering our current digital age where almost any piece of information can be accessed at one’s fingertips. Additionally, being able to research topics on-the-go ensures that misunderstood concepts do not remain stagnant but instead can quickly be clarified and further explored through online sources such as websites and magazines. Ultimately this helps increase student engagement since they have immediate access to tools needed for learning success without having any interruption in instruction time due to delays from computer lab requests or other technology issues. Moreover, giving students permission to use mobile phones encourages them become more independent learners who take initiative when researching materials related to classroom topics as opposed those relying solely on lectures from teachers alone due lack of access resources outside school hours .Furthermore it also pushes educators towards creating interactive lessons plans by incorporating activities such as QR code scavenger hunts or group web searches all while still adhering standardized teaching methods set forth district guidelines .This overall allows full classes participate actively process new ideas rather than just passively listening instructions given teacher desk.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or changed to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analysis of the information from multiple sources, including the texts provided, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. It ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote surpasses their share of the popular vote, making it less likely for disputes over the election’s outcome to occur. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner-take-all basis of most states' allocation of electoral votes leads to landslide victories for the winning candidate, thereby reducing the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College fosters the idea of a president being everyone's president. This system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal since no single region has enough electoral votes to determine the outcome. As mentioned by Judge Posner, a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president as it may leave residents of other regions feeling disregarded and disenfranchised. By necessitating candidates to broaden their appeal beyond a single region, the Electoral College ensures that the elected president represents the entire nation's interests.

Moreover, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, encouraging candidates to pay close attention to the concerns and issues faced by voters in these states. As stated in Judge Posner's text, swing states receive extensive campaign efforts and information from candidates due to their potential to decide the election. This engagement fosters thoughtful voting, as voters in these states have a greater incentive to closely evaluate and consider the candidates' policies and plans for the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political balance that large states might otherwise lose due to the Senate's malapportionment. According to Judge Posner, the Electoral College gives large states more attention from presidential candidates, as victories in these states yield a higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on the concerns of smaller states, which could lead to the neglect of the interests of larger, more populous states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections by ensuring that a majority winner is always determined. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College eliminates the pressure for run-off elections when no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast. This simplifies the presidential election process, avoiding further complications and costs associated with additional voting rounds.

While some argue that a change to a popular vote system would make the electoral process fairer, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks. Moving to a popular vote system would concentrate campaign efforts solely on densely populated urban areas and neglect the interests of smaller states and rural communities. Additionally, it could potentially lead to run-off elections and endless recounts when no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept due to the certainty of outcome, the principle of everyone's president, the focus on swing states, the balance it brings to large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. While improvements can always be made to the system, the Electoral College effectively serves its purpose of representing the diverse interests of the American people. I urge you to consider the valuable aspects of the Electoral College when evaluating potential changes to our electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to seeing our system flourish while maintaining its integrity.

Sincerely,

"When it comes to achieving success in school, time management is key. Many high school and college students struggle with managing their time effectively, leading to missed deadlines, incomplete assignments, and lower grades than they could have attained. In order to make sure this doesn't happen, there are a few simple strategies that any student can use to maximize their productivity while studying. First of all, creating a schedule is essential for good time management. It should be made the night before or at least the morning of the day ahead so that you know exactly what tasks need doing each day and when they need completing by. This will allow you to plan your study sessions around other activities accordingly without feeling overwhelmed or having too little time each day for everything that needs done. Another tip for effective time management is removing distractions from your workspace or study area such as phones and music players as these can easily draw away attention from working successfully on an assignment or studying for a test. Disabling notifications on social media apps may also help since one notification can often lead down a rabbit hole of procrastination - leaving much less done than anticipated!. Lastly but certainly not least important is taking regular breaks throughout long periods of work which helps refresh both mind and body allowing us to stay focused longer instead of burning out quickly over extended hours spent at our desks alone!. . . Overall while it seems like quite a daunting task at first glance – proper time management is something anyone can master with practice; making sure we get good rest along with staying organized every step in-between leads us towards better results academically & professionally alike no matter what field we end up pursuing after our schooling years come to an end!",1
"Fashion is a form of self-expression that has been around for centuries, but in recent years the fashion industry has been revolutionized. With the growth of technology and the internet, trends have become easier to create and access. Social media platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest have had a huge impact on how people express their sense of style. For Millennials and Gen Zers, fashion is becoming more than just clothing; it’s an expression of personal identity. This generation wants to make statements with their apparel choices while still being comfortable in what they wear—which explains why athleisurewear is having its moment right now. From yoga pants and hoodies to slip-on sneakers, trendy streetwear offers comfort while still looking chic. The popularity of loungewear also reflects this desire for practical yet stylish clothes that can go from morning coffee run to night out on the town without missing a beat (or changing outfits). In addition to traditional shopping outlets like department stores or boutiques, thrifting has also seen resurgence among young adults who want unique pieces without spending too much money or contributing to fast fashion companies who are often criticized for unethical production practices . There are many online secondhand shops popping up that specialize in vintage finds from brands like Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger which allow consumers be fashionable without sacrificing good taste over budget constraints or ecological concerns about sustainability . The digital age continues to change the fashion landscape by giving users access not onlyto various styles but also tools like Fashion Fits Me—an app which allows customers try clothing items virtually before purchasing them online – so buyers don't have worry whether something will fit when ordering off websites anymore!

"The challenge if exploring venus is that you can learn alot of stuff. Like while venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth , it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely , Or maybe we should think of them as challenges as all in one team or group. Now each previous mission was unmanned, and fro good reason,since, no spacecraft survived the landing fro more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explain's why not a singel spaceship has touched down on venus un more than three decades. And numerous factore contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite it's promity to us.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuic acid in venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, Temperature's average over 800 degree's fahrenheit, And the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on own planet now you really have to study this stuff so you can know about it. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. theses devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in teh 1940s during world war ll .

Not easy conditions, but survivable fro humans. However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photograpy and videography ineffective. Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anythign else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to condut a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

My conclusion is thats you need to star doing research on the earth in where yall stay at and things about the world that you do not know about , Or go out on trips in see new things or meeet new people . If you explore the world you will get to do these things or research is good it give you alot of information.",0
"Traveling beyong Earth shouldn't be be restricted by the the dangers and doubts, but should be thouroughly thought about, expanded on, and innovated on. Being bound by thoughts will lilmit our satisfacation of curiosities of humanity being met. Not only should we meet the challenge of travelling to Venus, but exceed at it.

NASA is working on mehcanical parts and electronics that will be resistent to the dense pressure, heat, and other forces of Venus's surface. NASA is also thinking of vehicles that will make it possible to withstand the hostile conditions of Venus. Though they may have limited insight of the on ground conditions, the scientist will be be able to study what they can. Although this may be a challenge to them, they are innovating everyday to allow our machines to withstand and last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

There are dangers along the way such as the extreme temperatures, the acidic atmosphere, and high pressure. But scientist are trying to make it possible for success of making equipment that will last through all of those hazords on Venus. Even with the problems along the way, scientist still work on ways to reach Venus beacuse it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago it most likely covered by oceans and was able to support life.

In conclusion, figuring out a way to reach and study Venus for a long time period is worth the risk of failure. We will learn from our mistakes and study the conditions of the planet more to make it possible to actaullly be able to study and retrieve results from the planet surface.",0
"Football fandom is an intense passion that runs deep. It’s a shared experience among fans of teams across all leagues and countries, one that can bring people together in support of a common cause. For many football fans, it’s more than just a game; it's an emotional connection to the team they love, and even beyond that – something to be celebrated with friends, family and strangers alike. The history of football dates back centuries ago when the sport was first popularized in England during the 19th century. Many changes have occurred since then but the basic elements remained intact: two sides facing off against one another for glory (and sometimes bragging rights) on field or pitch marked out by lines indicating each side's territory. As the years passed, soccer spread around the world becoming hugely popular in Europe, South America and eventually North America as well where it has become almost synonymous with American culture today. For those who are new to football fandom or “soccer” as some Americans call it – there are plenty opportunities for newcomers to get involved. Within most leagues there is an array of fan clubs which offer activities such as match-viewings at local pubs or bars; attending games together; arranging travel packages for away fixtures; organizing gatherings between rival supporters before major matches; and much more besides these things! Becoming part of your team’s fan club allows you access not only into exclusive maneuvers like these but also exclusive discounts on merchandise related to your favorite club including tickets to important games or perhaps even getting discounted prices from sponsors associated with them too!. In any case though - whether you're simply watching from home or going along en route day trips abroad - what matters is showing pride for your team however possible through chants songs flags banners t-shirt slogans etcetera. Football offers so much potential enjoyment especially when surrounded by fellow supporters who share similar enthusiasm levels because being part of this collective brings forth camaraderie",1
"Dear Senator,

I am a student in grade 8 and I am writing to you to express my concern about the Electoral College. I strongly believe that we need to change the way we elect our President.

The Electoral College was created in Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, and it was designed to give small states a voice in the election of the President. However, times have changed, and the Electoral College is no longer serving its intended purpose.

In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College. This is not fair, and it is not democratic. The person who wins the most votes should be the winner, not the person who wins the most states.

The Electoral College also discourages voter turnout. People who live in states that are strongly Democratic or Republican often feel like their vote doesn't matter, and they don't bother to vote. This is not good for our democracy, and it is not fair to the voters.

I understand that some people argue that the Electoral College is necessary to protect the interests of small states. However, I believe that this argument is flawed. Small states already have an advantage in the Senate, where each state has two Senators, regardless of size. We do not need another system that gives small states an unfair advantage.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the abolition of the Electoral College and the adoption of a popular vote system for the election of the President. This will ensure that every vote counts, and it will make our democracy stronger and more fair.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

"In today's fast-paced world, people often find themselves in situations where they have to make decisions quickly. While it might seem like a good idea to take action immediately, it is important to stop and think about the possible consequences of our actions. In my opinion, I strongly agree that people should take the time to think before they act, as this can help them avoid making hasty decisions that could have negative consequences.

One of the main reasons why people should stop and think before they act is that it can help them make better decisions. When we are under pressure to make a decision quickly, we often rely on our instincts or emotions, rather than our rational thinking. This can lead to impulsive decisions that we might regret later. However, if we take the time to calm down, weigh our options, and consider the possible outcomes of each one, we are more likely to make a wise decision that we can be happy with.

Another reason why people should stop and think before they act is that it can help them avoid making mistakes. When we act impulsively, we often overlook important details or fail to consider all the possible outcomes of our actions. This can lead to unintended consequences that can be difficult to reverse. However, if we take the time to carefully consider our options, we are more likely to notice potential problems or pitfalls and avoid them before they become major issues.

For example, imagine you are in a restaurant and you see a group of people arguing loudly at a nearby table. Your instinct might be to intervene and try to calm them down, but this could lead to a physical altercation or even legal trouble. However, if you take a moment to think, you might realize that it would be better to discreetly inform the restaurant staff or call the police, rather than trying to handle the situation on your own.

In addition, taking the time to think before we act can help us avoid making decisions that go against our values or beliefs. When we act impulsively, we might be more likely to make choices that we later regret or that we know are not in line with our personal values. However, if we take the time to reflect on our values and consider how our actions might affect others, we can make choices that are more aligned with our principles.

For example, imagine you are offered a job that pays very well, but you strongly disagree with the company's business practices. Your instinct might be to accept the job, since it offers a high salary, but if you stop to think about your values, you might realize that it would be better to decline the offer and look for a job that is more aligned with your beliefs.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that people should take the time to think before they act, as this can help them make better decisions, avoid making mistakes, and stay true to their values. While it might be tempting to act quickly in certain situations, it is important to remember that our actions can have far-reaching consequences, and taking just a few extra moments to reflect on our choices can make all the difference.",1
"Having a good attitude can have profoundly positive effects on your life and your success. Researchers have found that people who display a positive attitude reap many benefits beyond just having a better outlook on life. In addition to making you more resilient in the face of adversity, a good attitude provides other internal benefits such as improved self-confidence and better mental and emotional resilience.

In an organizational context, having a good attitude can also help you get ahead. Employers often look for candidates who bring a sense of positive energy to their job. Having a good attitude and willingness to work hard can make you a more desirable candidate in the job market.

Likewise, research has shown that having a good attitude can promote stronger and more lasting relationships. People tend to be drawn to those who are optimistic and have a good attitude, as it helps create a more enjoyable atmosphere and avoids unnecessary conflicts.

There are numerous examples of well known people who have experienced success in life despite having a disagreeable attitude. However, it is important to remember that attitude is essential in accomplishing goals and striving for success. Having a good attitude can mean getting things easier and achieving a higher level of success. It is important to remember that attitude is something you can train yourself to have, and it can take time to shift your outlook and begin seeing the world in a more positive light.",1
"Venus is a rather intriguing planet that mankind would have a great interest in studying. Venus' great danger is what's stopping us from examining it up close. The author tries to say that overcoming this danger is worth dealing with to explore Venus, however. I believe their claim is valid and that there is value of trying to study the planet, even with these dangerous conditions. There's even a decent chance of working around the risks. The author uses reasons like it's the most Earth-like planet, studying Venus from a ship orbiting around the planet isn't insightful enough to learn much, and that NASA is even coming up with different methods of studying the planet to justify their idea.

There's a lot of evidence to suggest that Venus was originally similar to Earth in quite a few ways. The planet was likely covered with oceans that could've been able to support life. Venus also had other features like rocky sediment, craters, valleys, and mountains. Venus is also sometimes the closest planet to Earth, often swapping back and forth with Mars being the closest. This evidence shows that it's likely Venus was essentially an alternate version of Earth.

It's also a good point that hovering above the planet and observing it just isn't effective enough at gathering information. Since the atmosphere is impenetrable to light, photography and videography of the surface is near pointless. The inability to go down to the ground and collect samples of the materials, substances, and gases hinders our ability to understand the planet. Researchers are even considering innovating space technology to allow us to gather some form of meaningful knowledge. We need to advance past observing from an orbital space station and find a way to get down there.

NASA realizes that problems could be solved with the right approach. They've tested how long some electronics made of silicon carbide could survive in Venus' conditions and so far, the results have shown that there is potential. Building resistant computers may also collect information on the planet, but mechanical computers may get this job done the best. Mechanical computers were used in World War II, but they were sturdier than modern computers and don't require any electronics to function. If one method of getting closer to the planet doesn't work, we could always try again with another.

Overcoming the dangers of Venus is currently one of the toughest challenges of space exploration we've seen yet. With enough determination and patience though, we can find a way to work around this dilemma; especially since NASA clearly hasn't given up working on solutions. This may be necessary too; our current method of studying this place just isn't that good. The reward may be worth the effort too since Venus is one of the most interesting planets we've attempted exploring. Let's just hope that this won't stop us from wanting discover the whole universe.",0
"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or replaced with a popular vote system for the president of the United States. As a high school student, I have had the opportunity to learn about the pros and cons of both systems and have formed a strong opinion on the matter.

Firstly, I believe that the Electoral College has served its purpose well throughout history, ensuring that smaller states have a voice in the election process. As stated in the article The Electoral College: A 20th Century Anachronism? by Jeffrey B. Mullins, the Electoral College was established to balance the power between large and small states (Mullins). Without the Electoral College, larger states with a larger population would have a disproportionate amount of power in the election process, leaving smaller states with little to no influence. This would be unfair to the citizens of those smaller states, who would essentially have no say in who becomes the next president.

However, I also understand the argument that the Electoral College can sometimes lead to a situation where the winner of the popular vote does not win the presidency. This has happened five times in U.S. history, including in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. As the article The Electoral College: A 20th Century Anachronism? states, in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton received nearly 3 million more votes than Donald Trump, but lost the Electoral College vote by a wide margin (Mullins). This can lead to questions about the fairness of the system and whether it truly represents the will of the people.

Despite these concerns, I believe that the Electoral College still has value and should not be abolished. Instead, I suggest considering a compromise between the two systems. One possible solution is to have a mixed system, where some states use the popular vote to allocate their electoral votes, while others use the Electoral College system. This would allow for a more representative system, where both large and small states have a voice, while also ensuring that the president is elected by a majority of the population.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the value of the Electoral College and the importance of ensuring that all citizens have a voice in the election process. While there are certainly arguments to be made for a popular vote system, I believe that a mixed system would be the best solution. Thank you for your time and consideration.

"In today's world, self-care is becoming increasingly important for maintaining both mental and physical health. Self-care activities can range from something as simple as taking a few minutes each day to read a book or listen to music, all the way up to larger scale practices such as going on vacation or attending a yoga class. One self-care practice that has been gaining traction in recent years is journaling - specifically keeping an emotional journal. An emotional journal allows you to write down your thoughts and feelings about any given situation - whether it is positive, negative, neutral or somewhere in between. It can be used as both a tool of reflection and of catharsis; giving yourself an opportunity to express what may not be appropriate (or safe) to communicate aloud with other people. Writing out your emotions can provide you with clarity over what’s really bothering you if there are so many different feelings swirling around inside at once; it also offers perspective for how those same issues may have come about in the first place – allowing yourself some time for introspection without judgement from anyone else. A key component of using an emotional journal effectively lies within its structure: providing enough detail when necessary but also being brief if needed too – noting down even small details like body language and tone of voice which cannot necessarily be conveyed through writing alone can greatly help better understanding situations afterwards when looking back upon them. An effective approach could involve following a basic template each time – ask yourself “what happened?” followed by “how did I feel?” and finally “why do I think this made me feel this way?” Acknowledging our own emotions within this context helps us learn how best we react when faced with similar circumstances again in future life experiences; partaking regularly in these types of activities will allow greater insight into ourselves overall as well through increased observation skills regarding our behaviours both internally generated ones along with external influences such as environmental factors etcetera",1
"Venus is rather uninhabitable, or is it?

Although dangerous, one would not say uninhabitable, as that implies it is impossible. the author of The Challenge of Exploring Venus Discusses how it is perfectly plausible, and even worth it! That is, only if we have the correct equipment to do so.

Now while there are dangers, such as sulfiric acid clouds, metal melting heat, earthquakes, lightning strikes, volcanoes, and the mechanism shattering atmospheric pressure (Paragraph 3), you may ask Why go through the trouble if the conditions are so horrible?. The reason is that it was so much like earth long ago, oceans and rock formations, even theoretical life!

NASA is helping with this idea via brainstorming for ideas to study venus, the first is to hover above it, avoiding all the surface problems, and still being close. The only issue, as provided by the author, wouldnt work, because while they would be in the air, the clouds would be too thick to allow anything, thus rendering the idea useless.

Another NASA idea is to use different electronics, like simpler models, and having them TAILORED for venus, such models lasted up to 3 weeks even! If those do not work, instead of moving foreward in our electronics, NASA would move back, back to the 1940s with mechanical computers, levers and gears computing what a normal computer could quicker and better, but while the mechanical option is slower, it is MUCH more durable.

With all of these ideas, I feel the author did an outstanding job supports this idea, and I support it whole-heartedly, it may be possible in the coming years, as our technology rapidly evolves, so do we, what do you think?",0
"It is no secret that recycling plays an important role in preserving the planet. Not only does it help to reduce our carbon footprint, but it also provides a much-needed boost to the economy. This essay will explore why recycling should be embraced by everyone, and how to make it part of your everyday lifestyle. At its core, recycling helps us create a sustainable environment for future generations. By reusing materials such as glass bottles, aluminum cans and plastics containers we are able to significantly reduce the amount of trash that is sent off into landfills or incinerated every year. What's more, items like paper goods can be recycled multiple times with minimal loss in quality - saving trees along the way! Additionally, energy usage is reduced when goods are reused because they don't need to go through production processes again; this means less pollution too!. In terms of economic benefits, companies who incorporate sustainability practices into their operations stand out from competitors who do not practice them at all. Recycling both conserves resources and creates jobs – think about all those people sorting through collections or manning curbside pickups! Also keep in mind how businesses benefit when consumers choose products made from recycled materials since these cost significantly less than newly manufactured ones. Finally, there’s also tax incentives available for individuals and businesses that take part in green initiatives around waste management systems like composting or reuse programs like donation centers for secondhand clothing items – something everyone should consider taking advantage of if applicable!. The simplest way to start living a life full of sustainability practices is by incorporating small changes into your daily routine at home or work - recycle what you can whenever possible: separate bins for organic/non-recyclable material should become habit; find alternative uses for old materials before throwing them away; purchase items made from post consumer content (check labels!) And finally - educate yourself on new developments related to eco-friendly consumption patterns so you can stay ahead & contribute positively towards",1
"In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus author talks about how studying Venus is worth the trouble. One reason the auther might think this is because Venus is so much like earth it was even nicknaned Earths twin.

People belive that Venus is like earth because they are close to the same sice and they are close toghther in our solar system. The author states that Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. also the author states that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.

"Dear state senator,

I believe that we should keep the Electoral College. It's a part of history and has worked for many years. There maybe people that think the Electoral College should be taken out and be replaced, but I strongly disagree.

The Electoral College was founded by our founding fathers, and it's in the Constitution. This system has worked for years and it still works to this day. When the people vote they are voting for a slate of electors, and those electors are trusted people. If you don't like the system than you don't have to vote, but you want to vote top help your electors when.

Changing the election by popular vote for the presendent won't change anything. People will find mistakes in that and want a different way to elect people. It's best to leave the system alone before everything goes havoc.  The Electoral College is a way for people to vote for who they wan't without others knowing. Keeping the Electoral College may make some people mad, but it's something we are all used to. It would take years for us to perfect everythimg for a new voting system.

That's why I think we should Keep the Electoral College. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Sincerely,

A concerened citizen.",0

    The proverb “Honesty is the best policy” is often viewed as an ideal for how we should behave. Honesty implies a commitment to telling the truth, no matter the consequences. While being honest can sometimes lead to hurt feelings or a loss of trust, it can also create positive benefits in multiple areas. On the other hand, dishonesty often carries negative repercussions because it involves stealing, cheating, lying, and hiding important facts. To summarize, being honest is always preferable to dishonesty. In every situation, it is best to remain truthful, even if it means navigating difficult conversations or enduring lasting damage to a relationship.",1
"Imagine this, Living in a world where pollution no longer exists, where cars have been limiting due to important reasons and where stress no longer affects individuals that drive. Cars have played indeed an important role in our lives since a long time. They do make us get to places faster but they are also making some individuals more lazier than before. They have affected our atmosphere which can affect every living organisms on Earth in the nonfar future. In my opinion cars should not be limited, the companies that make them should just change the way they work.

First of all, less and less people no longer walk or take public transportation in places where every individual in the population owns a car. According to source number 1 paragraph 3 When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. This is important because it shows that when individuals own a car they are always going to fight against state laws, traffic, people on the streets, meaning that they are always going to stress everytime they ride their car. This could be a lot different if cars were limited for every single individual or if cars somehow where seperated from people's places for walking.

Second of all, our planet's atmosphere has gotten more and more polluted than when cars were not a big thing to people. Pollution is something that some people do not take seriously. It can affect our lives in a big way. According to source number 2 pargraph 1 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drivin ban to clear the air of the global city meaning that the air was being contaminated due to cars. This is important because cars are affecting our atmosphere in a way that can affect us all by destroying our atmosphere and leaving every living organism on Earht with no oxygen.

Last but not least, Scientist's have invented cars that are electric meaning that they dont use gasoline. This is a good thing, because it can reduce pollution for a better atmosphere. Another way that pollution can be reduced is by making more and more individuals use public transportation. This can help by them not using their gasoline powered cars that pollute the air. In conclusion, cars will not be limited in the near future they will just change the way they work.",0
"The technolology to scan your face and tell your emotions is kind of creepy. Having a machine in class to tell teachers how the students are feelling is just a little weird to me but it also could be very usefull. In the text it states that the software in the computer could see if you are confused and will change the lesson so the student will better understand.

The main reason why this is creepy to me is it reminds me of the Movie Tremator. In the movie Arnald Swartsnager comes back to the past to protect the future leader of the human rebelian aginst the superior robots they have built. Well to make a long story short the robot that Arnald Swartsnager plays can scan Robert Oconner's face and asked him why is your face leaking. Yes I know this technology is far more advanced than the movie ,but that is how I can relate.

I can also relate to how the computer could tell if you are confused and change the lesson so you can learn the way you do. In the text it states the computer can tell if you have a fake or forced smile or a guinine smile by the rincles under your eyes. The text also said you can probly tell what mood your friend is by the look on their face,but the person could be hiding their true emotions from you so the computer can tell if you are mad at that person at that time and place.

In the story the author includes how most video games and surgery cames have non verbal comunications,and how your home computer could never process this information like how your feeling that day.

I personaly would like to have this technology in our classrooms,and our homes. This would help out alot of men. For an example its your one year weading anaversery and you ask your lovley wife what she wants to eat. A simple question,but you rember that she can never tell you where she wants to eat. Or the example your kids come home acting odd you ask what is wrong but you dont get a responce. So you go in to there school computer and watch what mood he or she is in.

So I have told you my thoughts on the subject time to recap. I first thought it was odd and kinda scarry due to it reminding me of a movie and the robots. Then we relised that this technology can be great for the students who dont fo very well in school becaouse they do not get the lesson.",0
"In recent times, a debate has emerged on whether it is appropriate to tell the patient the truth about their cancer diagnosis in the Chinese culture. While telling the truth is a norm in the western world, it is not the case in China, where it is customary to avoid sharing the diagnosis with the patient. As the country continues to modernize, some people believe that this traditional practice must change. I wholeheartedly agree with this stance, and in this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion.

Firstly, honesty is a fundamental value that should always be upheld, irrespective of culture or geographical location. The patient has the right to know about their medical condition, as it concerns their life and wellbeing. In a sense, it is unethical to withhold the truth from a patient who may want to make informed decisions about their treatment and care. It is essential to provide the patient with accurate information that can help them understand the nature of the disease, it's prognosis, and treatment options.

Secondly, not telling the patient the truth can have long-term negative effects on the family's mental health. Keeping the diagnosis a secret can cause a tremendous amount of stress, anxiety, and guilt for family members who feel responsible for making decisions on behalf of the patient. Moreover, not disclosing the diagnosis can lead to feelings of resentment and mistrust from the patient if they ever find out. It can also create a sense of isolation and loneliness for the patient, as they are not allowed to share their thoughts or emotions with their loved ones.

Finally, the Chinese culture has evolved over time, and some traditional practices have become outdated. With the increasing influence of western values and practices, there is a growing awareness of the importance of transparency and honesty in medical care. Chinese medical professionals are now recognizing the need to inform patients about their diagnosis accurately. This change is evident in the increasing number of cancer patients who are now being informed about their condition in Chinese hospitals.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the traditional practice of not telling the patient the truth about their cancer diagnosis must change. It is essential to uphold the value of honesty and integrity in medical care, and the patient has the right to know about their medical condition. Not sharing the diagnosis can have adverse effects on the family's mental health and create feelings of mistrust and isolation for the patient. As the Chinese culture continues to evolve and modernize, it is imperative to embrace new values and practices that prioritize the patient's wellbeing.",1
"As I know the Music,Drama, and Art classes are not mandatory to take. the leaners at education area can take these classes for their choices. infact it is a elective not mandatory. so the leaners can take these subject as a elective. for example: if a student take an art class infact he/she is not take it as a required class he/she take it for their choice and wants to get extra credit. or if a person has 4 required classes and and he/she take a art class instead one of the 4 classes and he/she thaught this is the 4 classes that i need for graduation indeed they are going to take a wrong class because as we know the art classes is not needed for graduation. so we have to take a class that we needed for graduation.

Although some educator take the art or music classes off course seniors because they might be have less classes. in this case they choose these classes as choice and the junior can take these as well to get extra credit.

lets talk about the required classes:

require classes are: English11,geometery,math,CIS,world history,and etc...

these classes that students need to take it and complete the school credit and recived a better score for graduation.

each subject has different SOL test.

when the students reach to those classes they need to pass the SOL test as well as SOL is one of the important part of required classess that leaners need to pass it during a year. the SOL test comes twice for students off course!

they have to recived over 300 score which can allowed to take it again. so that is the required classes which is a student learn in a year.

although we have a electives classes such is Art,Drama Music and etc but we can not counted on required classes. So Art,Drama, and Music are not necessary to take it as required classes those should be electives that leaners can choose as favorate subject for their future.",0
"Excerpt:

The concept that people choose their own paths in life is one that has been widely discussed for centuries. Many people believe that we are responsible for forming our futures, while others feel that our lives are determined by external factors. There are various elements that need to be taken into consideration when discussing this topic. For example, the effects of relying on other people for decision making, the correlation between confidence and decision making, the difference between listening to others' opinions and making your own decisions, and how all of these factors can affect a person's path in life. All of these things are important to consider when attempting to analyze the idea that people choose their own paths in life.",1
"In an increasingly digital world, the importance of maintaining a sense of community cannot be overstated. The Internet may have brought us closer together in theory, but it was not built to nurture meaningful relationships. Social media and online forums can offer useful glimpses into our neighbors' lives, but they do not replace genuine human connection and physical interaction. Through cultivating a true sense of community by engaging with one another on a personal level, we are able to build trust and develop real friendships that make life richer and more fulfilling. Traditionally speaking, communities were formed around shared interests or geography; living close enough to someone allowed for regular contact that strengthens relationships over time. Today's technology makes it easy to stay connected even when actual physical distance exists between individuals—but this isn't always enough replace the need for face-to-face interactions as well as casual conversations about everyday topics like work stressors or weekend plans. For instance, attending local events is great way to meet potential friends who share similar passions or values: whether you're joining your neighborhood book club or taking part in a charity run fundraiser at a nearby park, getting out there is key!. In addition to creating bonds through shared activities, it's also important seek out ways foster meaningful dialogue among members of your small circle as well strangers alike—it could be something as simple asking somebody how their day went while waiting line at the grocery store checkout counter or having coffee with coworkers after work instead grabbing drinks directly from home (and going straight into Netflix mode). More importantly these moments strengthen ties within an existing social network helps introduce new people who might eventually become part of larger collective regardless if they live down street from you or across globe entirely!.

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Transition to Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the current Electoral College system or, alternatively, to explore the possibility of transitioning to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the viewpoints presented in multiple texts, I believe that both systems have their merits, and it is crucial to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each.

The current Electoral College system, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register (What Is the Electoral College?), provides a fair and reliable method for electing the President. Firstly, it ensures certainty of outcome by requiring the winning candidate to obtain a majority of electoral votes. This means that the elected President must have broad support from across the country, rather than relying solely on a popular vote plurality. Furthermore, the winner-take-all nature of most states' allocation of electors promotes the idea of everyone's President, as individuals from various regions have a say in the election outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner (In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President). By focusing their efforts in these states, candidates are compelled to address issues that may otherwise go overlooked. This ensures that a wider range of concerns are taken into account during the campaign and potentially in the governance of the country.

The Electoral College also protects the interests of smaller states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states can have their political weight balanced by the Electoral College. This allows candidates to give attention to the needs and concerns of citizens in these states, preventing the dominance of a few populous states over the others.

On the other hand, the argument put forth by Bradford Plumer (The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong) emphasizes the need for change. Plumer contends that the electoral college is unfair to voters, as candidates often prioritize swing states and neglect others. This leads to an imbalance of attention, where only a few states have a significant role in shaping the outcome of the election. However, it is important to recognize that this issue can be addressed by reforming the current system, such as implementing a proportional representation method like that practiced in Maine and Nebraska.

While some critics of the Electoral College, like Plumer and the Gallup poll respondents cited in his text, argue for its abolition in favor of a popular vote, we must consider the potential risks and complications involved. As Judge Posner points out, a direct popular vote could lead to a run-off election if no candidate receives a majority, which would significantly complicate the election process. Moreover, a popular vote system would require careful consideration to ensure that the voices and interests of smaller states are adequately represented and balanced against those of more populous states.

In conclusion, it is essential to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both the Electoral College and a direct popular vote system. While the Electoral College has its flaws, it provides a level of certainty, encourages a trans-regional appeal in candidates, promotes attention to swing states, allows for balanced representation of smaller states, and avoids run-off elections. However, reforms should be considered to address its shortcomings, such as implementing a proportional representation method and ensuring the needs of all citizens are taken into account.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of our state and the nation as a whole.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"When we show positive qualities such as kindness, empathy, and respect through our behavior and actions, we can have a powerful influence on the people around us. By modeling these qualities ourselves, we give others permission to do the same.  

For example, I remember growing up with my siblings. If I showed them respect, our interactions were much calmer and more constructive. This taught them to show respect to others and resulted in healthier relationships with our peers.  

Another example is volunteering in my local community. Through my actions, I am demonstrating how important it is to help others. This can inspire others to give back to their own community, benefiting society at large.

Ultimately, displaying positive qualities in our behavior and actions can have a ripple effect in our communities for the better. Through our action, we can have the power to shape the lives of those around us in profound ways.",1
"Dogs have long been a beloved companion for humans, providing unconditional love and support no matter the circumstance. It is easy to see why they are often referred to as man's best friend. As our understanding of canine psychology has deepened in recent years, research has shown that dogs can be an especially powerful tool in helping those suffering from mental health issues like depression and anxiety. This essay will explore how dogs can help improve mental health by providing companionship, physical exercise, and stress relief. For many people struggling with depression or anxiety, one of the main problems is feelings of loneliness and isolation. Dogs provide unconditional love and attention which helps to combat these feelings by giving someone a sense of connection with another living being who loves them unconditionally! Having a pet also provides structure - walking the dog twice daily encourages regular activity that gives the person something positive to focus on during low moments while at home there’s always someone needing your attention so you don’t dwell too much on negative thoughts or emotions. The physical exercise involved in caring for a dog not only improves physical health but it can also have incredibly positive effects on mental wellbeing too! Studies show that regular walks increase levels of serotonin – aka ‘the happy hormone’ – which helps regulate moods; reduce cortisol – aka 'the stress hormone' - which is linked with feeling overwhelmed; plus increases feel-good hormones oxytocin (affection) and endorphins (pleasure). Walking your pup might even become part of your own self-care routine if you find yourself able make time for it each day. . Having a furry companion around us can also work wonders when it comes reducing stress levels when life feels overwhelming. Just being near them can lower blood pressure due to its calming effect on our nervous system as well as releasing dopamine into our brains, creating an overall sense of peace & tranquility throughout any given moment regardless of what else may be going on in life!",1
"Do you thing that most danger of us lies not setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark? Sometimes is not good to tell others what you want because some of them may not want good things for you to get or have, you want to not used too much you phone, you want to loose some weight, and you want to graduated from high school.

Today in day many people used their phone a lot and sometimes they don't do things because they spend most of their time on their phones. For example, you get home from school and you have to do some homework, but you don't want to do it yet because you just got home from school, and you tell your self that you will relax for a few hours, and then you will start to do your homework. You ate dinner and everything you go to your room and one of your friends ask you if you want to play videos game? you tell your self I will play a little bit and then I will start to do my homework. Two hours pass by and you are still playing videos games. You tell your friend I must stop playing because I have to start doing my homework and your friend tells you don't go, we ask someone to give us copy, and you say yes, because you want to continue do keep playing. When you get to school you don't have any body to ask to give you copy. It was your choice to keep playing. That day you make a plant you put a timer and when that timer stop you will stop doing what you are doing. It work because when you time your self you can do more than one thing, you could also have more time to just play but the good thing is you have finish all you things.

For new year resolution you say that you will loose some weight this year. Your family laugh at you because you had said that almost every year and you have not do it. Sometimes is good to just tell your self to do things and don't tell anyone because some people don't want others to get things because they want to get it first and if they don't get it. Those kind of people don't want others do get it also. If you want to loose weight just do it and don't tell any body because you don't know what others want for you. It's better to do things in secret because at the end you are the one you are doing it and no body is helping you. The things that you do are for you not for everyone. When you have your things you can tell to your closer people and some of them may be happy for you and some may not, but that doesn't have to worry you because you have already do your thing and they can't do nothing to take that away from you. Your family may see you that you say things but you don't do it. You have to show them that you can do things that you say. You may feel sad because of what people say and you just have that in your mint. That is why not good to tell everyone of what you want to do because they may be jealous and they don't want you to be in a very good shape. Just go and workout and when they see you again they will say wow you look different what did you did to look great; they will not see you as a lair because you show them that you can do things. It can take time to see the different but you are doing it.

When you are in school you will have friends that are good for you and also those that are not. When you are in high school you want to pass all your classes so you can make your parents proud and they can be happy; but their will be some friends that will tell you to go out and have fun etc. In school their will be students that care about classes and their will be that they don't care. You want to be with those friends that help each other to have good grades. Their will be friends that don't like you and want to get you in some trouble, and they will want you to don't have good grade and be like them. You want to be with friends that support each other. Also you don't want to be that kind of person that say you have good grade and you don't have those good grades and you just are copying others and when it's test time you don't know what to do because you didn't do the work by your self. To get things that you want; you have to work for it. It's better to have friends that help each other and that also that help you to do your work and can be easy for you to also help others.

People may disagree with this because they have good people around them and that they help each other. They may say this because they haven't go through things like; one of your friends don't like you and they don't want you to have the things you want. Sometimes is better to do things and don't tell everyone because you don't know what people really want for you or what they think of the things you want. In this world are people that they don't care what you, they will agreed with what you do and if you felt they always be with you, their is those that they don't want you and others to be happy. The best thing to do is just do things and when you have it tell to everyone that you want because when you already have it they can just talk bad things of you and you don't stay in front of them as a looser because you didn't they don't know how you did it. Us human been we always have the thing inside of us that always make us jealous for what others have. For example, If one of your friends have a news phone you will get a little bit jealous because you also want to have that phone. Every single person in this world has when through that. That's why people don't trust each others.

It's better to do things that no body know because if you felt or don't get what you want, their will not be people that knew. You didn't get it and they will not be talking bad things of you or look at you as a looser that you can't do anything. You will be the only one that will know and if you want to tell them you can it will be your choice. You want to do things because you want to be proud of yourself and that is the only thing it counts.",0
"Michelangelo the artist once said,

'' The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving mark.'' I agree with michelangelo statement because we want to aim our goal right, or we will ending up missing. However, there can be a better statement to explain this more. When people want to achieve their goal to be somone in life. It's like shotting a arrow to hit the middle, and aiming the goal we want. For example, to aim it at the middle you have to focus, believe, think, be positive, and let go of your arrow to aim your goal. Other people would like a better statement , and also a better example to go with it. There are mostly people that take it serious to aim for their goal to be success. However there are some other that don't really care and just try to aim for their goal, and ending up missing their shot towards the middle. Another example, is when people want to aim their goal they have to study , work hard, have faith, believe , take risk , be proud, and never giving up. But there's people that miss their one shot towards the middle. Because they are lazy, not prepared, not focus, negative, not giving effort, and not paying attention for what goal their aiming for , so basically they will end up missing their only shot. Third example, is people have to aim their goal just right not to high , and to low. The goal is to aim in the middle ,but Micheangelo is right in one part because you only have one arrow to make it th the middle. It's mostly saying you have one shot to aim for your goal without making any miskates. I could understand why Michelangelo said '' The greater danger for most of us is aming our goal target right in one shot.'' Because there are some people that would have to take some risks. For example, they are not a citizen , or they don't have any papers to work , don't understand english well, they have to leave love ones behind,

and get discriminated by their colors. And it makes it more difficult for some people to aim for their goal. For those reasons theirs fewest people's that end up missing there shot. But there are other people's that won't let this get in their way by taking the risk , and some of those risks come worth it at the end. For example , there are some people that get discriminated by how they look and their color ,but doesn't mean that they have to give up ,and point their arrow the wrong direction to miss their shoot to success. They have to show the others people that they can make their one shot towards the middle all because they study, work hard, put effort, being prepared, being positive and never giving up. These are my supporting details ,and reasons why i agree with Michelangelo the artist statement. However, I don't think that this is statement is the most greatest danger for all of us. For sure there's others statement that are more dangerous then this one.",0
"For those looking to be successful in multiple careers, research is essential. It takes a lot of effort to learn the skills needed and stay on top of ever-changing trends within each industry. In addition to research, a practical way to gain the necessary skills is to try a recipe or activity that you have never done before and practice it to perfect your skills. 

Experimenting with new things can often increase our self-confidence because we gain a sense of accomplishment in learning something new. Exploring and learning new activities can also help increase our knowledge and grow our skill sets. Additionally, failure can be seen as a learning opportunity, where we can take something away from the experience, while gaining the confidence to attempt such endeavours again. 

By studying the experiences of someone with multiple careers, it is possible to take away valuable information on how they managed to move between each different career and succeed. This knowledge can then be used to develop and form our own career plan. Nevertheless, it is essential to remember the importance of research and the willingness to experience something new in order to be successful in multiple careers.",1
"Phones and driving

Usi5ng your phone while driving is very dangerous because a lot of people die because of texting and driving. Especially a lot of teenagers who drive use social media while they're driving.

Which is one of the main cause for so many deaths not only in teens but in adults.

As social media continues to progress and now that everything is on the Internet texting and driving isn't the main issue. The main issue is that there is nothing that is stopping people from being on their phones in general. Phones in general are a big distraction and especially while driving. People will tend to look at emails, check social media, or just simply send a text message while they are at stop sign but that can be just as dangerous as well because as the driver hits the gas they are looking at their phones at the same time and then boom that's wen the big accident happens. This is a very common thing that happens with a lot of people who aren't careful enough to put their phones down and pay attention to the road.

A lot like drinking and driving many teens they can get away with texting and driving, but what they don't know is that being behind the wheel and looking at your screen at the same time is a dangerous. While recording yourself behind the wheel is another mistake waiting to happen.",0
"Climate change is an increasingly serious issue that needs urgent attention. The effects of climate change are wide-reaching, from rising sea levels and extreme weather events to droughts and food shortages. It is a global problem with potentially catastrophic consequences for humanity if left unchecked. The Earth's atmosphere has been changing since the industrial revolution due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels that release pollutants into the air. These pollutants trap heat in our planet’s environment, causing a phenomenon known as the 'greenhouse effect', which leads to global warming. Since then, average temperatures have steadily risen throughout the world, leading to extreme weather events occurring more frequently than before. In addition, melting ice caps cause rising ocean levels which threaten coastal communities around the world and can lead to devastating flooding in low lying regions. Humans must take responsibility for this crisis by reducing carbon emissions through personal lifestyle changes like using public transport instead of driving or cutting down on meat consumption by adopting flexitarian diets . Governments also have an important role to play in encouraging sustainable practices through regulations and incentives such as subsidies for renewable energy sources like solar power or wind turbines . Furthermore , there should be international cooperation between countries so that all nations work together towards achieving zero net emissions globally by 2050 . In conclusion , it is clear that we must act quickly if we want to prevent further damage caused by climate change . We need individuals , businesses , governments and international organisations alike all working towards tackling this serious environmental problem . Only then will we be able create a brighter future for generations yet unborn who may one day experience its full extent if nothing else is done now .",1
"When I had a car, I was always tense, Heidrun Walter said in the article, 'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars', in the New York Times, I'm much happier this way. In Vauban, Germany, people do not use cars. They find other means of transportation, such as biking and walking. In Bogota, the construction of bicycle paths has made 118 miles of passages for residents. According to David Goldberg, All our development since World War II has been centered around the car. While that is not entirely true, it does have a good point. We should move on from the all-powerful box with wheels.

One major reason for not using cars is pollution. As most of us know, pollution is bad for the environment, and for most life on Earth. Unfortunately, our use of cars and power plants is generating pollution faster then plants can take it out of the atmosphere. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, Elisabeth Rosenthal said. In the article, Paris bans driving due to smog, 60% of drivers in Paris stopped after five days of intensifying smog. That means that the smog was dense enough to where it was dangerous for drivers to go anywhere.

The article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota mentions that: The turnout [for car-free day] was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. Why would people continue to participate in car-free day if they hated it so much? Despite the fine of $25, it really isn't a big deal. One of the participants, Carlos Arturo Plaza, said, It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

Now, how can you simply stop driving? You need to get to your job! Nobody is telling you to move to Vauban. However, biking or walking to the park could help. You don't need a car to go to your neighbor's house. They're right next door. Of course, not using cars is not going to stop the pollution from power plants, but it will certainly slow down how fast it is going into the atmosphere.

We simply can't allow pollution to go where it is going. If we all stop relying on cars to get us to places, we will have enough time to think of an easier solution. Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. There is a chance that being car-free won't be as bad as everyone thinks. It might even be enjoyable. There is also a chance that it will despised. We'll only know if we try it, now won't we?",0
"The effects of climate change on coral reefs are a pressing environmental concern. Coral reefs are vital to the health of global ecosystems, providing countless benefits that include shoreline protection, carbon sequestration and habitat for marine life. Unfortunately, their existence is now threatened due to the unavoidable consequences of human-induced climate change. For thousands of years, coral reefs have been a natural resource essential for sustaining oceanic life. They protect coastlines from storms and tsunamis through breakwater formation, serve as nurseries for juvenile fish species, provide food sources in some parts of the world and act as important tourist attractions by hosting an abundance of sea creatures ranging from colorful tropical fish to giant sharks. Their decline endangers both local communities and international economies alike who rely heavily on them for income via tourism or fishing industries; but most importantly it contributes significantly towards accelerating global warming which has grave implications across all life forms around the world. Due to rising temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions trapping more heat energy within our atmosphere each year, ocean waters absorb more warmth than before leading to catastrophic levels of acidification which cause irreparable damage on delicate reef systems worldwide—a process called ‘coral bleaching’. Bleached corals appear white when they expel algae living inside them because with increased acidity in surrounding seawater they can no longer survive; while this might not seem like such a big deal at first glance, these animals play an incredibly important role in maintaining healthy balance between different aquatic organisms thus causing devastating ripple effects if gone extinct or severely depleted in number due extreme environmental conditions created by human actions over time despite numerous warnings about its potential harms going unheeded (in terms lack collective awareness/political will among general populations). Exacerbated weather events including stronger hurricanes also contribute indirectly towards this trend since high winds stir up sedimentary debris clouding nearby waters reducing sunlight penetration ultimately starving coral colonies off much needed nutrition required sustain themselves throughout seasons—another consequence brought forth thanks",1
"What are the benefits of working with a group vs working alone. Working alone isn't bad because their no one to rely on. Then and working with a group is more beneficial. reasons being said are more people more ideas, getting help from teammates, and will be less mistake because there more than one person to get help. For example playing in a team sport working with teammates is better than trying to do every thing alone, same thing with a big project.

Just like the saying two heads are better than one. defiantly when working on a project. Being alone there going to be mistake because no one will correct you on the paper. Another benefits of working in a group is more ideas coming from different people and taking that you can learn from it. Not only that if a person is stuck on something the group with help out to solve it together, also it will save a lots of time trying to work by yourself.

Being in a team that the PE teacher assign you, will be hard trying to play alone in a group or team. Working by your self is not helping the team or people skills. In the long run getting a job there will be times when needed to work with co workers or bosses, doing group projects or playing for a team will benefit that. Because it helping on people skill. That learning in experience knowing not everybody is the same.

Working alone helps but I feel in a group is more beneficial. There no motivation being alone it attend to be boring. Therefor more mistakes could happen, limit to some ideas and knowledge, and can't get help because every one is working alone. Doing work in a group helps students be wake, reasons for that is there someone to talk to also it will be less work and save good amount of time. Students attend to dose off or stress when it to much work on their hands.

In conclusion I prefer working in a group feel more beneficial then working alone. It will defiantly help in school if a student is doing a project or playing for a team. Also in the long run With jobs, family, neighbors, or starting a protest will help if being in a group.",0
"First impressions can have an immense effect on the success of relationships, both personal and professional. People often make assumptions based on first impressions, whether it's a job applicant's clothing or the body language of a person they're meeting for the first time. Positive first impressions can lead to further conversations that help foster strong relationships and lay the groundwork for successful interactions in the future. An example of a positive first impression is when two co-workers initially meet and find common ground by sharing an interest in a certain hobby or activity. On the other hand, negative first impressions can lead to misunderstandings that can damage relationships before they even have the chance to begin. An example of a negative first impression could be when two people are meeting for the first time and one seems uninterested in what the other is saying, coming off as disinterested or rude. While first impressions may not always be accurate, they can have a lasting impact and it is important to be mindful of how we present ourselves to others in order to create a positive impression.",1
"We all know there are 7 wonders of the world, but could this be the first wonder of the universe. Nature can make some astonishing things. Many things in the world, or even the universe, are nature-made. They have been here since the beginning of time even though they seem to be man-made. The Face should be included in this category. This Face was created by natural processes.

Similar to the Face, places on Earth are nature-made. Even though sand dunes on beaches are kept by humans, they were first nature-made. Sand storms on Earth create higher dunes in deserts because the starting dune blocks the sand from getting across it. This may be what caused the Face to be created. There may have been an oval shaped dune at that spot, and, then, a storm passed by. The beginning dune blocked the Mars sand from exceeding that barrier, and the Face we see now was created. The shadows forming the eyes, nose and mouth were created on accident.

Sometimes landforms are created when objects collide with planets. The Face could have been formed when a meteor crashed into Mars. Only this time the crash did not create a crater, but instead a protruding object that over the years got rounded out by storms. Evidence does not suggest that every single meteor strike causes a crater. The reason that craters are an effect on Earth may be due to Earth's atmosphere or it's magnetic field. This may just be the first time NASA has ever seen a mound created by a meteor strike. There could be more out in the universe that NASA hasn't observed yet.

In April of 1998, a photo was taken that was blury due to Martian clouds. Many people exclaimed that the clouds may have blocked some alien markings. When NASA took another photo in April of 2001, the photo does not seem to portray any alien markings. Furthermore, the Face looked as though it has cracked on the side. Suggesting that there are Martians on Mars and, along with that, there were Martians that made this Face, why wouldn't the Martians fix their monument when it cracks. This led me to believe that not only did the Martians on Mars not build this, but, additionally, there are no Martians on Mars.

Others may say that, comparative to the Mound Builder Indians on Earth, the Face was created by Martians bringing dirt to one spot and creating that mound. If that was the case, then how come, in all of the photos and evidence we have from Mars, NASA has never once seen a Martian. They might be hiding from us, but, like Humans, couldn't Martians have messed up, and they forgot to hide one time.

This Face is created by natural processes. Even though it has been extremely controversial over whether it is alien-made or nature-made, more evidence suggests that the Face is nature-made. Many things in the universe can cause a mound on a planet, but finding out which one is the cause of the Face may never be known.",0
"First impressions of others can be heavily influenced by differences in personality, situation, and representation. Factors such as the way one dresses, their level of confidence, or the context of their introduction can shape our initial perception of them. For example, meeting someone in an upscale restaurant surrounded by affluent peers can create a certain impression that may not be reflective of who they are. The same can be said if someone is dressed in low-cost clothing or is seen in a less than desirable environment. In certain situations, someone who is naturally quiet may be seen as shy and unapproachable, whereas in another context, they may be interpreted as being serious and logical. 

Representation also weighs heavily on our opinion of others. Someone who is seen as being attractive and stylish, for instance, may seem fun and outgoing, while someone who is seen as less attractive may be seen as uninteresting or dull. This is an unjustified first impression, as we can never truly know someone merely from sight. It is important to be mindful of factors that can shape our initial opinion of others before we form assumptions that may not be true. 

In summary, first impressions of others can often be inaccurate due to personality, situation, and representation. It is necessary to consider the context and other factors before forming an opinion of someone, so that one can strive to be more mindful of the assumptions they make.",1
"There are many reasons to believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. One reason is that it is easier to find a job if you are broadly educated. A second reason is that it is easier to think critically and come up with new ideas if you are broadly educated. A third reason is that it is easier to learn new things if you are broadly educated.

One reason to believe that it is better to be broadly educated is that it is easier to find a job. A recent study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that “specialists are in high demand, but their skills are narrowly tailored. They are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed than those with a broader range of skills.” In other words, if you are broadly educated, you will be more likely to find a job than if you specialize in one specific subject.

A second reason to believe that it is better to be broadly educated is that it is easier to think critically and come up with new ideas. A study by the University of Warwick found that “broadly educated people are more likely to be creative and come up with new ideas.” In other words, if you are broadly educated, you will be more likely to come up with new ideas than if you specialize in one specific subject.

A third reason to believe that it is better to be broadly educated is that it is easier to learn new things. A study by the University of Edinburgh found that “broadly educated people are better at learning new things.” In other words, if you are broadly educated, you will be better at learning new things than if you specialize in one specific subject.

"I believe it is very important to limiit car use on the road. People even are starting to sell their cars for example 70 percent of vaubans families do not own a car people say it is less stress full without a car and easier

There are plenty of other safe and eficent  ways to get around town other then a car. for example bicyles,scother,walking and the list goes on and on. Also we running out of fuel we need to conserve what we have left it is very important to me that pople dont take avtange of this

People dont not realize this. There are also many advantes in limiting car use for eveyone in their own way for example by using less gass we can also help are planet which is very important caus people do not realize of think about what they are to doing to the earth for are next  genaration to come overall we should limit car use and if every one does their you would be amazed on mush much of a difference and change we can make for the planet",0
"There was a time when cars were a new invention that everyone wanted or needed, but as of recent years cars have found themselves on the decline. There are many speculated reasons as to why people aren't as interested in getting a car and driving themselves around. One of the main theories seems to be that with new technological advancements are making carpools simple organize and knowing when and where the closest city bus will arrive easier to find out. Also, the technology of today makes it easy to contact and feel connected with your friends without having to go out and see them. Whatever the reason may be, the decline in car usage is a great advantage worldwide. The benefits of limited car usage are a better environment, less traffic stress, and healthier people.

Cars are the second most common source of air pollution in the United States. In Paris, cars were so heavily used that their pollution levels were near those of Beijing, China known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. When Parisians heard this, they took action right away. They rotated day long bans on personal cars with even numbered license plates and odd numbered licence plates. After about a week of this rotating ban, with a few exceptions, the smog levels had lowered enough that all cars could be allowed again. Luckily, this experience made the people of Paris realize how much cars were harming their environment. Cars are a large source of carbon emissions all over the world so lessening their use is essential to reviving our hurting environment.

Another advantage to limiting the use of cars is less traffic and less accidents. Public transportation drivers are more skilled and practiced than everyday drivers. Arguably, they are safer behind the wheel than your average citizen. In addition to that, having less cars on the road makes it safer to walk, bike, skateboard, or even rollerblade to your destination. Also, less cars means less traffic. Although on public transportation there are bus stops and such, traffic jams would be nearly eradicated if there were that many less cars on the road.

The last important advantage of having fewer cars is a personal health benefit. Driving can be seen as stressful. You have your life as well as the lives of people around you in your hands. Not only can the concept of driving itself be stressful, but things such as reckless drivers and heavy traffic are very hard for people to deal with patiently and safely. It would be better for people's emotional health to not have to deal with driving. Avoiding cars is also better for people's physical health in both cleaner environments and more physical activity. With the lessened levels of polution, as mentioned before, people would have cleaner air to breathe and a healthier environment to live in. The amount of physical activity in citizens would also increase. With people being able to walk, bike, skateboard, etc. to their desired destination the obesity numbers would decrease. Without cars, people's emotional and physical health would largely improve.

Overall, limiting the global use of cars would greatly benefit people worldwide. Due to the recent spread of the idea of being carfree and more concious of our environment pollution levels are already decreasing. Advantages coming from a much needed decreae in car usage also include safer roads and less stressed, healthier people. A decline in the number of personal vehicles on the road would lead to a happier, safer, and healthier world.",0
"There is no one answer to the question of whether work is more stressful now than in the past. Some people might say that work is more stressful because there is more pressure to succeed and to produce results. Others might say that work is less stressful because people have more options for finding a work-life balance.

I believe that work is both more and less stressful than in the past. On the one hand, there is more pressure to succeed and to produce results. On the other hand, people have more options for finding a work-life balance.

For example, when I was a law student, I had to work long hours in order to keep up with my coursework. I did not have the option of leaving work at 5pm to spend time with my family. Now, there are more opportunities for people to work flexible hours or to work from home, which makes it easier to balance work and family responsibilities.

However, there is also more competition for jobs, and people are often required to work longer hours. This can lead to more stress and less leisure time.

In conclusion, work is both more and less stressful than in the past. It depends on the individual and on the particular job.",1
"There is no single answer to this question as it depends on what one considers to be important for students. However, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

One reason why understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts is that facts can be easily forgotten, while understanding ideas and concepts can help students to apply what they have learned to new situations. For example, a student who memorizes the dates of all the U. S. Presidents may be able to answer a test question about them, but if they are asked to explain the impact that a particular president had on the country, they will be unable to do so. On the other hand, a student who understands the concept of democracy will be able to apply it to different situations and explain it's impact, even if they cannot remember every detail about every democracy that has ever existed.

Another reason why understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts is that it can help students to develop critical thinking skills. If a student only learns facts, they will be able to answer questions about those facts, but they will not be able to think critically about them. For example, if a student learns that the American Revolution began in 1775, they will be able to answer questions about the Revolution, but they will not be able to think about why it began or what impact it had on the country. However, if a student understands the concept of revolution, they will be able to think critically about why it happened and what impact it had.

Ultimately, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This is because understanding ideas and concepts can help students to apply what they have learned to new situations, develop critical thinking skills, and think about complex issues in a more sophisticated way.",1
"With the rise of technology and the internet, cyberbullying has become a major concern for parents and educators around the world. Cyberbullying is defined as aggressive behavior or harassment that occurs over digital devices such as cell phones, computers, tablets, and gaming consoles. This type of bullying can take many forms including sending mean-spirited messages, posting damaging or embarrassing photos or videos online, spreading lies about someone else’s behavior or private information online, hacking into personal accounts to steal passwords or other confidential information, stealing an individual’s identity by creating false social media profiles under their name and more. The effects of cyberbullying can often be far more destructive than traditional types of bullying due to its anonymous nature which allows bullies to remain hidden while reaching large numbers of people with much less effort than face-to-face encounters require. Victims may experience feelings of shame and worthlessness as well as depression; they may even develop suicidal thoughts in extreme cases. It is not just young victims who suffer from this form of harassment either - adults are increasingly becoming targets too. In order to prevent cyberbullying from occurring in the first place educational institutions should be equipped with effective policies that address what constitutes unacceptable behaviors within their school's virtual community space(s). Additionally schools should provide training sessions on how to safely navigate through various forms of digital media for both students and faculty/staff members alike so everyone can be informed about potential pitfalls associated with using these technologies responsibly. Furthermore it would benefit if appropriate consequences were implemented for those found guilty engaging in any form of cyberbulling - ranging from verbal warnings up to expulsion depending on severity level off offense committed - , so that all involved parties understand how serious it is taken at said institution when this kind happen violation occur again in future situation involving same offender(s). . By providing clear protocols relating to acceptable virtual conduct coupled with proactive measures designed educate students on safe usage technology we can begin tackle issue cyberbull",1
"In the modern world, technology plays an increasingly large role in our daily lives. While the limitation of physical contact between people may be considered a drawback of technology, it is not the only possible outcome. There are undeniable benefits to technological advancement, particularly in terms of reducing the amount of time needed to complete daily tasks and increasing our autonomy and convenience. 

One distinct advantage to technology is that it reduces the amount of time needed to complete mundane tasks. For example, the introduction of automated machines has drastically reduced the amount of time needed to manufacture products. Similarly, online banking services help people manage their finances faster through the convenience of automation. 

Not only does technology reduce the time spent on tasks, it also provides greater autonomy and convenience to people's lives. With the help of smartphones and other devices, people can access a plethora of information, meaning they have access to a host of tools and knowledge at the touch of a button. This makes tasks that would have otherwise been difficult or impossible not long ago significantly easier.

In conclusion, it is clear that technology can provide a substantial positive impact on people's lives. By reducing the amount of time required to do certain tasks and providing greater autonomy and convenience, technology has the potential to make life easier and simpler for everyone.",1
"Dear State Senator,

This letter of argument is to emphasize why we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. There are very reasonable arguments for both claims as to if we should keep or abolish the Electoral College. Primarily, the Electoral College is the selection of electors by popular vote to represent their supported party in the official presidential election. There is a total of 538 Electoral College electors and it only takes the majority, 270 votes, to elect the president. It is not fair that the general population does not get an independent vote.

It is not the ordinary people who get to choose the president they want; it is dependent upon which party the elector chooses. Voters don't have control over who their electors vote for. As said in the second article, Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000 against Bush however, Gore lost the electoral vote resulting in the loss of the presidential election. In the past, there have been voters who refused to vote for their party's candidate and voted for whomever. There is also the concern of a tie in the electoral vote.

If that were to happen then there would certainly be no chance that the popular vote would have an impact on the selection of the president because it would now be in the hands of the House of Representatives. The Electoral College is unfair to voters; they do not get the final choice as to where their vote goes. They are not voting for the presidential candidate they want. The voters are voting for a slate of electors. However, there are some benefits to having an Electoral College such as larger states getting more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states and it also avoids Run-Off elections which is when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes.

State Senator, please realize that this is not fair or justifiable. There may be an upside to the Electoral College, however, it is in my strongest opinion based on factual content that this is not a fair method and it should be abolished. Being empathetic for the ordinary voters of the United States would provide clarity for your opinion on the situation. Imagine if you were a general voter who did not get an official vote in the presidential election; you would feel cheated also. This is why I ask you to strongly consider these legitimate words.",0
"Yes, I believe that using this technology can be used to read students' emotional expressions. I think this type of technology could improve the way we learn and live today.

If this technology was used on a wider or more broad scale there would be so much more learning going on and it'll be easier and also more fun. Students' would actually like coming to school morre ecause this type of technology could improve our lives so much and we could learn so much more.",0

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my viewpoint on the matter of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After careful consideration of various arguments, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained as the method for selecting the President.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the election process. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely to occur compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winner's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. With a majority of electoral votes being required to elect the President, there is a higher level of certainty in determining the winner (Posner 18).

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters a sense of collective ownership and representation for all citizens across the nation. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, ensuring that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents a candidate with only regional favoritism from becoming president, promoting a more inclusive leadership that considers the interests of all regions (Posner 19).

Another significant advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to emphasize the importance of swing states. As noted by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method motivates candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This encourages voters in these states to pay close attention to the campaign, leading to more thoughtful and informed decisions. Toss-up states become the deciding factor in the election, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters have the power to shape the outcome (Posner 20).

Additionally, the Electoral College grants due importance to large states. Judge Posner explains how the Electoral College balances the weight of large states losing representation due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, as their victories yield a higher number of electoral votes. This maintains a political balance that acknowledges the diverse needs and interests of both small and large states (Posner 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate achieves a majority of the popular votes, this could lead to further complications in the election process. With the Electoral College, the clear winner is determined based on the majority of electoral votes received, ensuring a decisive outcome (Posner 22).

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in non-competitive states, the fact remains that people vote to express their political preference rather than in the belief that their vote alone will decide the election (Posner 23). The Electoral College system upholds the fundamentals of our democratic process while maintaining a fair and effective means to elect the President.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved as the method of electing the President of the United States. Its ability to ensure certainty, foster unity and representation, highlight swing states, provide importance to large states, and avoid run-off elections are all valuable advantages that contribute to the effectiveness of our democratic system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you will carefully consider the benefits of maintaining the Electoral College in future discussions on this issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Have you every heard of the Face on Mars? Some people even think that the face was an alien. NASA (the people who found the face on Mars) could say otherwise. NASA has many diffrent ways that this is not an alien. The three are that no alien monuments anywhere, that NASA spent countless time trying to make sure that they were wrong, and that the shadows and the lighting make it look like a face.

The first reason why it is not an alien is because they looked for an alien monument and didn't find one. This either means that NASA took all that time and did not find one, or there is not alien monument which means that this being an alien is slim. Not having a monument means that the aliens didn't have a home or a place to worship. NASA even had a camera ten times sharper than what they found the face with,MIchael Malin and his MArs Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos(7). This goes to show that the monument and the aliens do not exist.

The second reason is that they tried countless times trying to find more. They spent many years trying to find answers but they never found them. The only answer they got was that the alien they were hopping for wasn't present or was present. On April 8, 2001, that was thier last try. They had amazing pizels but still got nothing, Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution (10.)

Finally, the shadows made it look like it was a face. Even though it looked like a face, we never know if a shadow hit it good enough that it made it look like that. NASA states that only this one had unusual shadows to make it look like an egyptian Pharaoh, (2.) This states that unusual shadowing made the mesa look unusual. The later years, the mesa looks less and less like a face.

This shows that the Face on Mars looks more and more like a shadow. Many years have been put into this Face on Mars. Yet there is not that much they found. NASA would have got a lot of money if they found it. Yet they turned it down because they knew that it was not an alien like they would have hopped.",0

What is the difference between smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage - says Constantin Stanislavvsky. Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?

We humans everyday perform or express the same impressive calculation such as any subject like math homework or science. Through all this the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. In paragraph 6 lines 6 and 7 this states that while the use of technology can read our emotional expressions A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. In the use of technology then it could modify the use of how people have their emotions and expressions.

Meanwhile, some computers can handle the use of emotions people have and their expressions depedning on how they calculate emotions. Not only can the computer detect the feelings it makes a 3-D form of the human face or a 3-D image of the painting. In paragraph 4 the first line the article says that The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, ''even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). However, everyone has emotions, feelings, and expressions, but some you can not verify or tell how they are feeling or whether they tell you they do not know what is their suggestion to it. Computers need to know that as well.

As in paragraph 2, everyone has emotions that just you can not verify or tell of how they are feeling or their confused and bored. In excluslive this software can be very valuable to many students in very many ways although, it is going to help them with observing many emtional faces and expressions. Not just the computers can help them observe the faces in paragraph 6 lines 8, 9, and 10 The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Within this information if students feel sad, worried, and happy this all at once the software in the computer can still detect the emotions of this human or painting.

It takes so many muscles just to frown, so why not smile it it takes less muscles just by muscles you can tell the way someone is feeling, when someone is happy they get wrinkles by their eyes. Stated in paragraph 7 line 8 In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. It is all about the muscular action units.

In paragraph 9 lines 2, 3, and 4 it says According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. In this information, To an expert or computer system, faces do not lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smilimg politician or celebrity is not being truthful. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!",0
"Living in a small town has its advantages and disadvantages, but overall it is an amazing experience. With fewer people to compete with for jobs and resources, life can be simpler and more peaceful. It also provides a safe environment for raising children as there are fewer outside influences that might otherwise put them in harm's way. One of the best things about living in a small town is that everyone gets to know each other. This can mean help is just around the corner if something goes wrong or if you need advice on anything from plumbing to parenting. Plus, friendships last longer due to the lack of people moving away or changing lives too frequently - so you’re sure to have lifelong friends who really understand you!. However, living in a small town isn't without its drawbacks either; there may be limited job opportunities available nearby as well as education options if going beyond high school is desired by some members of your family or community. There could also be less access to basic services like health care providers or larger stores where one could find specialty products not sold at local shops - both inconveniences which can take some getting used-to for newcomers!. Still though, these issues pale in comparison to all the wonderful aspects of being part of such close-knit communities where traditions are passed down through generations and stories shared between long-time residents keep culture alive even when times change rapidly elsewhere. Small towns provide an opportunity for growth—both personal and communal—in ways cities never could; having closer relationships with neighbors allows us learn more deeply about ourselves while deepening understanding amongst those we interact most closely with every day!",1
"I disagree to school board adding an half hours to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family.

some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students don't have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor.

If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore.

"Having a good attitude is one of the most important factors for leading a happy and successful life. It can make or break a person's experience in the highly competitive environments of school or work. Studies show that having a positive attitude helps to maximize a person's potential and increases performance. For example, many athletes cite their positive attitude as one of the contributing factors to their success. A good attitude can also lead to greater success in relationships, as demonstrated by research that has found correlation between having a positive outlook and experiencing satisfying relationships.

On the other hand, although having a good attitude most of the time can bring many benefits, it can be detrimental in certain situations. For instance, when faced with challenging tasks, having a too positive outlook can lead to an unrealistic estimation of one's ability to accomplish the task. This can cause disappointment and diminish motivation. 

It is of utmost importance for parents to teach children how to cultivate an optimistic attitude and instill in them the understanding of why attitude matters. Studies have shown that developing a positive outlook from a young age increases chances of having successful outcomes in adult years.",1
"There are few people who can can imagine living a full life in this generation without these glorified metal boxes with wheels attached to them even fewer set living a life similar to that as a goal. The advantages of limiting the amount of cars being used are surprisingly unique due to the dwindling amount of disadvantages there are. Some of these advantages include reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and that there will be a reduction in smog. It is always nice to see humanity band together, willingly or forcefully, to work for a common good.

Let us begin with the most pressing issue: preserving the environment. Studies have shown that nearly 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. come from passenger cars Rosenthal 1, 5. Reducing these greenhouse gases, which pose a threat to the Earth's atmosphere, would be an improvement, although slow, still an improvement nonetheless. While this would not be the immediately noticeable of changes, making an effort to cleanse our cities of pollution would be.

Moving on, some places have taken this matter into their own hands, matters that some would describe as extreme. Paris, France is one of these examples, enforcing a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city...motorists...ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine... Duffer, 1011.It is pleasant to see a city taking this matter into their own hands. This ban, though, did spark an uproar on the Internet, but it did die down. Many approaches to cleansing cityair have been drastic, but others such as in Columbia, had some sort of event where the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Selsky, 21. This did allow a public freedom, despite there still being a fine in place. The remarkable fact of this is that even though cars are being banned, a large portion of the targeted population actually do not mind the change, even the rain hasn't stopped people from participatingSelsky, 23.

Suprisingly enough, this carban revolution is still going on today. Many more people are starting to realize the benefits to the ban. Elisabeth Rosenthal, in her article The End of Car Culture even adds in that many sociologists believe...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment...34. This simply furthers the ideal that humanity as a whole CAN see a chance to change, wants to desperately do so, and WILL do so...eventually.",0

The first reason why visiting a local museum should be encouraged is because they provide an opportunity for individuals to gain knowledge about their own community's culture and heritage without having to leave home. This allows them to gain insight into how their lives are connected with those who lived before them, which is essential for understanding our shared history as humans being on Earth. Additionally, when exploring different areas within the same city or county, these places often contain artifacts from past generations that would otherwise go unseen had you not taken advantage of your local museuem's offerings. A second reason why going to your local museum should be encouraged is because such visits offer unique learning experiences that cannot always be found elsewhere; these include interactive exhibits where guests are able to touch certain items or participate in hands-on activities related specifically with what they may have seen inside the exhibit itself – something that many other types of educational facilities simply do not offer. Moreover, by experiencing firsthand some aspects of various cultures’ histories through artwork or archaeological pieces housed in said museums - self-knowledge regarding human evolution can easily become further enriched allowing us all look at both ourselves and each other differently than before while simultaneously gaining more compassion towards one another overall due its interconnective nature between us all through time. . 	. . . 	. 	. 	. . . . . 	. . . . . . 	. . . . . . . Finally, having access and familiarity with nearby museums opens up opportunities for individuals and families alike looking for fun activities outside traditional venues like shopping malls or movie theatres; this helps especially during times when weather conditions",1
"Students wouldn't benefit from attending to classes at home. Schools offer different options that distance learning does not. It's a good opportunity to attend regular classes. Everyone can learn in different ways but a better option it's by attending normal classes. People have the option to choose whith what they feel comfortable. Attending to regular classes gives the opportunity to pick their own classes. We can have many benefits by this. If students attend to regular schools they have the opportunity to meet new people, to participate at clubs and they have the chance to talk and get help from teachers.

Students who attend normal schools have the opportunity to meet new people. Not everyone likes to be anti-social and to be alone without not knowing others. Sometimes is great to have a person that we can tell everything. By going to school, we have the chance to talk to a thousand of people and to make new friends. Once Generic_Name got the options to pick home school or to attend to normal classes. She chose to do classes at home. She was happy for the idea that she has not to wake up early. For the first couple of weeks everything was fine. She was getting use to it. One day she realized that she has no friends; she feels alone. Generic_Name when to talk to her mom about the way she was feeling. Her mom told her that if she weren't pick to stay at home and doing distance learning; she weren't to feel that way. Generic_Name thought about what her mom told her and she decide that the best option was attend to normal classes at school. If we attend to regular classes, we are not going to feel alone and we can make new friends.

Schools provides the chance to participate at clubs. While distance learning don't have activities or clubs for students to do. Public schools have different kind of activities or clubs that they can enjoy. Activities and clubs are a good way to help and to prepare students for the future. They have the option to enjoy a team from their preference. For example, a person who like football. They might like to form part of the football team and that's what normal schools provides. If this person form part of a football team; he can get scholarships to participate in big leagues. From clubs students can get an idea of what career they want to get in the future, to discover new things, and to get experience from this different activities.

Other might argue that distance learning gives students time for their jobs, they can avoid being getting in trouble and they can take care of their youngest siblings while they are at home. However, people by attending to classes have the chance to get help from teachers. It's a reality that not everyone is capable to understand easily. Sometimes we need a push or help from others who knows about the things we don't. The awesome thing about normal schools is that teachers stay a little longer after school to help with hard work. To pay attention during classes can be hard because of other classmates are making noise or it's really hard to understand. Teachers talk about our grades and gives us advices to improve them. Talking to teachers helps to understand because they give us a deeply explanation.

At school people have the chance to make new friends, to have the oppoortunity to try new activities and to improve academically with the help of teachers. Some people can be in disagreement with public schools, but they have on mind that sometimes it can be a better option. School it's a good way to get out of home for at least some hours. Not everyone likes to being at home for the whole day. At school we can have fun with our friends, lunch time is unique and that is something the distance learning don't offer. Activities after school are a good way to keep people out of trouble. To help them to choose a good path. School have a variety of ways to have fun, not just by playing, also by learning.",0
"Nowadays, sport has become more and more important on the world stage. I think it is a good thing that we are able to see the best players from all over the globe compete against each other. However, I do not think that this is the only way to solve the problem of racism in sport. We need to look at the bigger picture and think about how we can make sport more inclusive for everyone.

What do you think needs to be done in order to improve the situation of black athletes in sports? What are your thoughts on how to do this? I believe that there are a lot of things that can be improved in the way that sports are run. For example, there is no need for a quota system for athletes of a certain race. There are plenty of athletes from other races who are just as good or even better than some of their white counterparts. It is also important to make sure that athletes are given the opportunity to compete on a level playing field and that they are not discriminated against in any way. This is something that I have been working on for the past few years, and I hope that it will be implemented sooner rather than later.",1
"Cars are a life line and much used tool for people on day to day commutes. Can we live without i? In Vauban Germany there is a town that does not own one car. How do they get around then? They city trans and running. the reason is the cars are spouing out tons of green gasses. Its not only in Vauban either. This is a trend world wide in most suburbs.

Does everyone agree with this no car trend? After Paris recived a near record pollution they banned driving in the city. On some days the city would allow odd licence plates. On other days the city would allow even number plates. Near 4,000 drivers were given a 31$ (22-euro) fine. This cleared the smog over a period of time. What was the effect on the city after words? Smog cleared from the city vassly but. Citizens were able to freely use the transit without cost. There wwere acceptions to plug in cars and viecles holding more than three people.

On the other side of the world people in Bogota Colombia created and set a carfree day. On this day people Hiked, Biked, and took buses to destinations. This was a ecelent strategy to promot alternative transportation and reduced pollution for this large city of 7 million. People who did not go along with the day were fined 25$. Now to more close by cities Cali and Valledupar have joined the event. This has been amazing for upcoming local city buissnessis. Also reconstruction on side walks and parks.

What about the largest car loving cuontry, America? Well it seems the trend has effected us as well. Although there are no limits the driving has seemingly cooled over the years. This will be a long term cultral shift with companies like Ford and Mercedes calling hemselves mobility companies. When someone does drop the habbit it is hard to pick up again. Even driving by young people has dropped 23%. These changes have changed the pollution rate and many more car related problems. There mabey a time where traffic jams no longer exist.",0
"Some businesses have adopted a four day work week with each day consisting of ten hours

.To conserve energy and resources, my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours. because everyone get tired or estreced, do not make enought money to buy resources, and dont have enougt time to be with the family.

The beneficts to conserve energy is to sleep the eight hours. so you can conserve the energy and don't be extreced about be more time in school. In contrast if you do not sleep well you feel like you will felt sleep. so is better less hours of school because eveyone will conserve enegy and the less hours of school can bemore better because everyone would be consentrated and learn more.

Is hard to be in school and have a job after school. because both of them are important for our life. but must people what need is money. so must people prefer to work and make money than have more hours of school. for this reason many people prefer to have money because can buy any resources or enyting that they need.

for example. If I am working and also going to school and the school day extend for two hours. I feel very extreced, so many peolple cuit school. And prefer to work.

There are also some disadvantages because if they extend the school day two hours is not inought time to be togeteher with the family.

everyone need time to have and be with the family because family is importan. so for these reason my chool should not fallow this model. if you spend more time in a job or in school there is not enought time for the family and olso everyone need time to make the differents responsabiliies that have.

for these reasons my school should not follow this model because many people get extreced or cuit school. so they can conserve anergy and resources and have have enought time with the family. and the hours of school everyone can be more consetrated and don't felt sleep and learn the possible.",0
"Would you like to act like someone else when your not? You should always be yourself nobody should ever tell u how to carry yourself. You ever heard of the quote,Don't judge a book by its cover?'' I honestly believe in that. I was once a scrawny kid getting bullied cause of the way I carried myself and dressed. I never got the chance to get the shoes I wanted or the clothes so other kids who were on the football team would bully me. But little did they know i was the nicest and honest kid at

Generic_School.

In the year 2015 throughout 2018 I was someone I really wasn't. I was in the streets doing the opposite of what my mother showed me. Robbing people, fighting, breaking curfew, breaking into peoples cars. I was going through it because I was tired of people bullying me, I was tired of people emberrassing me infront of other kids.

By the time I tried to get a job,all they woud do was look at me head to toe and say they arent looking for employees right now even though their was a help wanted sign out front. Even my moms friends would judge me on my looks just because I have tattoos and have a mean mugging face. I may have a bad background but that was me trying to be somebody im not, I was trying to fit in with the bullies, wiith the kids who used to bully me.

Moral of the story is don't let nobody get to you and make you into something your not. I wish I could go back and prevent myself into being someone whom im not. My uncle got caught smuggling narcotics and is praying everyday he gets out. This all happened because he was trying to be someone he wasn't.

To conclude, A couple misedemenors and felonies can ruin your entire life. Don't be someone your not, Be yourself.",0
"Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first Model-T. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.

In like matter of this, article, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, Paris bans driving due to smog, by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of near-record pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22-euro fine ($31). The same order would be applied to odd-numbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.

Likewise, in the article, Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a car-free day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having car-free days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.

In conclusion, the use of less cars and having car-free days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do. So, who's with me?",0
"The debate about whether animals should be treated as pets or resources of food and clothing is a complex one. On one hand, animals can provide humans with important benefits such as food, clothing, and medical research. On the other hand, animals can also be treated as beloved companions, making a major contribution to our lives. My view is that animals should be treated as both, depending on the situation.

First, animals can be a critical source of food and clothing. As a major source of sustenance, they provide essential nutrition to humans. People rely on animals for a variety of meat, dairy, and eggs. Animal by-products, like leather and wool, are also important materials for clothing. Additionally, animals are used in medical research to help discover treatments and medications that can save human lives.

Second, animals should also be treated as beloved pets. It is widely known that pet ownership can provide humans with a variety of health benefits, such as reduced stress, lower blood pressure, and improved social connectedness. Often, people form strong emotional attachments to their pets, treating them as family members. Additionally, having a pet can bring happiness and joy to a person’s life.

In conclusion, animals should be treated as both resources of food and clothing and beloved pets. While animals are important sources of sustenance and materials, they can also be an important part of our lives. As the debate about animal treatment continues, it is important to consider both sides of the issue. Ultimately, animals should be respected and treated with love and care, regardless of whether they are seen as sources of sustenance or beloved companions.",1
"I am one of the many scientist of NASA and what i'd like for people to understand is that the face on mars is really just a natural landform of the moon and not any ancient civilization on Mars. Although our defenders of our budget and some of us certainly wish there was a form of life on Mars.

What it is that your seeing that you call a face on mars is a Mesa. The mesa or the huge rock formation,you all have seen has ended up unlike some other mesas,ended up resembeling a human head. Formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth. This very well did draw all of your attention to Mars which is somewhat good for your knownledge,but with you all thinking there is aliens of some sort it is hard to come by whats true or not to some that have not picked a side of whos right or wrong.

We had to roll the space craft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view and it was a clear photo we took from that so if they're were any objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptain-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were! So again but lastly What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. It also reminded Jim Garvin of most of middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa that is somewhat the same height as the Face in Mars.",0
"School uniforms have been a controversial topic in recent years, leading to much debate over their necessity. Proponents of the school uniform argue that having students wear uniforms eliminates the competition between peers and creates a sense of unity amongst students; opponents often cite expense as well as infringement on personal freedom as valid reasons against enforcing such regulations. It is clear that while there are some benefits associated with wearing school uniforms, ultimately they should not be mandated. In theory, dress codes help to level the playing field between students from different economic backgrounds by eliminating any class distinctions between those who can purchase expensive clothing and those who cannot. This could potentially reduce bullying or teasing based on appearance and make for a more harmonious atmosphere within the classroom setting; however this has yet to be proven conclusively in studies conducted thus far. Additionally, proponents suggest that since everyone looks similar it helps foster feelings of community, pride and solidarity among staff members and pupils alike - regardless whether or not these effects occur remains uncertain though. On an individual level, requiring students to wear uniforms infringes upon basic rights such as self-expression which are necessary for growth through adolescence into adulthood; furthermore it restricts creativity by forcing all individuals into the same mold - literally! Furthermore despite claims made by supporters of mandatory uniform policies regarding cost savings - due to only needing one or two sets rather than multiple outfits daily - research done at Cornell University showed no significant budget-related difference when comparing schools with strict dress codes versus those without them. In addition purchasing new clothes twice per year (once at beginning of semester/school year) proves costly even if doing so saves money in long run; many families simply cannot afford buying multiple articles every six months – resulting in further inequality among classes which already exist due largely socioeconomic factors beyond control parents/guardians themselves (e.g., income levels). . In conclusion although initially appealing for its promises equality & unity amongst classmates there appears little evidence indicating widespread benefits associated with mandating school uniforms;",1
"It is not value of ad pop ups from a computer to detect student or teachers emotion, it's not right plus i think it's a watse of time to try and collect every emotion of evryone who uses a computer, cause at some point in time the people will start to get angry about the whole emotions crap and maybe get rid of them, they may like at first but one day their just gonna get rid of it.

Like in the article it said how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? six emotions the computer has to track, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. A computer that can sence and track muscle movement and emotions, kinda werid and freaked out to me if i had this computer and i think most people around the world would stick to just regular computers or laptops and not buy this emotional computer ad poping up crap. I would think more than emotional computers, thinking more advanced or just regular old computers thats what i would do if i were creating computers.

I think we shouldn't nchange anything at all about computers if it's gonna lead to a riot or people rising up to the company because of the computers, we want regular computers back not the stupid emotional ones anymore! u know... i would do the same thing as well.",0
"I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. Another big reason is that we really don't know just how much computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad.

Performing this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions. New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code. Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units. We really don't know how much the computer can do, it can detect if you're happy or sad, and make computer-animated faces.

In a whole, this is a lot to disagree with, since computers are taking over our world now so I believe this is a great idea. Reason being is that we have video imagery, the amazing and undiscovered knowledge of a computer, and our own brains because we calculate expressions on our own every day. These our all major factors that align with the fact that I believe technology should be able to read students' emotional expressions.",0
"I agree that the traditional Chinese practice of not telling cancer patients the truth should be changed along with the development of modernization. There are several reasons for this.

First, cancer patients have a right to know their diagnosis. They need to be able to make informed decisions about their treatment and their future.

Second, cancer is a very serious disease, and patients and their families need to be able to cope with it emotionally. Keeping the diagnosis secret can make it harder for everyone to deal with the reality of the situation.

Third, modern medicine is making great strides in the treatment of cancer, and patients need to be aware of all the options available to them. By keeping the diagnosis secret, families may be depriving patients of the chance to receive the best possible treatment.

In conclusion, I believe that the traditional Chinese practice of not telling cancer patients the truth should be changed. Cancer patients have a right to know their diagnosis, and modern medicine is making great strides in the treatment of cancer. Keeping the diagnosis secret can make it harder for everyone to deal with the reality of the situation.",1
"Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic and should be replaced with a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several important advantages that should be considered. 

The first advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. Unlike a popular vote system where disputes over the outcome are more likely, the winner of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This allows for a more streamlined and stable process, ensuring a clear winner in each election cycle.

A second advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, making it necessary for candidates to have broad appeal across different regions. This prevents candidates with only regional support from being elected and ensures that the President represents the interests of the entire nation.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its focus on swing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign heavily in swing states. This prompts them to communicate their policies and listen to the concerns of voters in these key states. Consequently, swing state voters, who are more likely to be well-informed and thoughtful, have a greater impact on determining the outcome of the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores political balance to the weight of large states. While the popular vote may favor candidates who focus solely on the issues of densely populated areas, the Electoral College ensures that candidates devote attention to smaller states as well. This prevents large states from dominating the election process and ensures that candidates address the concerns of voters in both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This avoids the complexity and potential delays associated with runoff elections, providing a more efficient and decisive election process.

Some argue that the Electoral College discourages voter participation, particularly for individuals in states heavily favoring one political party. However, voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, suggesting that voters are motivated by the desire to express their political preferences rather than the belief that their vote will single-handedly decide the outcome of the election.

In conclusion, while there are criticisms of the Electoral College, I believe the advantages it provides in terms of certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balance for large states, and avoidance of runoff elections make it a valuable system for electing the President of the United States. It ensures fair representation of the entire nation and promotes a stable and decisive electoral process. Therefore, I request that you consider these factors when deciding the future of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your continued efforts to promote the best interests of our state and our nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is widely acknowledged for serves a purpose as a method of selecting a president and vice president, not a legitimate college. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between having the President elected by a vote in Congress and an election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This process of choosing a president needs to be modified into popular vote for the reasons that the Electoral College was established to actually vote a slate of electors, voters feel disenfranchised, and is unfair to voters.

To begin with, the Electoral College was actually established for voters to vote for a series of electors, which then get together to have the final decision. Stated in What is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register,  The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise...process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. This means that under this system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors who then elect the president. The voters sometimes aren't told full front that they are chosing someone else and not always can they control who their electors are voting, leaving many puzzled. Voters aren't to be puzzled. They are to vote who they'd like because it allows them a freedom to express who they want because they are strongly acknowledged of the troubles of their society and how they should be handled.

In addition, the Electoral College makes voters feel discouraged and disenfranchised. According to In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner, it is stated,  No region...has enough electoral votes to lect a president...residents of the other regions are likely to feel...that their votes do not count...that he really isn't their president. This means that voters feel that the president they chose is their president because they believe their votes count.

furthermore, the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because the candidates they vote for don't spend time with them. Sizes matter to the candidates. According to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, it is stated, ...the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates do't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning... This quote conveys that because some states are small in population and size, they will not help the candidate succeed. This is immensely discouraging to the voters because they feel worthless for not being big in size. Candidates should not have an excuse to not thank all their voters because every vote counts, not matter how small.

Admittedly, the Electoral College allows a clear and certain outcome because it exceeds the popular vote, however, the method is actually turning off potential voters for a candidate. The popular vote allows every voter to express their opinions because the overall vote chooses the popular president.

In the final analysis, a change is needed because with the Electoral College many candidates are losing potential voters considering that the qualified feel that they arn't doing much by voting considering they aren't voting for the president, but a gamut of electors to vote for them. They alos express the feeling of discontent and unfairness because they feel that they don't count and know they have no chance at winning.",0
"In 1976 Viking fly to Mars, and when they orbit/circle the mars they see a big head that look like pharoah head.

I think that the head was form by itself when the heat from Mars rise and it burn some of the rock and form the big head. I don't think it was made by alien because if they were in Mars they would burn when the sun come or when the heat rise from Mars. If it were made by alien then we would see their foot print or some symbol or marking that is unusual to Earth. The people who was there to take this photo said it was Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. It said that on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter camera (MOC) team snapped a picture 10 time sharper then the original Viking photo. There was no alien monument after all. So, the head was created by landform and if there were alien they would have seen them or take a photo of them but there was none so it was created by landform.

In conclusion, the head that was on Mars was actually created by landform, not by alien because if it was created by alien then they would have seen them when they orbit the Mars and also it is not alien monument it is actually the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west.",0
"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read student emotions in the classroom is not entirely valuable and raises some valid concerns. On one hand, this technology could allow teachers to better understand how their students are feeling in response to lessons, and help determine if students are engaged, confused, bored or experiencing other emotions. Identifying emotions in real-time could help teachers adjust their approach to improve student understanding and experience. However, this technology also poses risks to student privacy and may introduce unwanted stress. 

Constant facial monitoring could make students feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional reactions are being tracked and analyzed. Students may feel pressured to mask their true emotions out of fear a computer system will judge them negatively. This could undermine the open and trusting learning environment needed for optimal education. Additionally, singling out individual student emotions runs the risk of embarrassing them in front of peers. There are also questions around how private the data collected about students will remain and how it may be used now or in the future without consent.

Overall, while FACS technology shows potential to offer teachers insights that could aid learning, its application in the classroom raises valid concerns around student privacy, autonomy, and well-being that require serious consideration and limitations on use. A balance must be found between understanding student engagement and avoiding over-monitoring that could damage learning relationships and trust over time. More research is also needed to fully understand the impacts of constant facial tracking on young people before widespread adoption in schools. In its current form, the potential downsides of the technology appear to outweigh its benefits for reading student emotions.",1
"In this article, the author does not do a very good job with explaining why it would be worth pursuing the study of Venus. More was said about the awful climate and the countless risks that would take place rather than the benefits of risking lives and money to learn up close.

Firstly, a lot was said about the extremely dangerous climate on Venus, rather than how we could get around those dangers or why it would benefit us. In paragraph 3, the author says that there are erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. All of these terrifying weather conditions are also met with atmospheric pressure that the author says is 90 times greater than earth's. In the same way, the author tries to argue against this point in paragraph 4 when talking about how it could have supported various forms of life long ago, but thoroughly contradicts himself in paragraph 3 when he states that it could now crush even a submarine and liquefy many metals. The author does not show very strong support as to the solution of getting past the dangerous climate that he describes to be so worthy of our pursuit.

Lastly, the author seems to describe only more risks and flaws in the plan to pursue study on Venus. In paragraph 2, he states, no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Later he goes on to counter this by saying that spacecrafts could hover just above the atmosphere of Venus, but its thick atmosphere and bad climate will prevent explorers from taking photos or actual samples. Some of the main points of visiting other planets is to collect samples and research. But the author even says himself that those things would be prevented, and going to the surface of Venus to attempt research would seriously risk lives.

In conclusion, the author does not do a very good job of convincing one to believe that Venus is worth pursuing. He says himself that the climates and risks are high, but doesn't say much about the benefits of exploring this planet. Yes, it did once look strikingly similar to earth, but that was long ago, and this is a new time with new risks that exploring Venus brings.",0
"Everyone knows that there's no only one planet in this universes. Some know that the name of the planet venus was exsit. Others know that the venus planet is close to our planet, which is earth. Scientists wanted to study on the name call venus planet. They think it's possible to study on the venus. In the article The challenge of exploring Venus the author support and claim the idea.

In paragraph 1, the author include the idea of the passage by supporting how beautiful Venus is at night and adding this venus have a lot of nickname that given by humans.

So, author would probally let scientists study and visit to venus but without harming anything for humans's life or living. As a result, people will agree with the author.",0
"Some schools have programs were they pair older kid with younger kid. Many programs can help both young kid and older kids in many ways. They can also learn new stuff that later on can help them in life.

There are many ways programs like this can help older kids in many ways. One thing they can learn is to learn to help other people by showing them how to do there work or also teach them how to ask a teacher for help when needed. Another thing that the older kid can learn is to talk to people without being scared or shy this can also help them by getting a job when they grow up. Talking to the young kids can help them learn about the kid and how they act in class and around other people.

It can also help younger students in many ways. One thing it can help them with is learning new thing from the older kids somethings they can learn from them is like how to do math,homework, and how to act in the middle of class without being rude to the teacher. It can also help them learn how to respect others like there parents,teacher,and the older kids. It can also teach them how to talk to other people without being scared or shy to talk with someone or i front of the class.

Programs like this can help both young kids by making new friends with the older kids or talking to other kid and making friends that way.

"The Impact of Social Media on Gen Z Mental Health. Generation Z has grown up in the age of social media, and its effects are ubiquitous in their lives. The impact that this new form of communication has had on mental health among Generation Z is undeniable. While many use social media to stay connected with friends, make new ones, and learn about current events, it can also be a source of stress and anxiety for those struggling to navigate the complex landscape it creates. To begin with, recent studies have found that increased access to social media can lead to a decrease in mental wellbeing among Gen Z individuals. This could be due to factors such as spending too much time comparing oneself to others online or feeling overwhelmed by an influx of information from various sources. These feelings may manifest themselves into more serious issues such as depression or even increased risk-taking behavior through things like sexting or cyberbullying. Additionally, research suggests that those who spend more time using multiple platforms are at greater risk for developing poor mental health outcomes than those who limit their usage only one platform. However, there are ways in which technology companies can help minimize negative impacts while still providing users access to popular features like direct messaging and video streaming services. For example, tech giants should work towards implementing better privacy restrictions so users feel safe when sharing personal information online with family members and friends alike. Furthermore, they must create guidelines around content policies by regulating posts that contain sexist language or incite violence; this will help protect vulnerable populations from experiencing harm caused by irresponsible speech online . Finally , tech companies should allow customizable user settings so people can choose what notifications they receive without being bombarded every day by seemingly endless updates about different topics unrelated to them personally . This is especially important for younger generations since many children do not understand the implications behind these type s of notifications yet . . All in all , it’s clear that though social media presents immense opportunities for connection and growth within our society ,",1
"Being an actively engaged student can have significant benefits for both an individual's academic and future prospects. Not only does it provide a student the opportunity to gain new knowledge and skills, it also allows them to form connections with faculty and peers that can help later in life. 

One of the greatest benefits of being an actively engaged student is the chance to develop critical thinking skills. When a student actively participates in class, they are provided with the opportunity to practice their independent research, problem-solving, and communication skills. These are key skills that employers are now seeking, making actively engaged students more desirable candidates when it comes to job opportunities.

Another benefit of being an actively engaged student is gaining the ability to take a more active role in classroom discussions. Contributing to the conversation can help a student develop a deeper and more meaningful understanding of the topics being discussed, as well as build important interpersonal skills such as communication, collaboration, and leadership.

The benefits of being an actively engaged student extend beyond the academic realm. Such students have the opportunity to form valuable connections with professors and peers that may lead to furthering their studies or employment opportunities down the road. Developing these relationships can be especially helpful in the job search process, as potential employers often check a person's references before making a job offer. 

In conclusion, being an actively engaged student provides many benefits – both academically and professionally. Those who take the time to participate in classroom discussions and build relationships with faculty and peers are sure to reap the rewards in the long run.",1
"Education is a process that starts from the moment we are born and continues until the day we die. Some people believe that education is a lifelong process, while others do not agree. In my opinion, education is indeed a lifelong process, and I will explain why in this essay.

Firstly, education is not just about acquiring knowledge and skills in school or college. It is also about learning from our experiences, mistakes, and successes. We learn from our interactions with people, from the books we read, from the movies we watch, and from the places we visit. All these experiences contribute to our personal growth and development, and they help us become better individuals.

Secondly, the world is constantly changing, and we need to keep up with these changes to stay relevant. Technology, for instance, is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and we need to keep learning new skills to keep up with it. If we stop learning, we risk becoming obsolete and irrelevant in our careers and personal lives.

Thirdly, education helps us become more open-minded and tolerant. It exposes us to different cultures, perspectives, and ways of thinking. This, in turn, helps us become more empathetic and understanding towards others, which is essential in today's globalized world.

Finally, education is not just about personal growth and development. It also has a broader societal impact. Educated individuals are more likely to be engaged citizens, who participate in their communities and contribute to the betterment of society. They are also more likely to be innovative and entrepreneurial, which can lead to economic growth and job creation.

In conclusion, education is indeed a lifelong process, and it is essential for personal growth, professional development, and societal progress. We should all strive to keep learning and growing throughout our lives, and never stop seeking knowledge and wisdom.",1
"I'm a gree because if we are enthusiasm is probavility that we have success in the future for example, when we take an test if we are bored and also we not are enthusiasm is probavility that we fail and no passing the test, sometime be enthusiasm is the first step to take the success,but sometime when we are enthusiasm also is probavility that we can loss to most but there is when we need to be most enthusiasm because is like it how we can have success.

actually,

another example It's me because when my family and I decide that I will to come to United Stated and my other family that live in the United stated for many years they told me that if I coming I will going to the school I was feeling enthusiasm because I wanted to learn a new language a was the English and now I have three years living and studing here and for be enthusiasm today I speaking two languages

I think for be enthusiasm I have success for this reason I'm agree the success consist in no be scary to loss and alway be enthusiasm.

Also many peoples said that the success not consist in be enthusiasm because they said manytimes the peoples that are enthusiasm like for example, when they will stard a business or differents type of jobs they loss money for example or also they always fail in everything and the reason is because they are very enthusiasm for this rasson they said that be enthusiasm not always is good and also not a;ways consist in the success.

but is a opinion because there are many people that are agree and other are desagree because some people take a good opportunities because they said that they was very entusiasm and also there are people that never know what is success for this reason are desagree but in my situation

I was enthhusiasm and this support my success.

"Going to college is an important step in life. It can open the door to many opportunities and provide you with the chance to learn, grow, and develop as a person. There are so many benefits of attending college that it's hard to list them all but here are some of the most noteworthy ones:. Firstly, going to college allows you gain knowledge and skills that will be invaluable for your future career prospects. By taking classes related to specific fields or areas of study, such as business or engineering, you can expand your knowledge base while also gaining practical experience in those disciplines. This makes it easier for potential employers when they're looking at applicants because they know everyone who applied has been formally educated on certain topics which can give them an edge over other applicants without this educational background. Secondly, attending college gives students the opportunity to network with fellow peers by joining clubs or organizations based around common interests or hobbies. Through these activities one can create connections with like-minded people who share similar goals and aspirations which could lead to furthering their career path down the line whether through job leads or even possible mentorship relationships if successful enough connections were made throughout school time. Finally, being able attend university provides access to resources that would otherwise remain inaccessible due to financial limitations from not having gone through higher education; such resources include special events held only for university attendees where recruiters come looking for interns/employees among other things which again could prove beneficial towards one's future endeavors depending upon how well prepared they were during their time there!. . In conclusion, going off into university is both a rewarding and challenging endeavor; however its rewards far outweigh any hardships encountered along the way should one take advantage of all available resources at hand - ultimately leading them onto greater paths than ever before imaginable!",1
"In today's society, higher education is widely recognized as a prerequisite for a successful career. It is true that college graduates earn higher salaries than those who are less well-educated. However, the question of whether college students should pay the full cost of their study is a controversial one. In my opinion, I agree that they should pay the full cost of their study, and I will explain my reasons in this essay.

First and foremost, college students who pay for their tuition fee take their education more seriously. When you invest your money in something, you are more likely to value it. By paying for their own education, students are more likely to be motivated to learn, attend classes, and work hard to complete their degree. This attitude could lead to better grades, and a more successful career in the future.

Secondly, if the government or other institutions pay for college students' tuition fees, it may create a sense of entitlement in them. Many students may come to think that they are entitled to a higher education and feel that they do not need to work hard to achieve their goals. This may lead to a decrease in the quality of education, which could eventually affect the economy and society as a whole.

Lastly, it is not fair for taxpayers to pay for a college student's education when they do not have any direct benefit from it. Taxpayers' money is supposed to be used for the public good, and it'should be used to help develop infrastructure, support social welfare programs, and other projects that have a direct impact on the community.

In conclusion, while it is true that college graduates earn higher salaries than less well-educated individuals, they should pay the full cost of their study. Paying for their education will motivate them to work harder, ensure that they take the education seriously, and ensure that taxpayers' money is used in the most efficient way possible.",1
"There are many kinds of enjoyable educational activities. Completing a science experiment is the most enjoyable activity. it's the most enjoyable activity because doing a science experiment teaches kids to have more responsiblity on completing something. it teaches them to work hard together and have responsibility. My favorite thing about doing a science experiment is teamwork. I think that working together is important because it teaches kids to bond like family,talk to each other about it, and learn what mistake you made about it. Even if you don't make a mistake you still learn different things at the end, like bonding and learning how the experiment was supposed to be done.

The activity is enjoyable because my friends and I get to do experiments together as a group. We assign a person to do a different task so everyone can work. Our teacher tells us to clean up after ourselves for her next classroom so she could get more organized. Doing a science experiment is helpful because people will start to like learning about science. This activity also makes you understand better as you are doing the experiment. These are the reasons why i think completing a science experiment is a enjoyable and educational activity.",0
"Many people only seek one to two people when asking for advice or an opinion on something. Here's why you should get at least 3 opinions of advice when in need. Its better to have multiple points of view than to just ask one person and validate their opinion fully. Its easier to feel closure knowing that multiple peoples opinions align and you can trust that your correct. It isnt sensible to trust just one person and hope that theyre right instead of knowing that a group of people is right.

Its easier to rely on when you ask multiple people or friends for advice. If you ask a friend for their opinion on a project youve been doing, and they dont seem as though they arent fully sure about what theyre saying yet they still give you an answer. Would you trust their answer and do what they said? I wouldnt, thats why you should attempt to validate your friends answer by asking multiple people multiple people who are qualified and seem like they understand what theyre saying. If you do this, even though your friends answer may be correct in the first place, youll have full closure knowing that all of the people you know have different backgrounds and understand different things better than others yet all of their answers matched.

Its better to have more points of view. If you sought advice about a history essay that youve written, you would ask for the opinion of someone who has a wide knowledge of history or a history teacher. If you wanted to know if you needed to change any grammar in your essay, you would ask an English teacher or someone who has a wide knowledge of the English language. You wouldnt want to ask a history teacher about grammar in your essay. That doesnt make any sense. This is why you would want multiple people who have different backgrounds and different opinions on things. Because you can ask certain people for advice on certain issues. This helps you know that what your doing is correct knowing that in every aspect of an issue that you have a certified of educated person in that field has given you advice or theyre opinion on something.

Its always smarter to have more than one resource when you need an opinion or some advice. Suppose your doing research for an essay your writing. You come across one website that doesnt seem very factual but its views align with yours. So instead of ending your essay research there and thats all the evidence you have, you decide to leave that website and go to other websites to do research on. If you would do that with computers and research, why wouldnt you do that with people and advice? Its always better to ask multiple people for advice and opinions on something.

All in all, just ask more than one person for advice. Weve learned that its better to rely on when asking more than one person. Weve also learned that its always better to have more than one opinion from people when you have an issue. Lastly, weve learned that its always smarter to have more than one resource when you need an opinion or some advice. These are all the reasons why you should ask more than one person for advice or theyre opinion on something when you have to make a choice or have an issue.",0
"In The Challenge of Exploring Venus, many challenges of studying Venus are presented; however, the author provides many valid reasons as to why researchers should find ways to study this planet. The author describes the similarities of Venus and Earth, provides solutions to living on Venus, and expresses how researching Venus would be an advancement of the human mind.

The author supports their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit despite its dangers, by suggesting that Venus may have once been similar to Earth. The author wrote in paragraph 4, Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. By suggesting that Venus could have some answers to Earth's climate, the author provides strong support to their claim. The text also states in paragraph 4, The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author goes on to describe how Earth and Venus may have been closely related long ago. It is also mentioned that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit, which is beneficial considering the how long space travel takes. The author's claim is supported through this evidence of Venus being Earth-like at one point in time.

Another way that the author suppprts their claim is by providing some solutions to studying Venus, despite the dangers it possesses. The author writes in paragraph 5, NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. In paragraph 5, the author continues to explain how the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not go over the radiation levels on Earth. The solution that the author suggests helps support their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit by giving direct evidence as to how researchers may go about doing this.

Lastly, the author supports his/her claim by explaining how overcoming the challenge of studying Venus, would be beneficial not only to the insight of the planet, but also of human curiosity. The author says, Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The claim is strongly supported through the author's description of how studying Venus could be beneficial to the human mind. Another detail from paragraph 8 is, Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. The author supports that studying Venus would be worth overcoming the harsh conditions, as it would expand our views of imagination and innovation.

Despite all of the author's reasons for studying Venus, he/she describes how Venus has harsh conditions that must be overcome first. The text states, These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. The author expresses how Venus's conditions are far more extreme than any conditions on Earth. However, the author supports their claim by providing various reasons that support how Venus is worty of pursuit and how researchers may go about overcoming the dangers it possesses.

In order to support his/her claim, the author was able to provide at least three strong reasons that show how Venus would be worth studying, even though it presents many dangers. By explaining how Venus may have once been comparable to Earth, providing solutions to current problems, and expressing the benefits of studying Venus, the author is able to strongly support his/her claim with valid evidence.",0
"As the world becomes more complex and interconnected, the importance of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is becoming increasingly evident. While specialization in one specific subject has it's advantages, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial in the long run. In this essay, I will explain why I believe this to be true.

Firstly, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows individuals to have a more comprehensive understanding of the world around them. For example, if someone only specializes in mathematics, they may not have a good understanding of history, literature, or social sciences. However, if someone has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, they can connect the dots between different fields of study and gain a more holistic view of the world. This can be especially useful in fields such as business, where understanding the interplay between different factors is crucial.

Secondly, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make individuals more adaptable and versatile. In today's rapidly changing world, it is important to be able to adapt to new situations and learn new skills quickly. If someone only specializes in one specific subject, they may struggle to adapt to new situations that require knowledge outside of their area of expertise. However, if someone has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, they are more likely to be able to adapt to new situations and learn new skills quickly.

Finally, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make individuals more well-rounded and interesting. People who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects are often able to engage in a wide range of conversations and have a more diverse range of interests. This can make them more interesting to talk to and can help them build stronger relationships with others.

Of course, there are some advantages to specializing in one specific subject. For example, someone who specializes in medicine will likely have a deeper understanding of the human body than someone who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. However, I believe that the advantages of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects outweigh the advantages of specialization.

In conclusion, I believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows individuals to have a more comprehensive understanding of the world around them, makes them more adaptable and versatile, and makes them more well-rounded and interesting. While specialization in one specific subject has it's advantages, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial in the long run.",1
"Fashion has long been seen as a form of self-expression, allowing people to express themselves in ways they otherwise could not. However, what often goes unrecognized is the potential fashion holds to impact our environment. Sustainable fashion – clothing crafted from eco-friendly materials and ethical production methods – can provide an alternative approach that reduces its environmental footprint while maintaining style and quality. Sustainable fashion begins with the materials used for production, often focusing on natural resources over synthetic or petroleum-based items. Fabrics such as hemp and organic cotton are produced without chemical fertilizers or pesticides—resulting in healthier soils where plants grow naturally—while recycled fibers such as polyester also help reduce waste sent to landfills. Additionally, sustainable garments are designed with longevity in mind; classic silhouettes that won't go out of style easily allow shoppers to wear their clothes season after season instead of throwing them out when trends shift. The second aspect of sustainable fashion is fair labor practices during production, which means living wages and safe working conditions for employees involved in making the garments. Companies using these standards tend to produce fewer pieces but higher quality products since workers have more time and attention devoted to construction details than those who work for brands using traditional fast fashion methods (where laborers are paid minimally). Moreover, when companies use eco-friendly dyes along with other processes like waterless dyeing powered by solar energy—it further shows how committed they are towards creating clothing lines responsibly under ethical conditions!. Finally, it's important to note that investing in sustainable fashion doesn't just benefit the planet; it also benefits you personally too! By choosing clothes made from high-quality materials like natural fabrics versus synthetic ones (which tend not be very breathable), you're ensuring comfortability against all weather elements throughout seasons – plus many styles come at competitive price points so it’s easier than ever before! Not only do these pieces last longer because they're better constructed than mass produced",1
"The author supports his idea by adding tons of pro-Venus exploration details throughout the passage. Multiple reasons where given such as comparing Venus to Earth, looking back at the two planets history, and also shared natural events. All are things that push us to keep observing Venus even with difficult conditions.

In the fourth paragraph of the article, the author talks about how Venus may have once been covered in majestic oceans, and most likely able to support numerous forms of life. The author uses this to explain why astronomers are so intrigued by Venus. Even if Venus is inhospitable right now NASA would still like to explore the surface grab samples and bring them back to be tested.

Paragraph two elaborates mostly on comparing the planets Stating, Often referred to as Earth's twin Venus is the closest planent to Earth in terms of density and size. Connections and inferences can be made from this statement on how Earth and Venus might be similar. While in the 8th paragraph the author claims, Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Meaning technology should grow enough to keep us hungry for exploring Venus.

In conclusion The author wants us to keep trying to explore venus no matter the dangerous obstacle. He shows this by adding plenty of positive and interesting facts about the relationship between Earth and Venus.",0

"Have you ever woderd why the president was selected a certain way? Well i bet you did not know that it is called the electoral college. I am Going To tell you about how our president is choosen and why some people dont like thre way they are choosen.

Did you know that in the Electoral College there has to be a total of 538 Electors. Most of 270 votes are needed to elect a new president. Each canidate running for president has there own group of elector. The peresidential Election happens every four years on the tuesday after  the first monday in november. then we all vote and they do all these tallying on how much electoral votes they got. Not all people agre with the voting system some say its not what we the people really want sometimes. Some People belive that it is the Electors who get to choose.

Some people belive its not fair.

We belive its not far because the electoral are using us for our votes we dont get anything out of it. The state legislature is the one who picks the electors. They are chooseing people they knoe will not be our side. The electoral college is unfair to voters beause of the winner take all rule. The electoral college is unfair,outdated and irrational.

Electoral college method of selecting the presidents messes with potentional voters alot .The Electors Has no hope for who they are eleted  for they just do what they have to do to get there votes. Knowing there vote wll have no affect .

All electoral  college voters vote for a slate of electors who elect the president .The Electors can be anyone not gholding public office.

"First impressions are incredibly significant in our relationships with others. In my experience, our initial impressions can go a long way in dictating how we interact and interact with people in the future. For example, when I was introduced to a colleague at an event, she made a wonderful first impression by being friendly, engaging in small talk, and offering me some helpful advice. As a result, I found myself more comfortable talking to her in the future and was willing to reach out for advice on various projects.

On the other hand, a negative first impression can be difficult to overcome and can influence our perception of someone for a long time. The stories we tell ourselves about people based on first impressions can be hard to change, leading us to distancing ourselves from those we deemed unfavorable at first. 

Thus, it is clear that making a positive first impression can be incredibly important in developing and maintaining relationships with others. I believe that being conscious of our first interactions and taking the time to make a good impression can go a long way in cultivating strong relationships.",1
"There are many reasons why fewer cars are in use today than in the past. One reason is that more people are now living in cities, where they need to commute to work or to other activities. Car ownership is no longer the primary way that people commute.

Another reason is that the technology that makes cars possible has become more advanced. Cars now have more advanced engines, brakes, and other features than they did a few decades ago. This has made it more difficult for people to own and use cars.

Finally, people are more likely to use public transportation instead of owning a car. Public transportation is much cheaper than buying a car, and it is available everywhere. This makes it a more efficient way to commute than owning a car.",1
"There is no single answer to the question of whether or not men are becoming more greedy and selfish. Some people might argue that this is the case, while others might say that there has always been a certain amount of greed and selfishness in human nature. However, I believe that there are some valid reasons to believe that men are becoming more greedy and selfish.

One reason for this is the way that our society is structured. In the past, most people lived in small, close-knit communities where everyone knew each other and looked out for one another. However, in today's society, most people live in large cities where they are surrounded by strangers. This can lead to a sense of isolation and loneliness, and people may be more likely to look out for themselves and their own interests.

Another reason for the increase in greed and selfishness is the way that our economy is structured. In the past, most people worked in manual labor jobs, and they were able to earn a decent living. However, in today's economy, most jobs are in the service industry, and people are not able to earn a living wage. This can lead to a sense of desperation, and people may be more likely to take advantage of others in order to get ahead.

Finally, I think that the way that we are raised has a lot to do with the increase in greed and selfishness. In the past, children were taught to respect their elders and to look out for the well-being of their family and community. However, in today's society, children are often raised to be self-centered and to focus on their own needs. This can lead to a sense of entitlement, and people may be more likely to take advantage of others.

All of these factors together contribute to the increase in greed and selfishness in men. I believe that we need to return to older, traditional values and show respect for family and local community. This will help to create a society that is more caring and compassionate, and it will help to improve the quality of life for all people.",1
"When seeking for advice a person usually asks multiple people instead of just one, why is that? I believe its because they want to hear multiple experiences, opinions, and options to help them figure out what to do in that situation.

Whenever someone is stuck in a situation, it's best to tell them about your experience that you've had on the matter to help guide them to a better decision and not a bad one. Even if it's just a similar experience it could still help a lot when someone has no clue on what to do in that situation. Telling someone about something that has happened before is good because it helps them keep in mind a few things so that they don't do the same mistakes or the mistakes that were avoided. Experiences are good advice because they help inform others of things that they could be weary of and lead them to a better solution from different perspectives.

In a difficult situation it's great to give your opinion on the matter at hand. Whenever you give your opinion it could make you think of the different outcomes of the choices you have in your situation. For example if you were debating on getting toys or candy. The candy is delicious and sweet, but you can't play with it, where as the toys you can have fun with them and play with someone else, but they aren't edible and sweet. With opinions come different outcomes and thoughts about the matter which makes great advice from other people.

Perspective is an important thing because its the way you perceive something, which is why a person will ask multiple people for their experiences and opinions. Because of different perspectives a person would hear from others opinions and experiences, they would turn that into options. Options give a person a wider span of solutions that they could use which makes asking multiple people helpful to them. Perspective and options come from experiences and opinions from others that helps the, find a better solution from others advice.

Great advice can be created from experiences and opinions for the matter at hand. They help inform and persuade one to the better decision in a situation. With many different experiences and opinions from others creates options which helps find a solution in the situation that they're in. The reason a person would ask for advice from multiple people is because they want to hear from different perspectives and create options for themselves from experience and opinions from others to help their situation or find a solution.",0
"Whether or not traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel depends on the individual. Some people might prefer this type of travel because it takes away the stress of having to plan everything and they can just relax and enjoy the trip.

The tour guide will take care of all the details and the traveler can just relax and enjoy the trip. This can be a good option for people who don’t like to plan or who don’t have the time to plan a trip. It can also be a good option for people who are new to travel and don’t know where to start. Traveling in a group can also be a good way to meet new people and make friends.

However, some people might prefer to plan their own trip so they can have more control over what they do and see. They might not want to be tied to a group and a schedule.

"As the world continues to evolve, we are faced with new problems and challenges that require innovative solutions. However, many people believe that the problems we face today are more complex and challenging than those of our predecessors. I disagree with this notion because history has shown that each generation has faced it's own unique set of challenges, and it is through increased knowledge and experience that we are able to find solutions to these problems.

One example of this is the issue of disease control. In the past, diseases such as smallpox, tuberculosis, and polio were widespread and deadly, causing significant loss of life. However, with advancements in medicine and technology, we have been able to develop vaccines and treatments that have significantly reduced the impact of these diseases. Today, we face new challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have also developed new tools such as mRNA vaccines that have the potential to revolutionize disease control.

Another example is the issue of climate change. While it is true that the scale of the problem is unprecedented, we must remember that our predecessors also faced significant environmental challenges such as deforestation, soil degradation, and pollution. Through increased knowledge and experience, we have been able to develop new technologies such as renewable energy sources and more efficient transportation systems that can help reduce our carbon footprint.

Moreover, technology has played a significant role in solving some of the most complex problems of our time. In the past, communication was limited to physical letters and telegrams, making it difficult to share information and coordinate efforts across long distances. Today, we have access to a wide range of communication technologies such as email, video conferencing, and social media that facilitate collaboration and problem-solving.

Furthermore, increased globalization has enabled us to tackle problems on a global scale. For example, the United Nations was established in 1945 to promote international cooperation and address global challenges such as poverty, hunger, and conflict. Through initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals, we have been able to work together to address these issues and make progress towards a more sustainable future.

In conclusion, while it may seem that the problems we face today are more complex and challenging than those of our predecessors, history has shown that each generation has faced it's own unique set of challenges. It is through increased knowledge and experience that we are able to find solutions to these problems. Therefore, we should approach each challenge with an open mind and a willingness to learn, knowing that we have the tools and resources to overcome even the most daunting obstacles.",1
"Most people find that when they are faced with a hard decision, they seek advice from their peers. But why do we do this? As humans we are natural team workers this means whenever we are come in contact with a problem, or choice we work together to figure out the best possible out come. I believe that this is a very good trait to have because when we have a choice to make we learn the different perspectives of your friends, peers and learn all the mistakes and choices not to make.

Learning different perspectives when making a decision is very beneficial to you. You can find out all of the pros and good outcomes like money, seeing new places or you could learn all the cons like spending less time with family and loved ones, or being stressed out. I believe it knowing different perspectives and views becomes very useful and helpful when making sure that your choice will ultimately lead you to happiness. However you still need to be educated on all the ways to keep out of trouble and in check by learning all the mistakes and errors you can make when making a choice.

In the process of making a decision discovering all the areas where mistakes and errors can be made is imperative. learning how to go over every small detail could play a big part in your final decision like going over how much free time you will have, if you wont be dumped with work constantly. Learning how to handle situations with communication and problem solving skills will help you indefinitely when coming to a conclusion. Listening to other peoples mistakes also helps you decide when to actually confirm and make your choice because some people wait to long or they make their decision to fast and it ends up not working out in their favor. this also another reason why I strongly believe that taking advice from your peers when making a decision is a very important part of the process.

The decision making process while being extremely difficult is very important you make decisions everyday of your life like what your going to eat, what you are going to wear but some of your decisions might be more important. When it come to those big decisions, life changing decisions i believe that you should tackle those on your own but with your friends, family and experienced personnel. Taking advice helps change the way you think and sometimes chnages your whole mindset, in making a decision knowing every possible outcome and point of view could be the difference of your life being really awesome or it being misserable and depressing. Thats why I believe seeking advice is super beneficial when coming to a conclusion.",0

People who were sufing the web , JPL mention on the web that the face is just a natural landform. The planet had to be looked at twice to prove there is no civilazation on Mars.

The face of the pop icon starred in many things. It has been starred in things like hollywood films, radio talk shows, books, magacines, and even frocery stores. It has been in Grocery line for 25 years. People think the face is a bona fide evidence of life on Mars. They also think of a ancient civilazation on Mars.

While people were suffing on the web, JPL anounced that the face on Mars is just a normal landform. Not everyone was satisfide with the announcement. They still believe of ancient civilazation on Mars. The camera on boradhad to peer through the clouds to see the face.

Perhaps alien marks were hidden by haced siad by skeptices. Yet there is no proof at all aliens did it.

"According to Thomas Jefferson: Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. What he wanna said is that if we are always working and never have free time we will accomplish so much more. We could see that why he is saying this because he is a hard working man and look at what he have done to the world, there is nothing wrong for working hard. But if we are always working and don't spent time for ourselves or time with family then you could accomplish more but you will suffer a lot more for that successful.

For example, when we work hard and don't spent time for our self or we don't have any private time to relax and stop thinking about work, we will get stress and stress led to a lot of thing like can't sleep at night,depressed,or maybe can't eat well. So we definitely have to manage time well between work and time for yourself to maintain doing good work and have a good and healthy life. Like another scientist that work hard like Thomas Edison, his name is Albert Einstein, he work really hard but don't manage time well so he have barely sleep a day. Some even said he only sleep 3 hours a day, and the consequence is he died at the age of 60 because of sickness and he even have autism when he stay awake for too long and talking to his own self. That is why we have to have free time because we don't want to get stress and get tired of our work so it can led to quit job or we getting fired.

Another important thing is that we need to spent time well with our family too because family is where we have the most support from and also the reason why we work for so hard if we don't have time for our family then they will leave us and then, by that time we gonna work and live so hard because we are lonely. And we might suicide or getting depressed and lead us to drugs. Family is what matter in our life and that is why we have to spent good time for them so they can be with us and support us when we need to so we can work harder for. I have an uncle in Generic_City, he is a successful business man, he work for a well-known medical company and and owner of a market but to pay for what he own is his time for his family. He start work at 5 a. m and go home at 11p. m and he never have time for his family. That is why during this summer his wife leave him, his daughter don't wanna see him anymore because he was never there for her, and his son just never call or visit him. Now he is 40 and he is a very success person but after all of that he is still and lonely old man. This is why we need to spent time for our family because after we work so hard in our lives but we dont have family after that we are just lonely peoples that have no one to make our life happy til the rest of it.

i think Thomas Edison quote have nothing wrong with it, and it is true that human can do so more if they are not have idle time. But if we don't have those idle time we will soon face with stress, disease, depressed, loneliness and also suicide, so why we work so hard and don't have free time so we die in miserable ways when we can work hard and play hard too and enjoy our life in a really good way.",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping it as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are valid concerns regarding the fairness and flaws of the Electoral College, I believe that it provides certain benefits that are crucial for our democracy.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees a certainty of outcome. In the event of a dispute, it is less likely to face challenges compared to a direct popular vote. As seen in the 2012 election, President Obama received a smaller share of the popular vote but a larger share of the electoral vote, ensuring a clear victory. This system reduces the chances of an electoral tie and the resulting complications that a run-off election would entail.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a president who represents the entire nation. Since no single region has enough electoral votes to secure the presidency, candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This promotes a national campaign strategy that ensures candidates reach out to diverse regions and communities, rather than solely focusing on populous areas or swing states. It is important for a president to have broad-based support across the country in order to address the needs and interests of all citizens.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to target swing states. Swing states, or toss-up states, play a critical role in deciding the outcome of an election. This means that voters in these states receive more attention from candidates and are likely to be more thoughtful and engaged in the electoral process. By giving greater weight to the concerns and preferences of swing state voters, the Electoral College ensures that the outcome is decided by those who are most invested and informed.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance to the political influence of large and small states. While the popular vote may favor highly populous states, the Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a significant say in the election. This is important for maintaining a sense of equality and fairness among states, preventing candidates from solely catering to the needs of a few densely populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which may complicate the electoral process. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This avoids the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections that could potentially undermine the stability and efficiency of the democratic system.

While there are critics who argue for the abolition of the Electoral College, I firmly believe that it serves as a safeguard for our democracy. It ensures that every region has a voice in the election, promotes trans-regional appeal, and avoids the complications and uncertainties that can arise from a direct popular vote system.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I encourage you to carefully weigh the benefits and drawbacks of the Electoral College before making any decisions that could significantly impact our democratic process.

Sincerely,

"Do we have to live other people experiences?

If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.

People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. I don't really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.

If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.

Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.

Don't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.

Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know. Fight for what you really want no matter what comes next.",0
"Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of technology in our lives? This modern age has ushered in an unprecedented number of gadgets and tools to make life easier, faster and more efficient. But are these advances truly beneficial, or are we becoming too reliant on them?. The convenience that comes with technology is undeniable. Just a few short decades ago, tasks like research or communication that would take hours can now be accomplished in minutes with a smartphone or laptop. We're able to access instantaneous information through powerful search engines, communicate quickly and easily via email, text messaging and social media networks; all without having to leave the comfort of our homes! Technology has also enabled businesses to become more productive than ever before — computers automate much of their workflows while online stores enable swift transactions between buyers and sellers. . However, this increased interconnectivity brings its own set of risks as well. We've seen how cyber criminals have taken advantage of people's lack of security awareness when using internet-connected devices: from stealing credit card data to launching large-scale ransomware attacks on corporate networks. Plus there's the problem of digital addiction — according to recent studies conducted by Stanford University's Center for Internet & Society, nearly 70% percent Americans have experienced some form disconnection anxiety due being away from their tech devices for even just a few hours per day!. Moreover, it's important not forget about basic human interaction which is often put aside due spending so much time glued onto a screen instead real life conversations with family members who live nearby or friends across town (or even around world). With kids playing video games rather than going outside enjoying fresh air outdoors; adults getting lost scrolling through endless feeds news articles rather than connecting co-workers over coffee break; it could seem like society sleepwalking into virtual paradise where any semblance authenticity gets buried under layers ones & zeros…. Clearly there must be balance struck between utilizing technological advances making best use them without becoming overly dependent",1
"Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote “To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment” is truly meaningful and strikes a chord with many people. In today’s world, one is constantly bombarded with various pressures and expectations, such as achieving certain goals, getting into certain colleges, or succeeding in particular career paths. Although these expectations can be beneficial in pushing individuals to reach their goals, oftentimes, it can be immensely difficult to stand out and remain true to oneself amidst these pressures.

For those who take the initiative to forge their own path and not get trapped by feeling the need to be the same as everyone else, it is a great accomplishment. For example, deciding to pursue an unconventional career path despite the disapproval of family and friends, or exploring a side hustle despite the fear of failure all embody this quote’s sentiment. It is a difficult process, but a rewarding one, and it takes immense strength and courage to be able to resist the urge to conform.

In a way, Emerson’s quote serves as a reminder that one should strive to be the best version of oneself and never lose sight of the unique individual qualities that make oneself special and entire. At the same time, it also serves as a source of celebration for anyone who has gone through their own valiant journey to stay true to themselves and their larger goals in the face of challenges.",1
"Many conspiracy theorists say that The Face On Mars is proof of alien life. Some even say that NASA is trying to hide evidence of aliens. The face is nothing more then an illusion though, caused by shadows. Although technology was not advanced when the first photo was published, more recent pictures have proven that this is nothing more then a crater with shadows, creating eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

In 1976 when the first photo was released people quickly began to theorize that alien life was on Mars, but this is simply not true. The picture was taken in low resolution and was very blurry. The Viking 1 Spacecraft was circling the planet searching for landing sites for The Viking 2, when a landform that resembled an enormous face was spotted. This enormous two mile long face is nothing more then a mesa.

In 1998 a new picture of the mesa was released, but people were still not satisfied. Since it was winter while the mission was launched there was a thick haze over the Red Planet. Many think that NASA is trying to hide evidence that there IS lifeforms on other planets, but this is not true. We as scientists wish to share information on space with the public, but we will not spread false rumors about alien lifeforms when there are none.

On April 8, 2001 we launched another mission to take a more high-resolution photo. Since it was summer there were no clouds to hide the mesa. Mars Global Surveyor rotated 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view. They then took a photo using the camera at maximum resolution. After all the hype about alien life on Mars since the first photo was released, it was clear to see that the Face was nothing but a mesa.

After years of research and three missions to take photos of Mars, it is clear to see that the Face was no evidence of life on another planet. The Face is very similar to something like on Earth. Although the mesa has not proven there is life beyond Earth we as humans still do not know what is beyond.",0
"In recent years, the use of virtual reality (VR) technology in education has become increasingly popular. This essay will explore why VR is an effective teaching tool, discuss how it can be used to enhance learning experiences and outline the potential challenges associated with its use. First and foremost, VR provides a more immersive experience than traditional teaching methods, allowing students to interact directly with a 3D environment or simulation as if they were actually there. As opposed to just reading about something or watching a video demonstration, students are able to engage in subject material through hands-on activities that provide tangible results when completed correctly. In addition, because these simulations depict real life scenarios and environments accurately enough for users to feel like they’re truly “in” them – not just looking at them on screen – students are able to observe firsthand the consequences of their actions within those parameters; this encourages critical thinking skills and allows them to better understand topics from different perspectives. Furthermore, by providing realistic visuals that draw learners into material faster than text-based content ever could , teachers find themselves free from monotonous lectures - instead being enabled by VR-driven lessons plans that keep pupils engaged mentally throughout each class period. When it comes down using VR technology as part of educational efforts effectively though, teachers must incorporate certain strategies into their lesson plans so as ensure maximum absorption of knowledge without overwhelming pupils: utilizing detailed instruction manuals prior starting any activity allows learners to gain familiarity with provided tools beforehand; while beginning smaller projects before moving onto larger ones prevents boredom setting in during extended courses; furthermore having participants work together rather than alone also helps foster teamwork capabilities while simultaneously engaging minds actively - all thanks due its ability quickly break down barriers between members that might otherwise take much longer establish naturally. . Despite all these advantages however there remain some inherent limitations when it comes incorporating Virtual Reality technologies into everyday classroom settings: Perhaps most notably cost often presents itself problem given fact current technological advancements require relatively expensive hardware maintain quality",1
"Support for the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [State Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system as the method for electing the President of the United States, and I urge you to consider the importance of maintaining this system in our democratic process. The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote, serves as a vital safeguard for our nation's diverse interests.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. Unlike a popular vote, where disputes over the validity of votes can arise and potentially delay the election result, the Electoral College ensures that the winner's share of electoral votes usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes and allows for a smoother transition of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the notion of having a president who represents the interests of all Americans. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages candidates to campaign across the nation and consider the concerns and needs of voters from different regions. With the winner-take-all method, swing states become crucial in determining the election outcome. This means that these states receive more attention and resources from candidates, resulting in more informed and engaged voters.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives weight to large states and ensures that their interests are not overshadowed by smaller states. The apportionment of electors based on the number of representatives in the House and Senate means that large states have more influence in the electoral process. This balance is especially important as it prevents the marginalization of large states due to the constitutional apportionment of the Senate. By maintaining this balance, the Electoral College system provides adequate representation for citizens in both small and large states.

Lastly, the Electoral College system eliminates the need for runoff elections, which can be time-consuming, costly, and complex. Runoff elections often occur when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, leading to prolonged uncertainty and potential divisiveness. The Electoral College, on the other hand, nearly always produces a clear winner, preventing the need for an additional round of voting.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as concerns over fairness and voter turnout, it is essential to emphasize the multiple benefits provided by this system. As was evident in the 2012 election, the Electoral College encourages engagement from thoughtful voters in swing states, promotes representation for large states, and ensures a decisive outcome without the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Electoral College system continues to serve as a fundamental pillar of our democratic process. It encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, protects the interests of all Americans, and provides certainty in the election outcome. It is my sincere hope that you will take these arguments into consideration and support the continued use of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your dedication to serving our great state.

Sincerely,

"The discussion about the impact of technology on modern society often centers around the idea of convenience. We now have access to a wealth of information and services that make everyday life easier than ever before, from ordering takeout food to streaming movies at home. However, there is something else to consider when it comes to how technology has changed our lives; its influence on human connection and social interaction. Technology has drastically altered how we communicate with each other, for better or worse depending on who you ask. Through platforms like Skype, FaceTime, and Zoom video chat services people can remain constantly connected regardless of where they are in the world - eliminating physical barriers between individuals while challenging traditional communication boundaries such as time zones and distance-based relationships. This newfound connectivity mixes both positive impacts (being able to speak face-to-face with loved ones across great distances) as well as negative effects (a decreased need for interpersonal conversation). As humans we tend towards comfort in any situation. Technology makes this even more true by allowing us to do most things without leaving home: shop online, watch television programs via streaming service apps instead of live TV broadcasts, even order groceries when we don’t want to leave the house! While it’s easy just give into these gadgets that help us get what we need faster and more conveniently - rather than taking the effort required in past generations - downplaying their potential long term effects would be dangerous for our mental health and wellbeing if left unchecked over extended periods of time. With technology increasingly becoming ingrained into everyday life for many people around the world, tackling issues such as loneliness due insufficient real human contact should be addressed sooner rather than later if communities wish to keep healthy connections alive among its members from generation-to-generation in years ahead. . When all is said done though one thing remains clear: technological advances will always bring with them a wide variety changes socially speaking – some beneficial others not so much – but ultimately individuals must decide which",1
"Car emissions are very deadly and dangerous. They can be lethal to humans, and also dangerous to the environment. It can lead to big environmental issues like global warming, holes in the ozone, and air pollution. Many ignore the fact or are oblivious to it, but driving hurts our environment just for a little bit of convenience. Are cars doing more harm than good?

Cars have a convenient way of getting us to our destination faster but at the cost of our precious environment. We use our cars sometimes without thinking twice of what the actual after effect is. Paris is a city that has had almost, if not the worst, smog levels in all of europe. It has 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter due to the majority of cars which have diesel powered engines. Air pollution doen't just effect our atmosphere, it slowly kills, if not severly injures, animals and people. It hurts us by causing major damage to our lungs and respiratory system.

Greenhouse gases are another major thing in car emissions. Greenhouse gases are gases that keep or trap heat on earth to keep us from going into another ice age. A decent amount is good and is used to do its job, but when you have too much then the globe starts to increase in temperature. Antarctica, as you know, is made of ice. when ice gets to a certain temperature it starts to turn into a liquid. So when antarctica starts to melt into the sea, the general ocean level will rise, causing sea level cities, states, and countries start to flood with salty ocean water. If we cut down on gas or diesel car travels, the and greenhouse production rate would slow down and so will the rising temperature of the earth decreasing the speed of the melting arctic.

Cars are a very important and convenient way of travel but can be very deadly to us humans and tne earth we live on. Because we use them everyday doesn't mean that we can not cut down or change our ways of transpertation. Cars give off many harmful toxins and gases that we can, but refuse to control. we can cut down on the majority of the waste by limiting our car trips distance wise and based on how many times you leave the driveway. a simple change as in riding a bike or walking or even only going out when needed can slow down the speed of global warming and even drop the levels of air pollution. A little change can maybe just save the earth from another flood that can wipe out humainity.",0
"I believe that drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. This is because it is a major distraction and can lead to accidents, which can cause harm to both the driver and other people on the road.

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving can be very distracting. It takes the driver's attention away from the road, and they may not be able to react quickly enough to avoid an accident. For example, if a driver is texting while driving, they may not see a pedestrian crossing the road or a car stopping in front of them. This can lead to a serious accident, which can cause injury or even death.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving can also be dangerous because it can cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle. If a driver is talking on the phone, they may not be able to react quickly enough to avoid a sudden obstacle in the road. This can cause the driver to swerve or lose control of the vehicle, which can lead to a serious accident.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It is a major distraction and can lead to accidents, which can cause harm to both the driver and other people on the road. It is important to stay focused on the road and avoid any distractions while driving, to ensure the safety of everyone on the road.",1
"In our ever-changing world, one of the most remarkable advances is that of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has been around for many years, but it has only recently started to become a part of everyday life. AI can be seen in everything from voice assistants and online chatbots to facial recognition software, autonomous cars, and much more. The potential applications for AI are vast and fascinating. One area where AI is already playing an important role is healthcare. By leveraging huge amounts of data collected from various sources such as patient records and medical research papers, advanced algorithms can detect patterns that may not have previously been noticed by doctors or nurses. This allows them to make better decisions when diagnosing diseases or administering treatments tailored specifically to each patient’s individual needs. Furthermore, with the help of machine learning techniques combined with natural language processing capabilities, medical professionals can quickly access relevant knowledge without having to manually search through countless resources – allowing them more time to spend on providing direct care for their patients. Another exciting application of AI technology is its use in robotic surgery systems which allow surgeons greater accuracy during complex procedures than would otherwise be possible with manual operation alone – reducing risks associated with surgeries while offering similarly safe results as traditional methods do. With sensors located inside the robot arms equipped with smart tools that sense force feedback from tissue structures they come into contact within the body cavity being operated upon; this helps ensure minimal disruption or damage occurs throughout a procedure in a way no human surgeon could match directly managing every movement made by these robots themselves due to their precision capabilities exceeding any doctor’s capability alone further increasing surgical success rates around the world compared before its introduction!. . Overall then it's clear that artificial intelligence holds tremendous promise for both improving healthcare outcomes and transforming how we approach surgical operations like never before - whether those changes result from automating certain processes so doctors have extra time available or enabling machines capable far surpassing human abilities produced through state-of-the-art technology continues",1
"In recent years, technology has allowed us to become increasingly interconnected. We are able to communicate and collaborate with people from around the world in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. As a result, online education is becoming an increasingly popular option for students seeking higher learning opportunities without having to commit to traditional college courses. With this in mind, it is worth exploring the potential benefits of studying online versus attending classes on campus. The primary benefit of taking an online course over one offered by a physical institution is convenience. By removing the need for travel or other disruptive obligations such as family commitments or childcare, students can study at their own pace and complete assignments whenever they have free time available. Furthermore, many virtual courses provide flexible start dates so that those who want access immediately don’t have to wait until the next semester begins before applying. Additionally, advanced software tools allow instructors to track course progress in real-time and give more personalized support when needed through email contact or video conferencing sessions with classmates if desired. Another advantage of pursuing an academic degree remotely is cost savings; tuition fees tend to be lower than their on-campus counterparts due mainly to fewer overhead expenses associated with maintaining physical premises and hiring faculty members onsite. Additionally, those enrolling in certain accredited programs may also qualify for financial aid packages which could further reduce costs significantly depending on eligibility criteria met by each individual student . . Finally yet importantly , remote learners obtain access invaluable resources including lectures recorded by experts in various fields , podcasts about relevant topics related directly or indirectly towards subjects being studied , interactive simulations used during experiments within labs studies etc .Such type of multimedia provides additional insights into subject areas not easily obtained from textbooks alone . Moreover multiple platforms like discussion forums , chat rooms help students exchange information ideas among themselves thus fostering collaboration within academia . . Overall online education offers unique advantages compared against conventional classroom settings: greater convenience along with cost savings and easier access valuable educational material all combine together making",1
"The author describes Making Mona Lisa Smile and how a new technology called the Facial Action Cording System enables compures to identify human emotions. Because the author is trying to tell us how the technology can make us feel differents emotions. In this article we can find too many differents emotions that the Mona Lise had. And how the techonology can do it too.

For example my first evidence that i found in this article is when said that Mona Lise is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. So, is trying to tell us that to making Mona Lise smile can be a difficult way, because she had too many differents emotions at the same time,but nothing is impossible. But also the people trying to describe a new technology to identify humans emotion. The new technology is called FACS ( Facial Action Coding System). This is the new technolody that the author wanted to used to find the humans emotions, , and see which one of the two option that they had can be more easy or more faster to find the human emotions.

My other example that also i found in this article is when said that according to the new computers softward can recogniza emotion. The softward is the least innovation from Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Backman institute for advanced science at the University Illions. The author is trying to tell us to describes the new tecnology was little complicated because with he wanted to describe that technology to see if will be more easy to identify the emotions. Also in this article said that the process begings when the computer construct a 3D computer of the face, all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. That why i think that describes that new techology wasn't eassy because the new technology need to identify all about human.

In my conclution is about the computers and how Mona Lise demostration was really intended to bring a smiles to your face, while it show you just how the computers can do. If you smile when a Web ad appears to your screen , a similar somputer could regnize too. Like said Dr. Haunght he predicted that the computer could recognize when a students or another person is becoming confused or sad. And acording to the Facia Feeback theory emotion, moving ourfacaisl muscles can make us feel not only expresss motion, but also can even help us to feel like some differents emotions.",0
"One place in the world I would like to visit is Generic_City,Peru. The reason I want to visit Peru is because my grandma and my dad live there, I haven't seen them in 7 years and I want to see them at least one more time until I grow up. Once I arrive I want to spend some time with my grandma and my dad to catch up what has happened over the years. I also want to go to the beach and the pool and go to the park with my whole family and have an awesome picnic and we would make smores and tell creepy stories, also I would want to get a tan,but one of the things i haven't done ever in my life is skydiving I know it would be really scary but it would also be really fun to see their reaction when the jump out of a plane it would be really funny to watch it over and over again. The last place I would visit is machu picchu because it is such a clam place. At night you see the stars and in the morning u see the sunset rising. I would never want to leave .To sum up i would have an amazing time with my family.

Because I would visit Peru I would see my cousins,brothers,grandma,aunts,uncle and my dad I would see them everyday and we would spend some family time together.

When I go to the beach we are going to have a picnic we are going to go swim also we are going to play some games we are going to have a blast !

I am going to visit machu picchu. The first thing i would do is watch the sunset, ride camels,ride horses and take awesome pictures.",0
"Successful people are often thought of as those who have achieved a certain level of success in their lives. This success can come in many forms, such as financial success, career success, or even personal success. However, it is often said that successful people are those who are willing to try new things and take risks. I agree with this statement, as taking risks and trying new things can lead to greater success in life.

One of the main reasons why successful people take risks and try new things is because it allows them to expand their knowledge and skills. For example, if someone is successful in their career, they may decide to take a risk and try something new, such as starting their own business. This new venture may require them to learn new skills, such as marketing, accounting, or even coding. By taking this risk and trying something new, they are able to expand their knowledge and skills, which can lead to even greater success in the future.

Another reason why successful people take risks and try new things is because it allows them to stay ahead of the competition. For example, if someone is successful in their career, they may decide to take a risk and try something new, such as introducing a new product or service. By taking this risk and trying something new, they are able to stay ahead of their competition and potentially gain a competitive advantage. This can lead to greater success in the long run.

Finally, taking risks and trying new things can also lead to greater personal satisfaction. For example, if someone is successful in their career, they may decide to take a risk and try something new, such as taking a vacation to a new country. By taking this risk and trying something new, they are able to experience new cultures, meet new people, and explore new places. This can lead to greater personal satisfaction and a greater sense of accomplishment.

In conclusion, I believe that successful people take risks and try new things because it allows them to expand their knowledge and skills, stay ahead of the competition, and gain greater personal satisfaction. Taking risks and trying new things can be difficult, but it can also lead to greater success in the long run. Therefore, I believe that successful people should be willing to take risks and try new things in order to achieve even greater success.",1
"There are a lot of things that develop and hold a Electoral College together. There are also a lot of down falls to the Electoral College. Every state has 1 House of Representative plus 2 of your Senators in the Electoral College. There are a total of 538 people but 270 of them is the majority vote that wins. There are a total of 5 reasons why we have to keep this method to choosing the president. The 5 ways are Certainty of outcome,Everyone's President,Swing States,Big States and Avoid Run-Off Elections.

The main reason we have a Electoral College is so they have a right way to choose a president. The main reason for this is so that we dont leave our electing in the hands of foriegn people/immiagrants. The is what the president needs to get elected in the electoral college. There are still a lot of down falls to this method of the electoral college though. One of these issues is at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voter. This means winner takes all which is they only focus on the bigger states and not the smaller ones because the bigger states have bigger population which means they have more in the electoral college. Another issue with this method is that the person thats running for president might get the popularity vote but still not win. See everyone that votes isnt really voting directly for the president, the people who really count is the electoral college. In order to win the vote you have to convice the electoral college and thats not always easy. So remember just because you won popular vote doesnt mean you won the majority of the electoral vote.

There are 5 reasons why we keep this method of electing the president. The first reason is Certainty of Outcome. This means it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote. Which really means the candidates share to the other people in the Electoral college there share of the popular vote and thats how they vote. The second reason is Everyone's President. This is basically shows that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that no region such as south,northwest,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The third resone to keeping these methods is Swing States. This tells me that its the winner takes all method. The fourth method why we should keep these methods is the Big States. This explains that the Electoral College restores some of the wieght in the political balance. this means that the bigger states get a big advantage in the electoral because the people that get elected into office there is based off of population so they have an advantage. THe bigger states get more attention from the candates then the smaller states do. The final reason why we should keep this method of voting is Avoid Run-Off Elections. This means the Electoral College aviods the problem of Elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast. This means no pressure for candidates when they win majority of the votes cast.

There are many ways to develop and to hold the Electoral College together. There are many ways that it falls apart and has it flaws but its the best way for our econany to vote for president. If you think about it if we just did popularity vote that would be like leading our hands into a world of immigrates who know a very little. There a lot of rules for our Electoral process buyt its the best way and the only way we have to becoming a better place. Dont forget to look at the 5 reasons we keep this the way it is.",0
"Yes, I think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are many reasons why this might be true. One reason is that young people are busy with their own lives and they do not have time to help others. Another reason is that young people are not taught about the benefits of helping others. They only learn about the risks and the consequences of not helping. This is not good for the community because it can lead to problems. It can also lead to the development of bad habits. For example, people might start to resent the community because they do not get help from the community.",1
"The system of the Electoral College is a widely argued debate as to if it should be continued or if it should be gotten rid of. The electoral system shouldn't be used as a system of voting, who honestly wants to vote for someone who will vote for you, and if we are truly a state thats votes for its own president then why doesn't the popular vote count as the official vote?

The Electoral College is a system that is rather unfit as a system of the people's voting. When you vote for your president, you're really just voting for who you think should vote for them. The article Does the Electoral College Work? states, ...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for you candidate's electors. The Constitution states that we are able to vote for our president, but then what do you call this? This is not an example of what America stands for, and this is certainly not the voting system that is described by our nation's properties. There is another issue with this violation of rights concerning our voting system, it's how the Electoral College votes and how dependable they are. The article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong. talks about how you can't control who the electoral you chose vote for. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. This statement helps prove that the president you may want may not even get you vote. The Electoral College not only takes away your right to assuringly vote for the president of your choice, but it also takes away right personal voting right as an American. Don't let someone else detain your freedom of speech, let you personal voice be heard by the people.

While the Electoral College may seem like a sure fire way to assure that we get a president, that doesn't really mean the majority wants that president. Think about it, we don't always get the president we voted for. Popular vote doesn't really matter, it's like saying you voice doesn't matter to the government. They took away the right as an American they gave you in the first place. Popular vote should replace the Electoral College. There have been instances where the popular vote reined supreme, but the Electoral College didn't agree. In the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong it mentions an election where Al Gore lost even though he won the popular vote. ...according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency... This helps show the people that it seems our vote isn't what is truly important, it's only what the Electoral College does that makes a true impact on choosing of president for the next two years. It's even stated in the very same article that, ...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. If our vote truly matters then why not vote on keeping the Electoral College in play or getting rid of the flawed system once and for all.

The Electoral college is claimed to keep the voting system in line and prevent major mess, however this is not truly the case. There will still be flaws, but this is not the correct way to fix it. Listening strictly to the people's vote is what Amercia was built on and as an American I would like to see a change and let my voice be heard. If I want to vote I will vote, I don't want to vote on someone voting for me.

The Electoral College is unfair, unjust, and unamerican. The system takes away our right to vote for who we want not who we want to vote for us. If you are a true American you will understand why I know this is flawed. The Electoral College is not a proper way to handle our votes it must be a vote decided completely by the people of Amercia.",0
"Would you be able to give your car up? Having to ride with strangers on the bus to reduce pollution. Would you be able to pay the fines after driving your car?

Most people nowadays wouldn't give up their car to save their life. We've been so used to having cars since they came out we've just forgotten what It's like using our bikes, or walking from point A to point B. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move here Says passage number 1 paragraph 3. Imagine selling your car just to live somewhere else. Not having a car would for one, reduce the amount of pollution in the area, but two, also reduce the amount of stress. Come to think of it, it would also lessen the number of deaths. When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. Said Heidrun Walter. She uses her bike to get from place to place. Which could e a lot more healthy. We most likely wouldn't have so many obese people.

A lot of people have bad health just because of where they live. All these cars polluting the area does not help the fact that most people with asthma, It's just slowly killing them because their lungs can't get enough air as it is.  Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog... the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. The gas that makes these cars zoom around the world is hurting the enviroment. Polluting our streets, making it so foggy out that drivers can hardly see. Not only does diesel fuel hurt our ecosystem, it hurts our wallets too. How much does the average person spend on gas in their lifetime? A lot, don't you think? You probably have to fill up your tank every week or so, depending how far you drive. Just think of all the other items you could buy instead of having to pay for gas. Shoot, we'd probably all be millionares if we set aside our gas money.

Death. Death is a major problem. Due to alcohol and stupidity plus cars equal not very good outcome. Most people aren't even safe when the drive so it's not like cars can drive themselves and not get in an accident. Police were starting to fine people if their license plate was even or odd, depending on the day. Would you really want to be fined for driving a car? Save the time and effort on your precious little car and ride your bike to the grocery store. Or instead of driving your dog to the dog park, walk him or her there. Maybe instead of running an aron in the car why don't you actually RUN the aron.

Cars cause a lot of problems in most of our cities, countries, states, islands, whever. It would be ten times easier just to tone it down a notch.",0
"should we be honest or not? We should be honest because people that you know very well and you think that they would never lie to you thta's going to hurt you the must. and if you are not honest people would never believe you.

People in this world lie alot and they are not honest. who are we going to trust if people are not honest .if you lie all the time people will turn their backs on you and nobody is going to help you out if you a problem. when you lie to peolpe one way or another they will find out so be honest all the time. and if you lie to the people you love the most that's just sad because they give you so much incouregmentfor eveything.

I think that if you are not honest you shouldn't be trusted by anyone. you give all of your trust to that person and you say don't tell anyone, if that person does it anyways are you going to trust them again, I wouldn't. if you want to be trusted you need to start from zore. so stop lieing to ever one you trust and be honest and tell the truth to every one. and be nice and don't get in trouble. if people believe on you they're going to have your back no matter what.

People in this world don't liked to be lied to. alot of people like to be trusted so be honest all the time not sometimes all the time. and by being honest it can help you out by you'er parents having trust on you making sure that you don't do bad things or say bad things. and being honest breings good things in life you can get really great jobs and be responsible with everything .

if you are honest with everyone,evryone is going to believe you all the time. and believe in everything on what you said. and if you do what you said or promis people will believe on you and give you all of the trust that you need.

I know being honest can hurt someones feelings but insted of being sad make your wake ness in to streagth. and i'm telling you ,you will feel so much better then ever. some people can be mean when being honest but turn your back on them and don't talk to them but if they change give them a chance. and don't believe on what they say about you is not being honest to them self either. so be honest all the time.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

TEACHER_NAME i agree of community service because i done it before. It's not bad and it doesn't take nothing of my time. I had to do 120 hours of community service. At first i thought it would be boring but a few days later it was fun. I had to do 120 because me and other friends did trespassing at SCHOOL_NAME. It kinda sucks because i had to go to court and my mom and dad were mad because they had to pay 200 dollars for the ticket. That wasn't cool!! Well the next day i went that same school and they told me that i couldn't be there at all! and they also said that if they see me there at that same school they would call the police on me again. That's why you shouldn't drive fast or pass red lights because they would double the money. Now i noe not to go to that school again.

"Likewise, many people belive that  Determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. By all means that by being idle you wont get much done, but if active can get a lot of more stuff done. Others belive that by being idle, you can still get anything done as much as a person that is consistently active. I strongly agree that by being active will get more tasks complete and it will be less difficult. By always having something to do, your showing everyone your character and your morals. Inactivity and idleness is not good because by not having anything to do you wont learn as much as a person that has to do majority of time. Actively participator have better improved skills then those who dont do anything.

Firstly, being active is the best goal a mind set can have. It will be less likely for one to not complete a task or struggle with a task if is idle. Always doing something no matter if you have nothing to do, shows a lot about someones motivation and actions. Especially in a work place, if your boss sees you doing nothing while there being things to do, hes going to think your inactive. By showing everyone you always have something to do, your showing them that you are capable of doing anything. Theres no task to difficult or no job to big for you to complete because you are already used of always doing something in your everyday life and while being idle from the task isnt part of your expectation or motives. If you think of always being occupied and being successful it practically the same concept just because getting task done is like you doing anything you are asked to do and being successful is like achieving your goals.

Secondly, Idle and inactivity serves a purpose when you are a 100 percent sure you can do anything when asked to. For example my dad once told me, why are you always playing video games and that why dont i go and play outside with my friends. What i told him was that i did not want to and he told me that my actions show a lot about who i am. After that he signed me up for a youth soccer team, that i played being a defender. Although i wasnt good, i started trying my best and being active with the team. Later that day my coach was talking to my dad and telling him how i was participating and doing everything he told me to do. What he also had suggested to my dad was if he can move me up to a left forward because of all the hard work and commitment i had done for the pass warm ups and practice games.

Therefore, people that are always participating you will see improvement in grades, work ethic and body structure. People that always are doing something productive in there everyday life have good grades because they are used of finishing all their work, rather then the student that doesnt do anything and idled from the class. Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. Going to the Gym doesnt only show that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do.

In conclusion, do you think always having something to do all the time shows who you really are? Participating shows a lot about a person goals and achievements. Inactive people show their lack of interest and the type of attitude shown. While a person that is consistently doing things and keeping there self occupied and does not tend to complain about what they are ever asked to do. Always doing stuff will make you want to complete more each and every time.",0
"I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. In my opinion, this is due to a variety of factors, such as the shift in population to cities, the rise in fuel efficiency and the increase in electric vehicles.

"The article The Challenge of Exploring Venus has lots of useful information about the planet venus and it's difficulty to be explored as well as why it is worth exploring despite the danger.

Even though it is dangerous to explore Venus, the article does have some good points regarding why it is worth the risk to explore it. One example from the article is in paragraph 4 which reads, Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. This excerpt helps show that Earth and Venus were quite similar at one point, making it important to explore and discover how both planets were similar, and if humans could live on Venus at some point, as well as many other unanswered questions.

Another good point that the author makes in paragraph 4 which reads, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. This part of the article helps show that there can be many practical uses for information discovered about Venus during these explorations even if there is danger involved when trying to explore.

Overall, the author has a strong argument for the benefits of exploring Venus outweighing the danger and difficulty",0
"There is no doubt that the number of cars in use will decline in the next twenty years. Several factors will contribute to this trend.

The first reason is the increasing cost of owning and operating a car. The cost of gasoline, insurance, and repairs continues to rise, while the value of cars declines. In addition, many people are choosing to live in urban areas where they do not need a car.

The second reason is the increasing availability of alternative forms of transportation. Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft are becoming more popular, and there is a growing trend of people using bicycles and public transportation.

The third reason is the increasing awareness of the negative environmental impacts of cars. Cars produce greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, and they also create air pollution that can cause health problems.

All of these factors will lead to a decline in the number of cars in use in the next twenty years.",1
"Phones & Driving

While driving you're main point of focus should be on the road. A great number of people own a cell phone and the sudden urge to use it while operating a vehicle can be very tempting. There are many reasons, opinion, and facts based on why i think people should and shouldn't use cell phones while on the road. There are pros and cons depending on the situation. Here's why i think people should not use a cellphone while driving.

Using your phone is already a distraction and driving just makes it more worse than it is. While driving you have a lot responsibilities and using a phone just makes it harder to focus. Using a phone while driving is also probably illegal. In certain cases it is highly likely that you will receive a ticket. You can easily save yourself a ticket by just waiting till you are out of the vehicle reply to a text or call. Another reason is the passengers if anyone else is in the car. It is your responsibility to keep everyone in the vehicle safe. Using a phone while driving can increase the chance of a crash by a lot putting your life and the life of the passengers at risk. You can also put pedestrians at risk if you are not paying attention. There are also some reasons why i think it can be okay sometimes for people to use cellphones while driving.

A main reason can be a emergency. Sometimes things happen at unfortunate times while you are driving, but that still is no excuse for you to use a phone while driving. Maybe waiting at the light to reply can sometimes be okay as long as you are paying attention. If you need to call or answer a call you can maybe put the phone on a mount so that your hands are still on the wheel and you still have your focus on the road. I personally know people who do this and in my opinion it's the safest way to answer the phone hands free while all your attention is still on the road. If you get a text or a call and you really can't help yourself, find somewhere to park. It doesn't take that long and it can save your life, the life of others, and reduce the chance of getting into a crash.

There's a lot of facts that show why texting and driving can be so fatal. 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the fact that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but 35% still admit to doing it, while 21% get into fatal crashes due to texting and driving. The percentage to get in a crash while texting and driving increased by 23%.

Answering a text takes your attention away for about 5 seconds and while going at 55 mph, that's enough to the length of a football field without even looking at the road. There are an endless amount of facts and statistics about this, and reading some to obtain the knowledge about this danger is great for your safety and the safety of others.

In conclusion, i don't think anyone should text and drive in under any circumstances because you are increasing the chance of a crash and risking lives. There is no excuse to why you should even pick up a phone while driving. If you absolutely have to because of an emergency or other reasons then you can park and take care of it from there. It's much safer and you can be saving lives",0
"Dear state senator,

I do not agree with the idea of the electoral college. The United States' president should be elected by popular vote and not just by a specific amount of electors. One great reason why the president of the US should be elected by popular vote is because the citizens won't really get to choose what president that they want to have for the next one or two terms. It is also unfair to the people that vote for their president (according to source 2.) We should really stick to the president being elected by popular vote.

The president should be elected by popular vote because the people are practically not voting for their president. The majority of voter aren't voting for the president, but they're voting for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president(as said in source 2.) The electors that actually elect the president can be anyone not holding public office. The citizens that vote can not always control whom their electors vote for.

It's official that the electoral college is also unfair to voters. Voters are voting for other electors to then elect the president. What if to say there was a tie after voting for the candidates? The election would be handed down to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote on the president. The electoral college is also unfair because of the win-take-all system in each state. Candidates won't stay in states where they know they a zero percent chance of winning, they'll only focus on the states with tight races.

So there is why I agree that the electoral college should be abolished and the government should change the voting system so that the president is voted by popular vote. We need to abolish the electoral college because the presidents that are being elected are not being elected by the citizens, but instead the president is elected by the electors that are elected by the citizens. The electoral college process should go no further because it is unfair, outdated, and irrational. I really long to see a change in voting systems soon.",0
"There are many advantages to having broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject. One of the most important benefits is that it makes you more well-rounded and versatile. Specializing in one subject can limit your opportunities and make you less marketable in the job market. It can also make you more narrow-minded and inflexible.

Broad knowledge of many academic subjects also helps you to develop critical thinking skills. When you are exposed to different subjects, you learn to analyze and compare different viewpoints. This is important in the workplace, where you may need to make decisions based on a variety of factors. It is also helpful when you are confronted with a problem that you have never encountered before.

Another advantage of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that it makes you more interesting and engaging. When you can talk about a variety of topics, people are more likely to want to engage in conversation with you. It also makes you a more well-rounded person, and you may be more likely to find a spouse who shares your interests.

Overall, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Specializing can limit your opportunities and make you less marketable. It can also make you more narrow-minded and inflexible. Broad knowledge of many academic subjects helps you to develop critical thinking skills, makes you more interesting and engaging, and helps you to become a more well-rounded person.",1
"The consumption of fast food has become an increasingly popular habit among teenagers in recent years. While the ease and convenience may make it appear to be a viable option, there are numerous negative consequences that come along with frequent indulgence in this type of diet. For starters, studies have linked the consumption of fast food with various health issues such as obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Eating too much processed food can also lead to nutritional deficiencies due to its lack of essential vitamins and minerals. The overconsumption of sodium found in many fast-food dishes can contribute to water retention which increases your risk for hypertension. Additionally, consuming large amounts of unhealthy fats can raise cholesterol levels thus putting stress on your cardiovascular system. Furthermore, eating out at restaurants often leads to larger portion sizes than you would normally eat if you were cooking meals from home – regardless of the nutritional content being consumed. This contributes directly to weight gain since we tend not to realize just how much we’ve eaten until after it’s gone! A diet rich in fried foods or sugary snacks will also cause drastic spikes and drops in energy levels resulting from crashing sugar highs which then leave us feeling hollowed out afterwards without any real nourishment having been acquired besides empty calories . Though it may seem like a convenient way for busy teens on-the-go who don't have time (or access) to prepare healthy meals - frequenting fast food establishments should be approached with caution as these types of diets can quickly wreak havoc on both physical health as well as mental wellbeing if left unchecked over long periods of time. Ultimately by educating yourself about proper nutrition while planning ahead when possible is always going ot be more beneficial than relying solely upon pre-packaged items or drive-thru windows!",1
"We all know the importance of a good night's sleep. We understand that getting quality rest is essential for both physical and mental health, yet many people do not prioritize this vital aspect of self-care enough in their daily lives. Today's fast-paced world has made it easy to sacrifice sleep in favor of extra hours at work or leisure activities, but what we often don't realize is just how much damage can be caused by lack of adequate rest - especially when it becomes chronic. Sleep deprivation affects cognitive processes like decision making, concentration and memory formation, which can significantly reduce one's productivity during the day; but perhaps more importantly, a lack of quality slumber can also have negative psychological impacts such as mood swings and even depression over time. Physically speaking, constantly running on too little sleep increases stress levels which weakens immunity - making us more susceptible to viruses as well as chronic inflammatory diseases due to fatigue compromising our bodies' healing capabilities. It doesn't help that most Americans do not get nearly enough restful shut eye each night either: adults aged 18-64 should aim for 7+ hours per night whereas those aged 65+ need 8 hours minimum per 24 hour period according to The Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC). Given its impact on both your body and mind there are several steps you can take to improve your nightly routine in order to ensure that you're getting the right amount of deep slumber every evening: keep regular bedtimes/wake times throughout the week; create an environment conducive for relaxation with noise control (i.e., white noise machines) temperature regulation (cooler temperatures tend to promote better sleeping conditions); utilizing blackout curtains or eye masks if needed; avoiding blue light exposure two to three hours prior from desired going-to-bed time(laptops/phones etcetera); supplementing dietary needs with things like magnesium or melatonin if necessary; winding down before bed with something relaxing such as reading or stretching rather than",1
"Does the Electoral College Work?

Mr. Senator,

I believe that the Electoral College should stay in process because it consists of 538 electors and the majority (270) that are the electoral votes that are required to elect a president. Elector  groups are picked by the runner; the groups help raise votes for the runners to get more word out on what the runner has to offer for our country. Plus, they make sure the elector running, has good legitiment reasons for becomeing our countries representor. With the presidential election held every four years, the Electorial College can be still processing men, and women, who are wanting to represent our country. Furthermore, the state elector running for president, is assisted by our votes, because when you vote for your candidates, you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Once the presidential election is over, the staes governers start a Certificate of Ascertainment witch list all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.",0
"The importance of proper hydration cannot be underestimated. Whether you are a student, office worker or professional athlete – staying properly hydrated is essential for optimal health and performance. Not only does it help regulate body temperature, but it can also prevent kidney stones and other medical issues. Additionally, it helps to promote clear thinking and boosts energy levels throughout the day. Staying adequately hydrated isn't always easy; many people fail to drink enough fluids each day to meet their needs because they forget or don’t have access to water when out of the house. That's why carrying a reusable water bottle with you wherever you go can make all the difference! A refillable container encourages frequent consumption of liquids even if there aren’t public drinking fountains around – meaning no more lugging around heavy jugs all day long! You don't need an expensive stainless steel design either – plastic bottles are lightweight and inexpensive alternatives that won't break your budget while still helping keep your body on track with its daily H2O intake requirements. Some experts recommend aiming for 8-10 glasses per day (roughly 2 liters). However this may vary depending on individual factors like activity level or climate conditions so be sure to listen to your own body’s cues too! For instance, if you feel dizzy or sluggish during workouts then that could indicate dehydration which should never be ignored as serious consequences can result from lack of adequate fluid intake over time - especially in hot weather months where perspiration evaporates quickly leaving us vulnerable without replenishment!. Consuming plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables also helps do wonders for proper hydration since these contain high amounts of natural electrolytes like potassium which aid in rehydrating cells faster than plain tap water alone would do the job by itself. So make sure not just guzzle down lots without eating nutritious foods alongside them first as this will better ensure that those necessary sugars get absorbed into our bodies correctly instead being",1
"I think what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is true, because when all the people do their own self and become their own self. the chance for those people to become something else in this world is really high. They accomplishment to do greatest things in the world.

Many people in this world believe that becoming thier own self is better for them, because people would not have to deal with the negative minds that other people have, because by the way all the people have different minds and some people can have possitive minds but there is lot of people that have negative minds. People that decided they wanna become something else in this world with other people it would be really hard for them to become some else this world. The reason why it would be really hard for them is because they would have to deal with possive minds and negative minds. But the people that decided that they wanna because accomplish in be better in this world. Those people are the one's that decided to become their own, because they wont have to deal with no neggative minds they would just do what their head tells them to do without hearing negative minds and they just keep gone keep doing what they think would be the best for them.

People that decided that they wanna become their own, is for a reason they decided to do that becauuse they wanna become better people in the world, they wanna give their families a better life style, but the main thing is. They wanna be an example for their kids, they wanna show their kids that no matter what if they keep their head up and keep and possitive minds. They would be able to accomplish anything in life, but they would show their kids that become their own thins, it is not just become their own things, all that have work and dicipline, but the main thing is always keep their minds possitve. people that become their own after they make a family they would start showing thei kids to become their own since a young age. they would show their kids the work and decipline it takes to become their own self. When lot of people dont think the same way but each people have their minds set.

I think at this point in life and in the whole world. The people that should start thiking about if they wanna become their own is. All the people that is about to graduated High School. the people that is at the age of 17 and 18 years should be ones that start thinking about that. because all those people about to get until the real world and they gone see what real is, in the real world. people never know the obstacles that life can put on you as soon as you get in the real world. Life would might put you hella obstacles just for you to realize and see what you doing, so those kids that are about to graduated high school they need to do their best so they can go throught all the obstacles that life would put on them in the journey for them to make it all the way to the up to their dreams.

All this it comes to the people that they wanna become their self. They would have to keep mind possive and think it would not be easy at all, but doing hard work and always looking forward they would be able to do it. Everyone is this world can accomplish the greater things in this world and be better. All those people need is motivation and have their mind possitive to make it all the way up to their dreams. All hard work have pay off at the end, people would realize that all the hard work they did was something better life and when they look back at all the hard work they did. They would of their own self, they would be like all this n all the obstacles i had to go throught was for some better in my life and for a huge chance in me now i can said all the work i been done, it is finally acomplished.",0
"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit citizens and communities. According to passages 1 and 2, reducing the number of vehicles on the road can help improve air quality and public health. Both passages explain that vehicle emissions contain pollutants like nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds that contaminate the air we breathe. When inhaled over long periods of time, these pollutants have been linked to respiratory illnesses and other health problems. By driving less and using alternative modes of transportation more frequently, such as walking, cycling, or public transit, the air will become cleaner and citizens will face less health risks from air pollution.  

Another advantage of limiting car usage highlighted in passage 3 is that it can help reduce traffic congestion on roads. The passage discusses how a large volume of cars contributes to traffic jams during morning and evening commuting hours. When there are fewer vehicles competing for space on limited road networks, traffic will flow more smoothly. This means shorter travel times for drivers and less time wasted stuck in traffic. It can also cut down on congestion-related costs like wasted fuel and work hours lost sitting idle. Passage 1 also notes reduced congestion can have environmental benefits by decreasing vehicle emissions in traffic.

Finally, all three passages note that limiting car use supports more sustainable transportation options. Shifting modes away from private vehicles to biking, walking and public transit creates multi-modal transportation networks that are less dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels. This moves societies closer to more environmentally-friendly methods of travel outlined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It promotes community health by making active transit more widely used. By informing citizens of these advantages, more may choose to drive less and adopt sustainable alternatives, benefiting both personal well-being and the wider community.",1
"Exploring the Benefits of Learning a Second Language at an Early Age Being bilingual brings many advantages to young learners, and children who are exposed to two languages from an early age have been found to benefit greatly. From bolstering cognitive development and improving communication skills, to expanding cultural understanding and career prospects, learning a second language offers many tangible benefits that can last throughout life. First, studying another language correlates strongly with improved academic achievement in other disciplines such as mathematics or science. In fact, research has found that students who study foreign languages perform much better than those who do not on standardized tests in all subject areas. Furthermore, those students demonstrate greater critical thinking skills through their aptitude for problem-solving and analytical reasoning; they often outperform non-language learners even by the time they reach college. This is due in part because multiple languages provide extensive opportunities for creativity and mental exercise—allowing more space for flexible thought processes compared to single language speakers. In addition, acquiring a second language builds strong communication abilities which are vital both personally and professionally. Knowing more than one language widens access to different cultures around the world by providing enhanced opportunity for conversing with peers of various backgrounds while traveling abroad or engaging with people online via social media outlets like Skype or Facebook Messenger’s translator tool – this helps build deeper ties between communities globally. It also improves interpersonal relationships within local contexts; being able to communicate effectively across cultures means having better chances of making lasting connections within one's community too!. Not only does speaking multiple tongues open doors socially but it can also increase employability later on in life because companies increasingly value bilingual candidates when seeking workers (e.g., customer service). What’s more - depending on where you live - some schools may offer credits towards graduation if students pass exams demonstrating their fluency in additional languages thus opening up potential scholarship options as well!. All things considered then it becomes clear why so many parents these days are",1
"I would agree with keeping the Electoral College because its a fair way to elect the president of the united states. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final dessision.

Even though your voting for your candidate your really voting for the candidates electors. Most states have a winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

After the presidential election your govenor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of your candidates who ran for president in your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state at the meeting of the electors in December. Then the certificate is sent to the congress  and the national records of the presidential election.",0
"With the development of economy and growth of the population.

Yes, I agree that our society has become a throw away society. We have become so dependent on consumerism and materialism that it is no longer possible for us to live in a way that is sustainable. This is why we need to change the way we live and how we use our resources. I believe that the most effective way to do this is by reducing the amount of waste we produce and by recycling more and more of what we do use. The more we recycle, the less waste there will be and the more resources we will have to use in the future.

What is the environmental impact of these bottles and do they have any negative impact on our health? Are there any alternatives to these types of bottles available to us today?

"Distance learning classes allow students to receive education from the comfort of their own home. However, there are some arguments to consider when debating whether or not such classes are an appropriate substitute for traditional schooling. The most notable drawbacks of distance learning classes are issues with distractions, homework struggles, and financial hardship. 

First, there are a higher number of potential distractions for students attending distance learning classes from home. Common distractions can include siblings, pets, television, computers, and mobile phones. These distractions can be difficult to ignore, and may lead to a lack of time spent focused on their studies. These instances of distraction and procrastination can lead to a decrease in academic performance. 

Second, homework struggles can be more present in virtual classrooms compared to traditional classrooms. This is due to students being unable to ask their teacher for help in real-time. Without the more immediate help, assignments such as homework and projects may become more difficult for students to complete. As a result, they could fall behind other students and find it more difficult to keep up with their studies. 

Finally, distance learning classes could potentially increase financial difficulties for students. With students already facing tuition and book costs, the lack of assistance provided by distance learning classes may lead to less economic support. Financial aid and scholarships would be much less beneficial to distance learning students who don’t attend an in-person class, and student loan guidelines are often inflexible. This could lead to additional stress and further strain on a student’s budget. 

In conclusion, distance learning classes are not the ideal learning environment for students, considering factors such as distractions, homework struggles, and financial issues. As such, students should carefully consider all of the drawbacks associated with distance learning classes before making the decision to attend such classes from home.",1
"Dear principal ,As a student i think we should balance The school menu of healththeir school lunches is a good idea and also a bad idea, the resaon why is when most students don't take care of their own body by eating junk food but most student like their favorite food for example, most students in my class when they eat their favorite food for example pizza, in lunch it will affect their stomach but not only their stomach but they have nothing health besides milk to eat.

My second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow.

My thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no Fried Chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken. So in conclusion I think that we should balance them out like their should days were we eat health foods and days we can eat favortite foods.

When the food is Balance students will be able be more happy if they just have both their favorrite foods and something Health to eat, so in my opinon i really hope you make students have both their favorrite foods and healtheir foods so that all students would be happy and so as their body.",0
"Humans are naturally curious creatures. No matter what people try to do their curiousity will always get the better of them. This is not a bad thing, being curious has changed life on Earth durasically. New inventions have been made vaccines have been created to help people improve their quality of life. Not only has the human curiosity helped to improve life here on Earth, but it has also brought new knowledge about the things outside of Earth's atomosphere.

Since the 1800s devices had been made to expaned people's knowledge about the planets around Earth. Computers have been made that make calculations by using gears and levers. These machines had been made as early as the 1800s and played an important roles in human history. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick. With the modern advances in technology there are no reasons to why with even more improvements made humans would not be able to go an explore other planets such as Venus.

Changing perspective on going to Venus could help humans to one day actually go and study the magnificent planet of Venus. We should think of them (risks) as challenges. Instead of thinking of the opsticalls that will have to be faced when going to Venus, think of them as challenges that will have to be overcame to get the succes and the results needed.

There are other approaches that could be taken on traveling to Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Despite the dangers that lie ahead with traveling to Venus there are so much more advantages and knowledge that can be gained from going to Venus. By actually going on Venus NASA sciencetist would be able to study rock, gas, or anything else that is more than what could be done if they only got a 'birds eye view' of Venus.

Sciencetist could discover exactly why Venus is so inhospitable compared to Earth. They would be able to comferm their beliefs of Venus being covered largely with oceans. Sciencetist could find out what Venus would have been able to support. They would be able compare how exactly Earth and Venus are so simular and also how they are so different. The knowledge that they learn could even improve life here on Earth.

Humans are always going to want to discover new things outside of Earth's atomosphere, which has helped improve life for many people. With the modern advancements being made in technology and the knoewledge that could be optained by going to Venus there is no reason to why in the near future exploration of Venus should not be mastered. Every trip outside of Earth's atomosphere will have new challenges and new opsticalls to overcome. If NASA would not have worked hard like they did Neil Armstrong would never have gotten to the moon. Now is the time to overcome the challenges and get someone to Venus.",0
"The use of cars has always affected society greatly. There are plans constantly being added to better the environment without the use of cars. Vauban, mentioned in Source 1, can be the start of the carless world we want to live in. As this experiment becomes noticed by the world, communities will realize how beneficial this experiment could be. Think about a world with no cars. There would be less pollution and less gasses being emitted into the air. For example, Pairs has just banned driving due to heavy smog. After about five days, car traffic was down 60 percent. Limiting car usage should be implemented heavily because of the greenhouse gas emissions and the happiness of the citizens of Vauban.

To begin with, cars cause many problems and the most important being the emissions of greenhouse gasses. As seen in Source 1, some of the car fillled cities of the United States suffer from up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Wellpopulated cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago could be in great danger. A highly populated city in Colombia, has a CarFree day. The goal of this is to allow people to open their eyes and realized how many alternative ways there are to go to work. The implemented a fee of 25 dollars to anyone who violated. I think that by adding a fee, the outcome would be greater and more people would participate. This is a great idea that would open people up to other options. For example, on the third year of the car free day, two other cities joined Bogota. Sometimes we have to open up the eyes of others to really see the change. Also, parks and recreational areas have opened up, uneven sidewalks have been refurbished, and most importantly the city has less traffic.

Continuing with pollution, Paris had a nearrecord of pollution, seen in Source 2. This led to the ban of driving. The ban of driving could be refered to as the limiting of driving. They set up a plan in which cars with evennumbered license plates couldn't drive on Mondays. The same occurred for the oddnumbered license plates on Tuesday. They heavily enforced this by implementing a fine of 22 euros if they used their cars. This idea could work here in America. It would open up carpooling and lessen the amount of cars on the road.

People such as David Goldberg, mentioned in Source 1, are pushing for cities to be less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg mentions the hybrid car. Even though buying a hybrid does not reduce the amount of cars, it does reduce the amount of green house gas emissions.

Seeing the happiness and comfort that the people of Vauban allows us to see what our society could look like. We could live in a society just like theirs, filled with nature. In the United States, the number of licenses has been going down each year. Now, this does not automatically mean that American citizens want to be green. It could be simply because of the fact that cars are expensive, and because we are living in a rough situation. In conclusion, I believe that we should limit car usage for the advantages of less pollution and less greenhouse gasses.",0
"In this passage/story it talks about how we should challenge ourselves to explore Venus and how Venus is sometimes called the Evening Star. Venus is planet and when your laying down on your grass outside in the night when you wanna watch the sunrise go down you can see it because it is the brightest points of light in the night sky we can spot venus esaily in the sky when its dark. Venus is the closes to Earth in the terms of density and size. There are other planets too not just Venus there is a planet called Mars, Jupiter and Earth there was a planet called pluto its not a planet anymore because scientist thought it was so small and scientist didn't reall care about that planet. Some of our planets are called sister planets sister plants i think sister planets are planets that look the same scientist at his point don't know what are they or waht other name should they called them. When you see a word like this (NASA) what comes to your mind when you see a word like that NASA is the abberviation for The National Aeronautics and Space Administration you might wonder what is that this is something for scientists instead of saying the whole thing they just say (NASA) it's a easier way for scientists to communicate with each other. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus but the challenging part is the clouds when it rains and in the night you can't see venus because of the cloudsand how the clouds are too fat that they cover up Venus. Scientists are still woking on studying Venus well the (NASA) is because they are still trying to figure out why is Venus known as the small planet and the brightest one in the Earth ass well. Venus makes it chllenging for the scientists because they have been studying this planet for so long but they can't figure out nothing just yet. In the 1800s there was an old technology called the mechanical computers these computers had a important role in the 1940s during World Warr II these devices made calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at this time we use computers that are flexible and way faster in this time now but back then the computers were way slower. So in my opinion we should all have a challenge to study and explore Venus.",0
"Graduating high school in three years can provide many opportunities for young students that wouldn't be available in a traditional four year high school program. Graduating at an early age gives students the unique opportunity to explore higher education and the workforce, while also providing valuable time to build real-world experience. 

One great example of a successful person who achieved early graduation is Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and CEO of Facebook. At just the age of 19, Zuckerberg graduated from Harvard University after attending high school for only three years. Although Zuckerberg made a habit of jumping ahead of his peers, he states that he only considered graduating early after he took Advanced Placement courses during his high school years. 

High school graduates also have the option of pursuing special opportunities that open up to them earlier if they don't take the traditional four year route. For instance, many universities offer early admission and scholarships programs to students who choose to apply early. Furthermore, some high schools may even offer special degree programs that allow students to graduate early while earning college credit or a technical certificate. 

Finally, one of the most notable advantages for young students who choose to graduate high school in three years is the benefit of taking a gap year. A gap year offers students the chance to take time away from their studies to spend a year in specialized activities, such as volunteering, travel, research, and education. During this gap year, students have the unique opportunity to gain valuable skills, network, and explore new interests, all of which can provide advantages later in life.

In conclusion, graduating high school in three years can provide a variety of benefits and opportunities for young students that may not be available in the traditional four year route. Students that choose to pursue this route can look forward to taking advantage of special programs and resources, furthering their education early, and taking a gap year to explore new interests.",1

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons from Around the World 

Indeed, the necessity and benefits of curbing car usage have been clearly emphasized in a range of international contexts. By examining case studies set in Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the United States, we can glean a holistic understanding of how minimizing car usage can significantly enhance our society, both on the environmental and human levels.

To begin with, Vauban, a car-free district in Germany, illustrates a successful example of de-emphasizing car-ownership to promote community cohesion, personal health, and environmental consciousness (Rosenthal, Passage 1). A striking 70 percent of families do not own cars and the scarcity of noise pollution fosters a serene atmosphere conducive to interaction and outdoor activities. This aligns with advancing trends around the globe known as smart planning, an endeavor to divorce suburban lifestyles from cars, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering community resilience (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

Likewise, strict vehicular restrictions in Paris following periods of intense pollution further illustrates the necessity of such measures. The driving ban not only led to a 60 percent decrease in congestion, but it also temporarily ameliorated air quality by reducing pollutants trapped in the atmosphere (Duffer, Passage 2). 

The concept of car-reduced communities is also palpable in Bogota, Colombia, where car-free days are celebrated annually. This initiative not only reduces air pollution but simultaneously promotes alternate transportation modes, such as biking and public transit (Selsky, Passage 3). 

In the United States, changes in behavior patterns and decreasing car ownership and usage demonstrate a shift in cultural values and priorities. The rise in telecommuting, urban renewal, and commuting alternatives such as bike-sharing programs and car-pooling apps all contribute to a progressively car-independent lifestyle (Rosenthal, Passage 4). This movement not only significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also resets cultural perspectives on travel, mobility, and community planning.

Although drastic changes in car-dependent societies can seem daunting, these examples demonstrate the countless benefits that emerge when we rethink how we move and interact within our communities. Recognizing cars as a means rather than an end in and of itself is the first step towards a more sustainable, efficient, and connected society. Reducing car usage not only lessens environmental impacts but also fosters social cohesion, personal health, and novelty in our daily experiences. As this trend continues, we must pave our path forward with deference to these fundamental improvements, knowing well that the road to a sustainable future is seldom driven, but often walked upon.",1
"Most people would think of an electoral collage as a place rather than a system. The Electoral collage was a process that was create to help make voting easier when in fact it complicated things. I agree with with source 2 paragraph 14. paragraph 14 clear states It's official: The electoral collage is unfair, outdated, and irrational. i am completely convinced that the electoral collage is no longer necessary. There is a lot wrong with it, such as having to trust people to be honest and vote the right way, or simply just discrediting a state because of it population.

With the electoral collage, you are to have state representatives. Your state is to take a majority vote and relay that information to the state representatives. Then the state representatives will then vote according to how the majority persuaded them to vote. However many things can go wrong with this they can simply vote their way or like paragraph 10 states, they can get confused and vote for the wrong candidate.

Due to the fact states have electoral votes based on size and population that one vote could cost the election. on the other hand, the electoral vote are very unfair. i believe everybody should have their own individual say so in elections.

Some of you may believe that this saves time, but in reality everybody has to vote anyway. in fact it takes more time by deciding state representatives and so on and so forth. i really couldn't think of any other reasons you would want such a corrupt system like thus one. this system is obscured.

I guess its all in what you believe. i personally believe this system is outdated. i doubt this system even worked well in the old days. Now-a-days there is some crazy people in this world. it is hard to trust anybody, even family. Also America always preaches against discrimination however they still portray it. the have discrimination against some states because they lack people. however some states choose to lack people so the don't have to become an industrial state. they may want to maintain that farm state feeling. farmers tend to take up a lot of land pushing people away. frankly we still need farmers. just like we need a new system.",0
"Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to you today as a concerned citizen and dedicated constituent in our great state of [Your State]. Specifically, I am deeply worried about the mechanism by which we elect the most influential political leader in the nation - the President of the United States. Over time, the Electoral College method stipulated by the founding fathers has been a contentious topic for democratic life, stirring debates about its efficiency and fairness to our citizens.

According to What Is the Electoral College?, it was established as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of the Federal Register). The concept behind the Electoral College was to furnish a buffer against the impulse decisions of the masses, while ensuring a fair distribution of representational rights among states with varying populations.

Andy yet, Bradford Plumer in The Indefensible Electoral College raises cogent arguments about the disadvantages of the Electoral College. The disaster factor is significant, with the potential of electors defying the will of the people and instances of “faithless” electors swaying the vote (Plumer). Moreover, due to the winner-take-all system, swing states receive disproportionate attention from presidential candidates, ultimately diminishing the influence of non-swing states in the outcome of the election.

Despite these drawbacks, Judge Richard Posner in his piece In Defense of the Electoral College successfully argues that the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome, encourages a president with nationwide appeal, and avoids complicated runoff elections. This method ensures that the elected president does not solely represent a single region or populous state, but carries the mandate of a broad and diverse nation (Posner).

However, our democracy has evolved since the founding fathers' era, the influence of states has been balanced by other mechanisms, and the popular vote guarantees a more equitable representation of the citizens' will. A change to the popular vote system would ensure that every vote by every citizen in every state matters equally and directly contributes to the result. This principle aligns more closely with the tenets of a modern democratic society.

I understand that the transition from the Electoral College to a popular vote system would be a significant task that requires constitutional amendments, but it is a challenge that we must undertake to uphold our democratic values and ensure that the voice of every American citizen is heard.

I sincerely hope, Senator [Last Name], that you consider my plea for this critical change in our electoral system. Let's contribute to a future where every vote carries the same weight, no matter which state it comes from. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1
"Many students face the challenge of deciding whether to work on their studies alone or in groups. While working in groups certainly has its advantages, such as enabling collaboration, working alone has the potential to be incredibly beneficial as well. This essay will discuss the advantages of students working alone, such as improved time management, better focus, and self-challenging. 

In terms of time management, working alone is a great way to stay on task and use one's time wisely. When working in groups, there is always the potential for one's time to be wasted due to slim productivity from other group members or sidetracking conversations. When working alone, however, students can set their own pace and dedicate their time to their own tasks accordingly without interruption.

With respect to focus, working alone can also help ensure that students are best able to use their attention on their own studies, rather than be distracted by others in the group. Working alone enables students to stay in their own zone and keep distractions and extraneous conversations to a minimum. 

Lastly, working alone presents the opportunity for self-challenging. It can be difficult to hold oneself accountable to do more than what is asked of them, but working alone provides the motivation to go above and beyond. With no one around to rely on, taking the initiative to add to the project is crucial.

In conclusion, working alone has many advantages for students. It allows for improved time management, better focus, and self-challenging. All of these elements are key for students to become successful and should be taken into serious consideration.",1

"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit our communities and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and air pollution. Countries like Germany, France, and Colombia have implemented various strategies to limit car usage and have experienced positive outcomes. These initiatives range from car-free neighborhoods to car-free days, all aimed at promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating more sustainable communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or using public transportation, we can significantly reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage is the alleviation of traffic congestion. In cities like Paris, where driving bans were enforced during periods of intense smog, there was a significant decrease in congestion. In fact, congestion in the capital of France was reduced by 60 percent during the driving ban. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces the time and frustration associated with commuting. With fewer cars on the road, people can travel more efficiently and safely.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on air quality. The use of diesel fuel, which is common in many countries, including France, has been linked to increased air pollution. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and reducing diesel usage, we can improve air quality and protect public health. In Bogota, Colombia, car-free days have been implemented to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. The success of this initiative has led to other Colombian cities joining in, indicating the potential for these events to inspire change in other countries as well.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. In Germany, the suburb of Vauban serves as a model for low-car suburban life. With car-free streets, residents have to rely on walking, cycling, or using public transportation to get around. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars to move to this car-free community. This approach to urban planning allows for more compact communities, with amenities and services within walking distance, reducing the need for long car trips.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving air quality, and creating sustainable communities, we can create a better future for ourselves and future generations. Countries like Germany, France, and Colombia have already implemented strategies to limit car usage, and these initiatives serve as examples for other countries to follow. It is essential that we continue to explore and support measures that promote alternative modes of transportation and reduce our reliance on cars.",1
"Venus is sometimes called the Evening Star when it is no star at all. Venus is a planet right next to Earth. The author provides examples of the advantages of exploring Venus such as getting a better understanding of Venus, its the closest planet to Earth, and its the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The author believes a worthy pursuit is to study Venus despite the dangers it poses.

First of all, exploring Venus would give us a better understanding of this planet and why it is important we study it. On the planet surface of Venus the tempertures average over 800 degrees, and because of the dense atmosphere most forms of light cannot be penetrated. In the article it states, If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astromomers are fascinated by Venus becuase it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. With the author adding this in his article it proves that studying Venus could benefit the human race in the long run.

Second of all, Venus is the closest planet to Earth. This gives Earth advantages of being able to send out a spacecraft to land on Venus. The article says, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too, Eath, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world. With this in the article it shows that being able to send out spacecraft to Venus expands the curiosity and imagination of scientists wanting to explore Venus.

Finally, Venus is the most Earth- like planet in the solar system. In the artice it describes, Long ago, Venus was provably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Eath. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. This proves that Venus could of been just like Earth today.

In conclusion, the authors suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despute the dangers it presents. The author gives us evidence of why its important such as, we would expand our understanding of Venus, it is the closest planet to Earth, and its the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. There is no garantee that the study of Venus will continue, but there are many reasons why it should.",0
"In Vauban, Germany, citizens have made the decision to not use cars. To some people, this may be something that they could never imagine themselves doing, because it would make life more complicated. However, these people are pleased with their decision and would not have it any other way. Furthermore, there are many advantages to making this change. By limiting car usage, citizens can improve their own health and economic state.

By making the decision to stop using cars, one can become healthier, both mentally and physically. One citizen who has already taken this step said,when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way Rosenthal 3. Many people who chose to limit their car usage, decided to walk or ride bikes instead. By chosing the alternative, they are less stressed. There is something soothing about walking down the road in a quiet and peaceful environment. Walking gives one time to reflect and think, while driving requires concentration and can be stressful. In addition to improving one's mental health, limiting car usage can also improve one's physical health. Pollution from the air can take a toll on someone's physical health and the environment around them. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States Rosenthal 5. Pollution poisons the air of most cities where people live and breathing the pollution is not healthy for an individual. In cities like Beijing, inhabitants wear air filters over their mouths in hopes fo escaping the pollution. Limiting car usage can help improve air quality quickly. For example, after having multiple days of intense smog, Paris decided to ban cars with evennumbered plates for one day. After this one day of limited car usage, the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday Duffer 19.

Another advantage to limiting cars is that it could mean economic improvement for individuals and countries. The banning of cars can mean improvement in the appearance of cities, which can have positive impacts on the economy of cities. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have beeen replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks Selsky 28. These improvements in the city can draw more people to them and stimulate the economy in places that have had difficulty before. In addition, individuals can save money by carpooling, biking, walking, or using public transit as an alternative optopn to driving. During the 2013 rececession, people were forced to sell their cars due to lack of money. However, after they recovered from this, they decided not to return to car usage due to their content in the lifestyle they had chosen Rosenthal 32 In conclusion, limiting one's usage of cars can have only positive impacts on one's life. This decision can have lasting impacts one's happiness, the environment, and the economy.",0
"The Electoral College should be abolished. It is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It just makes so much more sense to go with the popular vote from everyone. Even Bob Dole agreed to this and said Abolish the Electoral College! Most people just despise it anyways, let's just get rid of it already.

Let's face it, if you have a vote, it would go to the slate of electors who in turn, vote for the president. The worst thing about it is that sometimes they can't even control their own vote. What use is that? It doesn't make sense if they can't even control something that they have such as a vote. Also some voters get confused and don't know what to vote for though. Instead, they can vote for the wrong candidate. This is why we should get rid of the Electoral College. It's just so unfair to other voters that they can't have their way because the others get confused. This can let to political disasters and events that will make people riot over a mistake that they made. They need to learn that the Electoral College needs to go.

First off, the founding fathers established the Electoral College in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It was was founded all the way back then, it must surely be outdated and we should really try to go by our modern intelligent ways now. They believed the winner takes all system that just doesn't make sense anymore if you can just vote on your own and when the President wins, it will just be the popular vote from overall everyone.

Secondly, the people in Congress are well educated indeed, but do we really need their separate votes? Can we just skip that? We are already getting the popular vote of qualified citizens which is good. All these electors are just so unnecessary when it comes down to it. I understand only a few people still want the electoral College in place, but in all honesty, it is only what they have been taught and they think it is the right thing. There are 538 electors in the Electoral College and they need a majority of 270 electoral votes. This seems far too complicated just for voting on a President. All we need is the popular vote. There has even been a case in the 2000's that is called Disaster Factor. Americans are even lucky that this event isn't the most that can potentially happen with the Electoral College in place. We should avoid this political disaster at all costs!

In the end, we should all finally understand that the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational. It was made long, long ago and we have a better way to vote other than dealing with the mess of electors getting confused and the people in Congress dealing with it all together. Just go by the popular vote from the people and we would be good to go.",0
"Dear State Senator,

Perhaps you may know about the 'electoral college'. In my point of view, I would keep the electoral college because it's better and the process has been the same in decades. So why change it?

The Electoral College is better because it's more fair. In the story, What Is the Electoral College?, it tells how the voting for president and vice president works. one for each memeber in the house of representatives plus for your senators Meaning the state votings plus the the number of members in the Congressional delegation. Also in the the story, What Is the Electoral College?, it states  Each candidate running for President in your state his or her own group electors...... but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

In other words, canadiates that are running for President have their own people to elect them but the state laws say that candidates are suppose to be elected by their responsibilities. Even though other say  the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational I think it is fair for how they process the Electoral College because it let's the candidate that you or that your state is voting have the opportunity to make some changes in the world.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME.",0
"dear senator,

I have come to a conclusion on how I think the president and his candidates should be voted for. In one hand we've got the Electoral College, and the election by popular vote. These two thing have been around for hundreds of years but you've got to know if you prefer one or the other. So which one works better? Why do you prefer this one over the other?

The Electoral College, electors meeting and voting for our president and vice president. This electoral college consist of 538 electors that vote to for our president. I myself dont think this is a very sensable thing. Because when you think you're voting for the president you are actually voting for a state of electors who will in turn vote for the president not you. Why should there be a select few people out of the billions of people who live in america to vote for the president while we just sit and wait for the results. To only have their opinions voiced. Does'nt seem like a very fair way to elect someone who will be changing our country. This is a winner-take-all-system.

Election by popular vote, this means you and I will be voting for the president and his cabinet ourselves. That we will have a say in who we want to change or even fix our country. Although the person we vote for may not win, we still got a say in what we believe would have made our counrty a better place. Although the Electoral College might give a more clear winner, if we know that our vote will actually have an effect in the election we might pay more attention to the election and vote more wisely. Knowing that we have voiced our preference rather than knowing maybe one single electoral vote might have set the election.

Now there are some benefits if the Electoral College. In the case of having a precise vote on who gets to be president is one. Also maybe the fact that you voted fo the people who will be electing the president in a way is just the same. However this does notmean that it is better than you just voting yourself. Because those are onlyabout the two thing that are evn remotely good about the Electoral College.

So when you decide who you want to be president think of how you would like your vote to be heard. through your own vote or maybe/possibly through anothers vote. I know which system i would choose. Giving that it would give me more voicein the matter. What would you do?",0
"The teenage years are often seen as a time of exploration and testing limits. It is during this time that youths can explore their passions and interests, without consequence. However, failure is an inevitable consequence of life. Despite the fear of failure that hinders many teens, failure itself has its pros and cons. 

On the positive side, failure can make someone a better person. Failing as a teen gives an individual the opportunity to identify their weaknesses and grow from it. It forces teens to assess themselves, build self-awareness, and consider how to improve their skills or approach. As uncomfortable as a lesson in failure may be, it can create emotional maturity and humility. This self-reflection and insight can be invaluable in later life.

On the other hand, failure as a teen can have profound ramifications. Many teens take failure personally, letting it shape their self-confidence and their views of the world and their future. It can also lead to a feeling of being “stuck” or “broken” and thus unable to move forward. In some cases, a teen that experiences failure could find their hopes and aspirations dashed. 

At the end of the day, failure as a teen is unavoidable. How one chooses to tackle the situation and learn from it will have powerful implications for the future. It is important to remember that everyone has at least one failure in their life and the key is to know how to use this to one’s advantage. With the right mindset and guidance, failure can be a fantastic teacher and provide opportunities to become a better person.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of these advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased access to alternative transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the impact it has on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. This is particularly important as efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions become more urgent on a global scale.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog illustrates the detrimental effects of car emissions on the environment. The ban resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and smog levels. By limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, cities can not only improve air quality but also create healthier and more sustainable environments for their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the increased accessibility to alternative transportation options. The passage about Vauban, Germany, showcases a community that has embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this community, residents have access to a tram system and convenient walking and biking infrastructure. By designing communities in a way that prioritizes public transportation and pedestrian-friendly spaces, it becomes easier for residents to rely less on cars and utilize other forms of transportation. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a more active and healthier lifestyle.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights the success of a car-free day initiative in reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can save on infrastructure costs associated with building and maintaining roads and parking facilities. Additionally, car-free initiatives can boost local economies by promoting the use of public transit, walking, and biking, which in turn supports local businesses and reduces the reliance on car-centric industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, increase access to alternative transportation options, and have economic benefits. As the passages demonstrate, this approach is being embraced in various parts of the world and can contribute to creating healthier, more sustainable, and livable communities. By prioritizing alternative transportation and designing communities with less emphasis on car dependency, individuals and society can reap the benefits of limiting car usage.",1
"In  The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is interesting, helpful, and it is safe. The passage tells about how the planet Venus can improve and is useful. Venus could be dangerous, but there are many more reasons that Venus is a good oppurtunity to research on. There are many new discoveries not yet found.

There are many interesting things about Venus. First of all, Venus is the second planet from our sun. In paragraph 2, it states, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Second of all, Venus atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The conditions are far more extreme than what human encountered. Third of all, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. There might be additional volcanoes and powerful earthquakes. Last of all, Venus is called the  Evening Star.

Venus is a helpful planet because of its characteritics. First of all, often Venus is refered to as Earths twin. By stating that its saying that the planet Venus is just like the planet Earth. Second of all, If Venus is the same as Earth, then it would be possibe for people to visit and see the place. In paragraph 3 It states that, A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Third of all, it has higher carbon dioxide, so it is helpful for us. Last of all, Venus might be useful to us someday in the future.

The planet Venus is a safe place because of all the facts that is stated in the passage. First of all, If Earth is a safe place for us, then Venus would be too. Even the astronomers are fascinated of how much both the planets are alike. Second of all, Venus could someday be our second home or a place where we can visit. In the passage it states, Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. Third of all, Venus is safe because the NASA has been doing experiments and testing on stuffs. NASA has been experimenting it on with inventions. Last of all, scientists even seek to conduct a thorough mission about Venus. By doing that scientists can understand more aboout the planet.

In conclusion, Venus is interesting, helpful, amd safe. Venus has been tested out and has been experimented on. By the experiments people can tell whether its safe or not. After finishing the passage, Venus is an environment which everyone would enjoy.",0
"Having this type of technology can help people understand others emotions in many ways. It is obvious that this type of technology can not only help others understand students emotions, but possibly help the students who are feeling a certain way. I think that using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable.

Having technology that can help show how a person is truly feeling is hepful in so many ways. For example, helping a person out who is feeling sad. A student in the classom is normally good at hiding their true emotions or how they are really feeling, but with this technology, a teacher could possibly help this student out once finding out that the student was upset or bothered with something either inside or outside of the classroom. Another way this technology is valuable is by being able to notice when a student is flustered or angry about not understanding a certain part of what they are learning. Not only can this technology determine one emotion, but can determain mixed emotions. This could help a lot when a student in the classroom may not fully understand a topic they are learning but say they understand it completly.

Having the chance to use this technology can help students further understand the subject they are on, because the teacher for sure recognizes that the student may not understand it. This also means teachers have more of the oppertunity to help their students out mentally. The use of this technology in classroms is very valubale for many obvious reasons.",0

"In the United States, democracy is advertised as a method of achieving selections, though this is unfortunately not the case. In the United States, we, as individuals, are not permitted to a fair or equal opportunity of voting systems. Vote should be popular, the will of the people of the nation, though through the Electoral College, the people is denied.

Voting is, as far as common sense goes, the majority rule. The Electoral College voting system was established during the creation of the Constitution in order to secure a qualified vote an effort to diminish the will of the lesser, or unknowing. Arguably, it is stated that, ..the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election, or in other words the statement can easily be translated to we do not wish a nation of idiotic voters to decide our president, each individual of the nation is mindful of others and care enough to express their opinion, as it is known a is a citizens duty to vote. A duty that must be followed. In any effort to simplify this, a voter is a voter. They are all qualified. If a person cares enough about their nation to cast a ballot, without requirement, they certainly are qualified.

Now that the qualifications are established, the electors within the Electoral College are free to do as they wish. Waving a magic wand, the support of others is unimportant now, and they pull whatever they desire out of the hat, as written by Bradford Plumer, Consider that state legislatures are technically responsiblefor picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. What happened to majority rule? People should have the direct vote of presidential candidate, however we are faced with shocking facts such as the house selection rarely displaying the correct majority rule, The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

The despicable system was established long ago for an extremely specific purpose with specific issues, which is no longer the case today. In the United States, we are not a democracy. We are a Republic. ridiculously, voters do not control the election in our Republic, as shared,...over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election. Can those expect change? Ironically, no. The system would most like not allow that, and those mindful citizens would need to hope for a glance at serendipity.",0

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a shift towards a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College offers several crucial benefits that should not be overlooked.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. With 538 electors in total, a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. This system has proven to produce a clear winner in the vast majority of presidential elections, preventing the need for run-off elections that would only further complicate the already lengthy and complex electoral process. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could lead to disputes over the outcome, as seen in the 2000 election, where the popular vote winner lost the presidency. The Electoral College provides a more stable and predictable process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of everyone's president. No single region of the country holds enough electoral votes to elect a president alone. Therefore, candidates are encouraged to campaign across different states and appeal to a wider range of voters. This ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation, rather than just the preferences of a single demographic or region. With a direct popular vote, there is a risk that candidates would primarily focus on densely populated areas and neglect the interests and concerns of smaller, less populated states.

Moreover, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states and engage with voters in these crucial battlegrounds. Voters in swing states are more likely to be highly informed and thoughtful, as their votes have the potential to tip the electoral scales. By focusing on these states, candidates are forced to address the concerns and aspirations of a diverse range of voters, ensuring that their policies and platforms cater to a wider array of citizens.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it balances the political weight of large and small states. While the population of a state impacts the number of electoral votes it receives, large states like California still have a greater influence, proportionally, than their population alone would suggest. This is due to the winner-take-all system, which grants a greater number of electoral votes to candidates who win a state, regardless of the margin of victory. This fairness in representation prevents smaller states from feeling marginalized and ensures that candidates address the needs of voters in both densely and sparsely populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College serves to avoid the complications that arise from elections where no candidate receives a majority of the votes. Run-off elections would be time-consuming and costly, potentially leading to further political division and uncertainty. The Electoral College method consistently produces a clear winner, thus avoiding the need for additional voting rounds and helping to maintain stability in the election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers several essential benefits and should not be discarded or replaced outright. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to campaign across diverse states, gives value to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While no system is perfect, retaining the Electoral College is crucial for preserving a fair and representative election process in the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective. I trust that you will weigh the advantages of the Electoral College and make a decision that best serves the interests of our great state and the nation as a whole. I appreciate your dedication to public service and wish you the best in your endeavors.

Sincerely,

"When were voting for president were not technically voting for the presient in fact we are voting for the slate of electors. The electors can be anyone without a public holding office. Electoral college process is not a good processs for presidency. While a president can get the majority of the popular vote; on the other hand, he could have the minority of the electoral college votes. That president would lose the elecetion even though he technicallly had the most votes. We should change the process into popular votes for the president.

The electoral college can or will defy the will of the people. The article The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted ,Back in 1960,segregationists in the Louisana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jhon F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy).The election whould have gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college are way too risky to take on. just simply couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election.

The electoral college is a unfair process becausse of the winner-take-all system. In the article called What Is The Electoral College, by the office of the Federeal register it quoted most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article  The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral  college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.

In conclusion,The electoral college is a unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular vote. Obviously popular votes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winner-takes it all process counterfits the number of american citizens voting result. Eletoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits. Electoral  college should be change and alter in to a different process with clean votes that'll actually be fair for once.",0
"The question of whether the greatness of individuals can be decided by their contemporaries or only by those who live after them is an interesting topic of debate. On the one hand, some argue that since the impact of an individual’s actions may not be seen until long after their death, their contemporaries may not have the necessary perspective to assess their greatness. On the other hand, others claim that since individuals often have a great impact on the world during their lifetime, their contemporaries can make a valid assessment of their greatness. In my opinion, I believe the greatness of individuals can be decided by both their contemporaries and those who live after them.

To begin with, it is certainly true that an individual’s greatness may be more clearly seen in hindsight. History is full of examples of individuals who were not fully appreciated or understood in their own time, yet were later recognized for the great contributions they made. For instance, the famous scientist Albert Einstein was often criticized by his contemporaries for his revolutionary theories of relativity. He was even labeled a “crackpot” by some scientists who disagreed with his work. However, his theories were eventually proven to be true and he is now remembered as one of the greatest scientists of all time. This example clearly shows that it is sometimes not until much later that an individual’s greatness can be truly appreciated.

On the other hand, it is also true that individuals can have an immediate and significant impact on the world and thus may be recognized as great by their contemporaries. Consider the example of Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of India’s struggle for independence from British rule. His peaceful protests and insistence on non-violence were seen as revolutionary at the time and inspired many others to join him in his struggle. As a result, he was widely admired and respected by his contemporaries as a great leader and is still remembered to this day as one of the most influential figures in modern history.

In conclusion, I believe that the greatness of individuals can be assessed by both their contemporaries and those who live after them. While it is true that some individuals may not be fully appreciated in their own time, others may have an immediate and lasting impact on the world and thus be seen as great by their contemporaries. Ultimately, only time will tell who will be remembered as great, and it is likely that both viewpoints will be taken into account in the final assessment.",1
"The author presents a strong argument suggesting a worthy pursuit to study Venus depsite dangerous endeavors, however, his statments regauarding un-reliability on current technology, the necessary actions to conduct research, and numerous failed attempts to reach Venus greatly outweigh the good outcomes of this mission. Venus is considered the planet that is most similar to Earth. The passage explained that scientist speculate if there was once life on Venus considering it incredible geographical and size similarities to earth. Although further research could test their theories, Venus has very extreme weather conditions harmul to man and other objects. A closer look and gathering of evidence is expected to make this mission a success. However, modern day technology is barely able to keep up efficiently by just the use of humans. These issues are far too risky to consider pursuing.

Venus has features such as mountains, craters, and even valleys that are also seen on Earth. According to the article, its atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide with temperatures averging 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth with can crush nearly anything that tries to reach its surface and even liquefy metals. The second paragraph discussed how spacecrafts in the past barely lasted a few hours and since there hasn't been a spacecraft sent there in more than three decades. This evidence shows that despite the success of reaching Venus, we are not even close to even slowly progressing and fixing smaller issues with spacecrafts traveling there and back to Earth. By not providing evidence of some sort of pregression or steps closer to considering sending humans to Venus, the author weakens his arguments over the better outcomes of conducting research.

Conducting research requires numerous forms of evidence, samples, test, etc. In paragraph 5, the author makes suggestions of creating a spacecraft to sustain temperatures of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit and levitating thirty-plus miles over the surface to observe the planet. Although this may be the most safest and efficient approach, he even stated that it would require getting up close and personal to collect samples. The whole idea is to reach Venus and collect data to compare to Earth and Venus' previous history. Without being able to collect samples, the author weakens his argument to study Venus despite the dangers it presents.

Lastly, modern day technology is known for its speed and cinvenience to access information. In paragraph 7, the author discussed how electronics we simplified to last at least three weeks in simulating conditions to Venus. He explained, modern computers...tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physicakl conditions. He supported this claim by informing readers that older technology, mechanical computers, have been re-evaluated and seem to have better calculations but involve levers and such. This weakens his argument because it would mean that this mission wouldn'tt be helpful if the right technology can't be utilized to help calculate and evalutate information.

All in all, the author makes very good claims as to why NASA should continue to pursue further research on Venus. It would help determine if there was previous life, if it once operated as successful as earth, and if Earth could potentially be headed in the same direction. However, the extreme weather conditions, actions necessary for research, and un-cooperative technology make this pursuit seem far less worth it considering how danger it is for humans and even the spacecrafts sent to examine the planet. Ultimately, the project can be deemed as impossible if facts given in the article remain the same.",0
"The debate over whether young people today do enough to help their communities has been contentious in recent years. Some argue that today's youth are disengaged and lack the sense of civic duty that previous generations had. However, I believe that this claim is unfair and inaccurate. Young people today are more engaged than ever before, and they are making significant contributions to their communities in a variety of ways.

One reason why young people are often criticized for not doing enough to help their communities is that they are more focused on their own lives than previous generations were. This is partly due to the increased pressure that young people face today to succeed academically and professionally. Many young people feel that they need to focus on their studies or their careers in order to secure a stable future for themselves. However, this does not mean that they are not interested in helping others. In fact, many young people today are passionate about social justice and are actively involved in organizations that promote causes such as environmental sustainability, LGBTQ+ rights, and racial justice.

Another reason why young people are often criticized for not doing enough to help their communities is that their methods of engagement are different from those of previous generations. In the past, volunteering and community service were often seen as the primary ways to contribute to one's community. While these activities are still important, young people today are more likely to use social media, online platforms, and other digital tools to engage with issues and create change. For example, many young people today are using social media to raise awareness about issues such as climate change, gun violence, and police brutality. They are also using online platforms to start grassroots campaigns and mobilize others to take action.

Finally, it is important to note that young people today face unique challenges that can make it difficult for them to engage with their communities. Many young people struggle with mental health issues, financial instability, and other personal challenges that can make it hard for them to focus on anything beyond their own needs. Furthermore, young people today are more diverse than previous generations, and they often come from communities that have been historically marginalized and underserved. In order to effectively engage with these communities, young people need to be given the tools and resources they need to succeed.

In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the claim that young people today do not give enough time to helping their communities. While it is true that young people today face unique challenges and use different methods of engagement than previous generations, they are nonetheless passionate and committed to making a positive difference in the world. Rather than criticizing young people for their perceived lack of engagement, we should be finding ways to support and empower them to create the change they want to see in their communities and in the world.",1
"There is no doubt that successful people often take risks and explore new opportunities. This is evident from the many success stories of entrepreneurs and businesspeople who have been willing to try new and innovative approaches to their respective industries. However, while there is certainly a place for risk-taking and experimentation in the pursuit of success, it is also important to recognize that success requires a balance of both risk-taking and a focus on developing existing skills.

When it comes to risk-taking, it is important to recognize that not all risks are worth taking. Successful people recognize that it is sometimes necessary to take risks in order to achieve a desired goal, but they also understand that taking unnecessary risks can be unwise. For example, if one wishes to establish a successful business, it would not be wise to invest all of one's savings in a single venture without doing sufficient research or considering available alternatives. Instead, successful entrepreneurs often begin with a small-scale project and then use that as a platform to test new ideas and approaches. This allows them to try out new strategies without risking the entire enterprise.

At the same time, successful people also understand the importance of honing existing skills. This includes not only developing the technical skills necessary for their chosen field, but also the emotional, interpersonal, and organizational skills necessary to effectively manage their projects and teams. This may involve learning how to better communicate with colleagues and customers, developing the ability to motivate a team, or developing new innovative strategies that have the potential to revolutionize their respective industries.

Ultimately, success requires a balance of both risk-taking and focus on developing existing skills. Taking risks can lead to rewarding successes, but one must also understand that not all risks are wise and that developing existing skills is an essential part of the success equation. Successful people understand this, and as a result, they are both willing to explore new opportunities and to hone their existing skills with the goal of achieving success.",1
"Being true to yourself is one of the most important things you can do, both for yourself and for those around you. It’s about being honest with yourself and other people, and being genuine in all aspects of life. When we pretend to be something we’re not, the consequences are serious and can cause lasting damage to our relationships with others and our own wellbeing. It can cause us to feel inauthentic and untrue to ourselves, creating confusion and doubts about our own determine life paths.

On the other hand, being ourselves allows us to be fully accepted and understood by the people in our lives. We can openly express who we really are, no matter how seemingly small. When we do this, we can start to establish long lasting meaningful connections and relationships with other people. We can also learn how to respect and value our own opinions and perspectives, instead of constantly worrying about what others think. 

Ultimately, being true to yourself is essential to our wellbeing and to our relationships. It helps to create authenticity, which is something that should not be taken lightly. Being genuine comes from within and it can only be expressed externally when we are also true to ourselves. We must embrace our authentic selves and take the courage to express them to others.",1
"Education is a crucial aspect of human development. It equips individuals with knowledge and skills that are essential for success in life. In the modern era, the debate on what students should learn in school has shifted from an emphasis on memorization of facts to an emphasis on understanding ideas and concepts. While some people believe that students should learn facts, others argue that it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts. In my opinion, understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. This essay will provide reasons and examples to support this view.

Firstly, understanding ideas and concepts is more important because it promotes critical thinking. When students learn facts, they are simply memorizing information without necessarily understanding the underlying ideas and concepts. On the other hand, when students understand ideas and concepts, they can apply them to various situations and analyze them critically. This critical thinking skill is essential for success in the real world. For instance, a student who understands the concept of supply and demand can analyze market trends and make informed decisions about their investments.

Secondly, understanding ideas and concepts is more important because it promotes creativity. When students understand ideas and concepts, they can use them in creative ways to solve problems. For example, a student who understands the concept of probability can use it to design a game or predict the outcome of a sports event. Creativity is an essential skill in the modern era, where innovation is highly valued.

Thirdly, understanding ideas and concepts is more important because it promotes long-term retention of knowledge. When students simply memorize facts, they tend to forget them quickly. However, when students understand ideas and concepts, they are more likely to retain the knowledge for a long time. This is because understanding ideas and concepts allows students to make connections between different pieces of information, which makes it easier for them to remember.

In conclusion, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Understanding ideas and concepts promotes critical thinking, creativity, and long-term retention of knowledge. While facts are important, they should be taught in the context of ideas and concepts. By doing so, students can develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter and apply it to real-world situations.",1
"The proliferation of streaming services has revolutionized the way we consume entertainment. Now, people can access a seemingly endless variety of content at the click of a button. But what's been lost in this shift to online viewing? The unique communal experience provided by movie theaters. Movie theater outings have long been an integral part of American culture. From going on dates with that special someone, to family trips and school field trips, there’s something magical about watching movies on the big screen with other people around you. It fosters a sense of community; strangers come together in one room to share an emotional journey within a predetermined timeframe—from start to finish, everyone is experiencing it simultaneously. Although streaming platforms provide us with convenience and accessibility like never before, they cannot replace this collective emotion which is so tightly embedded into the social fabric of society. Going to go see a movie in theaters requires more effort than simply pressing “play” from your couch; it involves getting dressed up (or not) for some quality time away from home or work that creates memories that last longer than just two hours running time. In addition to providing emotional experiences shared between audiences members alike, movie theaters also offer exclusive perks such as comfy reclining chairs or surround sound systems—luxuries that can't be found when streaming digitally at home! Plus there are concessions stands where customers can enjoy their favorite snacks while waiting for their film to begin; popcorn anyone?. Overall, while digital media consumption offers unparalleled amounts of convenience and control over how we view our movies and shows today–there's still something irreplaceable about catching new releases on the big screen with others alongside you who are similarly invested in every twist and turn along the way! While streaming services may dominate modern day entertainment consumption habits–the unique experience provided by traditional movie-going will always remain near & dear for those seeking out these culturally integrated experiences shared amongst friends and strangers alike!",1
"Technology has given us humans positive and negavtive effects in life. For example Bullying is serious and negavtive effect on us, Bullying isn't just physical contact there is cyber bullying and that's were the technology come in. Another negative effect that technology has given us is No Contact, The new genration does not have contact as like people would have had before. We need contact becuase it shows that we can work with people and it also shows that we are social.

One positive thing about technology is new research for example now a days we can just go on google and search up things we might need help with, For example if you are confused over a topic or you want to know a little bit more about it you can just go on google and search it up. Another positive effect technology has given us is Locations, Locations is a part of everyday's life for example if you need to go somewhere you can just go on your phone and search up the name of the place where you want to go. Technology is something we need now a days because there's creations all over the world being created everyday.

Human contact is what we expect but now a days we can't find that because it either go on snapchat, instagram, or add a friend on facebook even adults do this not just kids and teens. Human contact is something that we need everywhere in life we need these things at work,school,sports teams and more. So human contact can be limited now days but there isn't any change becaue more and more techonlogy keeps coming towards our way and we can't stop it.

In conclusion this is what I think about technology ive given positive and negative feed back about technology on human contact.",0
"Few days ago I happened to read a thread on a bbs; girls were showing the stuff in their handbags. I was curious, so I decided to check it out.

I was surprised to see that there were a lot of girls who said that it was easier to carry a handbag in the past, and that they didn't have to worry about stuff falling out of their bags. But I also noticed that most of the girls in this thread were from the US. So I thought to myself, why is it that girls from other countries seem to have a different opinion on the matter? I mean, it's not like they don't know what they're talking about, right? Well, let me tell you what I found out when I went to the internet to find out more about this topic.

First of all, there is no such thing as a handbag as we know it today. It's just a piece of luggage that you carry with you everywhere you go. In the old days, people used to use a bag that was made of leather or canvas. These bags were made to be carried on your back, but they were also used for other purposes. For example, they could be used as panniers for a horse or a carriage. They could also be hung from a tree to protect your belongings from rain or snow. Nowadays, we carry our bags with us in our pockets, purses, backpacks, briefcases, etc. There are many different types of bags out there, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Some of them are designed for carrying heavy stuff, while others are meant for light stuff. The main thing to keep in mind is that the bag you choose should be comfortable for you. If you're carrying a heavy bag, you should make sure that your shoulders and back aren't hurting from all the weight. On the other hand, if your bag is light and you can carry it easily, that's a good thing, because you'll be able to move around more easily and get more done. You should also think about what kind of stuff you want to bring. Do you really need a laptop bag? Or do you just want something that will fit in your pocket? If the answer is yes to either of those questions, then go ahead and go for it.",1
"DEAR,SENATOR

I overheard that you are thinking on should we keep the electoral college or not use it any more. the electoral college is the amount of popoltaion  a state has. the distrct of columbia has only 3 beacause its not a state . in my opinino i think its stupid that you have to vote on the population , aka a president cant just have a state like florida or ct just have a state like florida or cali. now its true that the presidental election is very important  but it shouldint have to be taken like this . the presidents always pick the states with the most population or points. yes i think that the electoral college is useless maybe in a draw or something. but the vote should count for everyone no matter what state there in. the state is not the points the people are . most states dont have any campanie ads any where cuz they know that they dont hav e much points .other parties like green party and the tea party they should be more out htere the just demo anf rep. the elector college is widely know as a non-democratic way to vote for presidents. othere parties are imoprtant to like the green party is one of the best ones im my opionio but they have that winner take all system. t most people diagree with the system in place but they cant do nothing. larger states get more attention then the smaller states because the president needs more points . the states not might be bigger in size but population may be bigger .",0
"Many people consider the Amur leopard to be one of the most unique species in the world. This rare animal resides mainly in the Russian Far East and China, often inhabiting areas that are difficult for humans to access. As a result, very little is known about this remarkable creature and how it lives outside of what can be observed through research and surveys. The Amur leopard has been dubbed “The King of Cats” due to its majestic beauty and elusive nature; it features thick fur with rosette-shaped spots, differing from other big cats such as lions or tigers which have stripes instead. In addition, they are typically smaller than other cat species; males usually weigh between 60-70 kilograms while females average around 45 kilograms. These animals primarily feed on small mammals like hares, badgers, muskrats, mice, boar etc., but also consume birds when available. Unfortunately however these animals face an uncertain future due to hunting and habitat destruction caused by human activities such as encroachment on land used for logging operations or illegal logging activities conducted by poachers who target them specifically for their prized pelts. As a result of these dangers only 74 wild individuals remain in Russia today according to current estimates making them critically endangered within their native range. Luckily there are conservation efforts being made by organizations like WWF (World Wildlife Fund) who are trying hard to conserve habitats where these creatures live so that they may survive into the future undisturbed by man's activities while simultaneously working towards reducing poaching incidents which hinder population growths significantly by providing adequate funding resources alongside local support initiatives. Additionally projects such as captive breeding programs further help ensure success throughout all stages of recovery process – whether through reintroduction into wild after rehabilitation/release or bringing back suitable numbers within captivity so that healthy gene pool remain intact indefinitely thereby preventing extinction events from occurring elsewhere down line if any unforeseen circumstance arise out unexpectedly later date - thus forming strong foundations upon which sustained",1
"Dear Senator, I know you have a lot of things on your mind, but I really felt the need to address the way we vote for our president of the United States. Instead of using the Electoral College, I think we should select the president by popular vote. We, the people should be allowed to control who our president is and that not always likely to happen. We can't control whomever our electors vote for. If you keep reading you will see my reasoning for not favoring the Electoral College.

First of all, I favor changing to election by popular vote because of something we might call the disaster factor. Us Americans should consider the fact about how back in 2000, there was one of the biggest fiasco of the century because of the election process. Just think about how state legislatures can just pick electors, and those electors they chose can defy the will of the people. Even if we go back even further to the 1960's the segregationists of the Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones, who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Secondly, I would prefer that he election was decided by the popular vote because some people refuse to vote. These electors are called faithless electors. They refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please stated in souce 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, in paragraph 11.

Last but not least of all, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Only because of the winnertakeall system in each state. Because of this system, candidates don't spend time in states they know dont have a chance of winning. They mainly focus on the tight races in the swing states. Back in 2000, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all, which is not right.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I would rather have the decision to vote for our president by using the most popular vote. I feel that we don't actually get to make the decision of who our president actually is. I would like to say that the electoral college is unfair, irrational and outdated. All in all ,My opinion is that Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! Any way I really hope you take this in consideration, not just for me, but for the people.",0

"It is often said that young people enjoy life more than their older counterparts, but whether or not this is true ultimately comes down to personal experience. In my opinion, this statement is largely true, as young people often have the luxury of living life with fewer responsibilities and worries, allowing them to explore and savor life more fully.

One primary reason why young people are able to enjoy life more is that they generally have fewer responsibilities. Young people are often still in school, which typically comes with fewer obligations than a job or family. They often don't have as many financial responsibilities, and they may not have to take care of a home or children. This lack of responsibility often translates into a greater freedom to explore and enjoy life. For example, young people may have more time to travel, try new hobbies, and socialize with friends. These experiences can be incredibly enriching and can give young people a greater sense of wonder and appreciation for life.

In addition to having fewer responsibilities, young people often have fewer worries than older people. As people age, they may become increasingly concerned about the future. They may worry about their career prospects, their health, and their financial security. They may also start to feel the weight of their past decisions, and they may become anxious about how to make the most of the time they have left. Young people, on the other hand, are often less concerned with these matters. They may feel more secure in their future, as they can often rely on their parents or other family members to provide support if needed. This lack of worry allows young people to focus more on the present and savor the experiences of life.

Finally, young people often have more energy than older people. This greater energy can translate into a greater capacity for joy and excitement. Young people may have the physical and mental energy to take on new challenges, explore new places, and try new activities. They may also have the energy to stay up late, have fun with friends, and get involved in exciting projects. All of these experiences can create a greater sense of enthusiasm and appreciation for life.

In conclusion, I believe that young people often enjoy life more than older people. This is largely due to the fact that they typically have fewer responsibilities, worries, and more energy. As a result, they often have the opportunity to explore and savor life more fully.",1
"Throughout life, first impressions are incredibly important. The way a person is initially perceived based on looks, body language, and attitude all play a significant role in how they are initially viewed. However, while looks and body language are the ones that are usually noticed first, it is ultimately the attitude and communication skills of a person that can completely change a first impression. 

When it comes to looks, it is often said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Finding someone attractive or not can depend upon someone's individual opinion or preferences. However, a person's fashion sense, the clothes and accessories they wear, and even their grooming habits, can also change the way they are perceived. By making straightforward changes in all of these areas, one's initial impression can be improved. 

A person's personality may also be a factor in changing a first impression because it is often easier to see a person's true nature once conversation has been established. Someone who is animated and interesting can be much more attractive than someone who is shy and withdrawn. If a person can show that they are genuinely sociable, open-minded, and well-rounded, this can often counter any experience or appearance that was negative at first. 

Finally, communication skills play a big part in how a first impression is perceived. The ability to articulate one's thoughts and communicate clearly can be a very powerful tool in making a positive impression. It is usually impossible to hide questionable communication skills, so by honing this aspect of one's personality, it is possible to make a lasting impression. 

Therefore, through one's looks, personality, and communication, a first impression can and should be managed so that an individual can make the best possible impact when meeting someone for the first time. By making just a few minor changes, a lasting impression can be left on another person that can outshine any first impression based on initial appearances.",1

"Dear,

State Senator

I think that we should keep this electoral college because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

On the other hand it would be way easier for people to vote. Also a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. Plus, each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. So this would be perfect for everyone to vote.

After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ' certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of theelectors in december of the election year. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election.

Also, most States have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate. however, maine and Nebraska each have a variation of 'proportional representation'.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word 'state' also refers to the district of columbia.

so i really do think that we should keep this it would be a really good thing to keep.

but this is why i think that we should keep it.

"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Evidence from Around the World

The modern world, heavily reliant on motor vehicles, is witnessing a transformation in thinking about transportation. Across the globe, from German suburbs, to Colombian capital cities and beyond, the value of reducing car usage is being recognized. These initiatives not only support environmental sustainability but also contribute to the enhancement of community life, reduction of pollution, and introduction of alternative, healthy modes of transportation.

Initiatives such as the one implemented in the Vauban district in Germany illustrate the potential advantages of limiting car usage on a large scale (Rosenthal, 2009). By implementing “smart planning” strategies such as reducing parking facilities and promoting walking, 70% of Vauban’s families have given up car ownership, leading to less pollution and a more serene community environment. This initiative has exhibited a unique treatment of suburbs, proving that life in such areas can still thrive without absolute car dependency.

While car usage reduction can be seen as an “experimental” situation in places like Vauban, its previse is being adopted worldwide to make suburbs more accessible and less car-dependent. The US Environmental Protection Agency promotes “car-reduced” communities, aiming to balance out the majority of appropriations given to highways in transportation bills (Rosenthal, 2009). If realized, such changes could significantly decrease the US’s greenhouse gas emissions, which count transportation as the second largest source (Rosenthal, 2013).

A direct effect of limiting vehicle use can be witnessed in cities like Paris, where a partial driving ban lifted smog rivalling that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities globally (Duffer, 2014). This drastic measure, repeated on different days according to the car's license plate number, illustrates the immediate results that car-reduction strategies can offer in enhancing air quality.

Bogota, the capital of Colombia, offers a yearly car-free day where citizens exclusively use alternative modes of transportation, boosting public spirit and drastically reducing pollution in the process (Selsky, 2002). This not only promotes alternative means of commuting but also revitalizes the city with an air of communal cooperation. This strategy has even sparked interest in other city authorities from around the world, who may adopt the event in their cities.

Finally, the United States also appears to be experiencing a cultural shift toward limiting car usage by seeing fewer car purchases, less driving, and a decrease in issued licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend, if perpetuated, could contribute substantially to achieving environmental sustainability goals. In acknowledgment of this shift, car companies are expanding their product ranges and beginning to label themselves as “mobility” companies (Rosenthal, 2013).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across varied global contexts. From air pollution reduction to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and the revamp of community life, these initiatives present compelling reasons for further exploration and consideration for adoption by other cities and nations globally. As awareness grows, the possibility of even greater collaborative steps towards a world with less car-dependent economies seems increasingly attainable.",1
"Winston Churchill once said success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, Meaning success can only be achieved by having few mistakes along the way. Many believe achieving success means doing everything perfect and not making one single mistake, having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful because one can learn from the mistakes that are made and helps improve to achieve something better.

To be successful, there will be some mistakes in the journey but when those mistakes are made learning from them is the best way to accomplish your goal. For example, when one is constructing a house but have little knowledge on construction, the one building the house will mess up and fail at times but the best way to finish something is to learn from what went wrong. To clarify, to accomplish a certain goal, learning from the mistakes along the journey is the best way to do it. Not only learning from mistakes help be successful but it also helps improve one another.

Improvement is a big key in success. Failure will always have a role in success but it happens to help improve to become or do something better. For example, famous altheles in sports make mistakes in games all the time, but from the failures in the past, pro altheles train to improve more to become better and to not make the same mistakes again. In other words, failure may be the worse but it's a way to show what to improve. From mistakes made in the past one will become better or do better than expected.

Having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful. Failure will play an important role during the journey of success but you learn from mistakes and improve to be better, success isn't perfect, the little mistakes along the way are actually the things that make one get to the top and become successful.",0
"I think that the ability for computer to be able to read and calculate human emotions is a step towords the future and is a good thing. I beleve this will help us as humans in unlocking coads in old paintings to better understand them. I also beleve that this new tecnology will help prevent suicide.

For example in the atricle it talks about how they can unlock the Mona Lisa's smile and calculat her emotions. This is one way that the new tecnology will help us better undersand just who the Mona Lisa was. for years the Mona lisa has remaned a mistery to all of mand kind along with many other paintings. This is why I beleve that this new since of tecnology will expand our mind as far as history,knologe and also it will help us better understand ourselfs as humans and why we think and feel the way we do. This new form of tecnology I beleve is the step towerds a new begining.",0
"Yes, I belive that we should use technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It seems like a good result to add to schools. Even more other than just schools people jobs and different areas.

My reason for saying why we should use technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because in the text it says in pragher 6 '' A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored,''.'' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. By saying in other worlds when u get confused or bored the computer can try different things like make the lesson a little better and fun and slow it down for you and try different ways to keep u on track and in gagens.

Other reason why we should have technology to read the emoitional expressions of students in a classroom is because it even helps when students come to school upset and in a bad mood it qoutes in the texts about that saying ''By weightiong the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions(as in da Vinci's masterpiece).'' also it says in the text ''Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).'' Saying it can help you in all type of different ways far as when u are in your moods.

To finsh it up about why we should use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is because it wont to keep people up and understand whats going on and not confused or bored. Trying to keep people montived and trying to teach different ways of teaching when en the lesson get hard or not fun and the teacher do not know everything so this technology can even help the teacher out with the students.",0
"Studying Venus Remains Worth the Risk

The article The Challenge of Exploring Venus makes a compelling case that studying Venus is a worthwhile objective in spite of the significant risks involved. The author outlines the perilous conditions on Venus but argues probing this planet's secrets could expand our understanding of Earth and the formation of habitable worlds. While Venus presents clear dangers, the potential scientific rewards outweigh these hazards according to the evidence presented.

A key piece of evidence that supports continuing Venus exploration is the opportunity to gain insights about terrestrial planet evolution. Venus may hold clues to why Earth developed an environment conducive to life while Venus did not. Comparing these neighboring planets could illuminate how factors like greenhouse gases, tectonic activity, and atmospheric chemistry interact to make a world livable. Advancing such knowledge has profound implications for NASA's search for life elsewhere and efforts to protect Earth's climate. 

Additionally, directly sampling Venus' atmosphere and surface would fill major scientific gaps. Current data comes solely from orbital observations, leaving many open questions. In situ exploration allows more detailed analysis and collecting physical samples for research back on Earth. The article notes several high priority measurements, like determining the planet's interior structure and precise composition, that require probes or landers. Resolving these uncertainties holds significance for planetary science on both Venus and Earth-sized worlds generally.

While Venus' hostile conditions like extreme heat and acid clouds introduce risk, the author makes a solid case this risk can be prudent. With carefully designed, durable vehicles and shorter mission durations, probes' chances of surviving long enough to beam back discoveries are reasonable according to NASA estimates. The potential gains in understanding planetary processes, habitability, and our own planet's evolution justify continued cautious investigation of Venus. Overall, the author effectively supports that Venus science remains a worthy pursuit in light of its hazards through compelling evidence about scientific promise and manageable mission risk.",1
"The author supports the idea of studying Venus by stating the facts so far known about the planet and explaining what scientists and reaserches will do with them. Supporting this in paragraph 3 the author explains what the planet is like. The atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide, the temperature on the surface of Venus being over 800 degrees Fahernheit, and the atmospheric preasure being 90 times greater than Earth's. With those facts the author then states from the same paragraph an idea for a machine that could be used to get above Venus' surface, but still able to be within its atmosphere. From the text the author say Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles or so above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.... When the author counters that arguement by stating However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limiting insight on ground conditions because most forms of light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere....

The author then rebutls this by saying how researchers are finding out ways to make machines that can survive long enough on the surface of the planet, and they have also looked back at the machanical computures used in the 1940's during World War II. By looking at these ideas for solutions to the problem, being no human being able to get close enough to the surface without dying, scientists and researchers are coming up with different and new ways to aproach the planet and study Venus. The author also explains how silicon carbide could withstand the intense preasure that Venus has, which in turn could help the exploration and study of the Evening Star planet. The author uses the facts they've receved to give an idea of what the planet is like, and then explains what scientists and researchers are doing with that knowledge to create a device, or devices, that could get within the atmosphere, land, and survive oon the planet long enough to study Venus.",0
"If I were to be asked to share a lesson with elementary school students it would be how to be respectful, to always learn and, be good communicators.

One of the first lessons I'll share with a student would be, being respectful. Being respectful is important to you and the people that surround you. For an example, you cant just go up to your teacher and tell them give me a pencil you should tell them may I please have a pencil. Also if you don't be respectful to other people, people will not be respectful to you. The word respectful is not the only word you can use there's other words like nice, polite, and many other words, these other words are like branches of a tree that goes up to the main stem which is respect.

Another lesson I would share would be to always learn, because in life it's always important to learn. To learn can be very hard or easy because how you learn is how you move along in life. For an example, when you first stared to walk how did you do it, by learning. Another example is, when your in school your always learning new things like math, history and, writing. Learning can be fun or boring, but in life you always need to learn for opportunities for jobs. The more you learn the better opportunities you'll get.

Lastly, being good communicators. In life you'll always have to communicate if it's your friends, teachers or your family, you'll always be communicating. For an example, I can't communicate with people, for me its very hard and every year goes by and it makes it more difficult to learn. When I came to my new school it was so hard to meet new people and I don't want anyone to suffer how I did but I learned and now I feel better I have new friends and if I never communicated then I would of just stay quite. A way for you to be a better communicator is to talk more and talk to new people, its an other great way to make new friends.

And those would be the things I would share to elementary school students to always learn, to be respectful and, be good communicators",0
"Senator (Name),

I write to you concerning a topic of great debate that has come to impact the way our democratic society expresses its voice - the Electoral College system. Developed by our founding fathers as a compromise between a congressional selection and a popular vote, the Electoral College system, while imperfect, offers balance and guards against potential disaster.

Critics of the system often argue that it is significantly undemocratic. Indeed, Bradford Plumer, in his text The Indefensible Electoral College points out that the voters vote for electors rather than directly for the president. However, Judge Richard A. Posner, an advocate of the Electoral college, argues that such a feature offers a degree of security and stability - a dispute over the Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Given that almost all states adopt a winner-take-all approach to their electoral votes, even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide of votes, reducing the likelihood of conflict.

Those opposing the Electoral College claim that its 'winner-take-all' system alienates candidates from 'sure' states and disenfranchises voters. While it may be true to some degree that candidates tend to focus more on swing states, this in itself encourages a greater level of engagement and thoughtfulness from voters, whom Posner regards as the most thoughtful voters”.

In a departure from standard democratic methods, the current design of the Electoral College allows for a clear and definite outcome avoiding complicated run-off elections that would occur in the event of no candidate receiving a majority of popular votes. As Posner cites, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 won with only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, similar situations could be problematic under direct voting.

One common criticism regards ‘faithless electors’, those who defy the will of the people and vote against their state’s popular vote. However, this remains a rare occurrence, and safeguards can be put into place to limit such incidents, including binding legislation or penalties.

However, this shouldn't prevent us from looking at potential reforms like the introduction of the proportional representation system used in Maine and Nebraska throughout the states. This could keep the benefits of the Electoral College while mitigating the potential biased effectiveness of 'winner-takes-all' approach and addressing the concerns of those favoring a more directly democratic method.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College may initially appear outdated or non-democratic, it provides a valuable buffer against electoral conflict and complexity, ensures candidates appeal beyond regional boundaries, and produces a stable and definitive outcome. But it's not untouchable and should be open to improvement and modernization in order to keep up with the evolution of our society and democratic values.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Modern technology has undeniably made life more convenient in many ways. From the invention of the wheel to the internet, technology has allowed us to do things faster, easier, and more efficiently. However, some people argue that life was better when technology was simpler. While there are some merits to this argument, I disagree.

One of the main advantages of modern technology is that it has made communication much easier. We can now communicate with people from all over the world in an instant. We can also access information quickly and easily, which has made learning and research much more efficient. For example, if I want to learn about a certain topic, I can simply search for it on the internet and find a wealth of information in a matter of seconds. This would have been impossible in the past.

Modern technology has also made transportation much more convenient. We can now travel to almost any destination in the world in a matter of hours. This has opened up a world of possibilities for people who would otherwise be unable to travel. We can also use technology to make our daily lives easier. For example, we can use apps to order food, book tickets, and even do our shopping. This saves us time and energy, which would otherwise be spent running errands.

Finally, modern technology has made it possible for us to stay connected with our loved ones. We can now stay in touch with family and friends from all over the world through social media and video calls. This has made it much easier to stay connected with people, even if they are far away.

In conclusion, modern technology has made life much more convenient in many ways. From communication to transportation, technology has made it easier for us to do things faster and more efficiently. Therefore, I disagree with the idea that life was better when technology was simpler.",1
"On one hand, it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The rise of ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft has already started to change the way people think about car ownership. Many people are choosing to rely on these services rather than buying their own cars. Additionally, the development of self-driving cars could further reduce the need for personal car ownership. If self-driving cars become widespread, people may simply order a car to pick them up and drop them off at their destination, rather than owning a car that sits idle for most of the day.

Another factor that could lead to fewer cars in use is the increasing popularity of electric bikes and scooters. These vehicles are becoming more common in cities around the world, and they offer a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative to cars. As more people start using electric bikes and scooters, they may choose to give up their cars altogether.

On the other hand, there are also reasons to believe that there will not be fewer cars in use in twenty years. Despite the rise of ride-sharing services and electric bikes, many people still prefer the convenience and comfort of their own cars. In some areas, public transportation options are limited, making car ownership a necessity. Additionally, while self-driving cars may become more common, it is unlikely that they will completely replace traditional cars in the next twenty years.

Another factor to consider is the growth of the global population. As more people are born and more people move to cities, the demand for cars may actually increase. While there may be fewer cars in use in some areas, overall demand for cars could continue to rise.

In conclusion, it is difficult to predict whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. While there are certainly factors that could lead to a decline in car ownership, there are also reasons to believe that demand for cars will remain strong. Ultimately, the future of cars will depend on a variety of economic, social, and technological factors that are difficult to predict with certainty.",1
"In the article the author writes about the possiblity of the exploration of Venus and how it can contribute to scientific studies. He uses many detail from reliable sources like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for example. The author seems like a very reliable source to listen to about the exploration of venus.

The author explains to us the danger of Venus exploration by talking about the tempature,atmospheric pressure, constant storms and volcanos. The author then explains to us the readers NASA plans of sending a blimp like vehicle that can fly over Venus without the threat of ground conditions of the planet. He tells us the benefits of such a expedition like it would further understanding of the planet that we dont know much about.

In conclusion of all the danger the author tells us that it is possible to explore from a distance even though it will be difficult and challenging it possible and he shows us exploring Venus could be very valuable to the human race and could contribute to further space exploration.",0
"Studing Venus is a challenge that scientists are discussing. The author bealives that Venus could be the nearest planet to visit. Visiting Venus could lead us to many different discoveries about Venus and its earthly features. The author claims that humans should meet the very edge of imagination and innovation. Studing venus could lead to new discoveries despite the dangers.

There are many factors to studying venus. Despite the danger NASA is working on approces to visit Venus. Venus Atmosphere has highly corrosive sulfuric acid as the autor describes the atmosphere. In paragraph 4 it expains how Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus could be the closest plant to visit.

Despite the many dangers Venus has scientist are still striving to visit Venus. NASA could make many discoveries/accomplishments on their journey to visiting Venus. Visiting Venis could benfit us in technological ways. Visiting Venus could be a deadly mission but it's not impossible.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons For Urban Sustainability

The familiar hum of automobiles, a sound that has become synonymous with urban life, is noticeably absent in certain corners of our world, and for good reason. The carless Suburb of Vauban in Germany illuminates the very possibilities of urban living stripped of automobile dependence. A place where space is utilized for interaction rather than parking, Vauban provides a glimpse into the numerous environmental, social, and health benefits that can be reaped by limiting automobile usage.

Firstly, automobile dependence has been identified as a significant contributor to the global climate crisis. Generating 12% of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions, passenger cars contribute substantially to air pollution and global warming (Rosenthal, 2009). Furthermore, in some automobile-intensive areas of the US, this figure rises to a shocking 50%. Therefore, by reducing car usage, we can significantly lower our carbon footprints, enhancing the health of our planet. The clear air in Vauban is not only a testament to its residents’ commitment but also attests to the more sustainable nature of carless living (Rosenthal, 2009). This is critically relevant in a time of climate crisis where we need to leverage every available opportunity to lower greenhouse emissions and slow down the worsening effects of climate change.

Moreover, limiting car usage has marked effects on reducing air pollution at a local level. The air quality improved dramatically in Paris when a partial driving ban was implemented (Duffer, 2014). Similarly, Bogota’s annual “Day Without Cars” also led to marked reductions in smog (Selsky, 2002). For cities like these, battling with smog and airborne pollutants, limiting car usage could be a potent strategy to achieve healthier air quality and improve citizen health.

Beyond environmental advantages, reducing car usage lends itself to improvements in the quality of urban life. Vauban's pattern of life shows that communities can be more peaceful, cohesive, and active in the absence of cars. In such environments, street interactions are human-centric; children can safely roam on the streets and recreational uses of public spaces become a norm (Rosenthal, 2009). A wider adoption of such ‘low-car’ or ‘car-free’ models in urban planning can lead to healthier, happier and safer communities.

Additionally, car-free lifestyles can foster increased use of sustainable forms of transportation like walking, cycling, and public transit. This could, in turn, supports public health by promoting regular physical activity. An interesting note is the inter-generational shift seen, with younger generations showing less interest in owning and using cars, choosing instead, more sustainable commuting options (Rosenthal, 2013). This reflects a paradigm shift in transportation choices that can be capitalised on by cities to build healthier societies.

In conclusion, limiting car usage not only holds the promise of creating friendlier and more vibrant city spaces, but also significantly helps to lower pollution levels and greenhouse gas emissions. As we strive to make our cities more sustainable and livable, the strategy of reducing car usage should be integral to our urban planning.",1
"When it comes to discussing the importance of environmental awareness and sustainability, there is no better place to begin than exploring the effects of plastic pollution on our planet. Every day, millions of tons of plastic are produced for a wide array of purposes: from packaging and product protection to technological applications. Unfortunately, much of this plastic ends up in our oceans where it persists indefinitely because it does not biodegrade. The persistence and accumulative nature of this waste has caused a range of damaging consequences that threaten both marine life as well as human populations who rely on seafood for sustenance. One major consequence resulting from marine plastic pollution is the destruction or disruption habitats essential for many species’ survival. As plastics break down into smaller fragments known as microplastics they become increasingly easier for animals to ingest which can lead them to suffer internal trauma, starvation or suffocation due to blockage their digestive systems. Additionally, these particles can be mistaken by sea birds and other organisms as food leading them to consume hazardous levels toxic material such as BPA that have been found in some types ocean-borne debris. Such consumption may cause malformations or death in wildlife further decreasing populations around world already suffering due overfishing commercial interests. On top its widespread destruction wildlife habitats, oceanic debris--primarily consisting single-use plastics--can also endanger human health when consumed through seafood sources like fish fillets tuna steaks . Ingestion pollutants present microplastics may result negative reactions ranging from nausea nausea fatigue depending amount exposure individual person Nonetheless general public largely ignorant dangers posed these factors with few realizing severity issue remains today It therefore imperative people must educated about potential risks associated with consuming aquatic products order effectively prevent harmful substances entering bodies moving forward. Ultimately safety depends upon ability recognize dangers posed by improper disposal materials knowledge about steps needed reduce problem start home individuals should seek out recycling opportunities avoid buying unnecessary packaging products opt reusable containers when possible Through collective efforts spread awareness rise above status quo together create healthier environment future",1
"Venus is one of the planets that have the same density and size and used to have mountains,valleys,craters and it also used to have oceans which means it used to have life but the pressure will kill us because the pressure is 90 times stronger than ours.

It is hard to go to venus because sometimes we are farther and sometimes we are closer to venus. All of our space missions to venus have been unmaned because no spacescrafts hasnt survivded the landing longer than a few hours. on the planets surface the atmodspheric pressure is 90 time than on our own planet. venus used to be covered with oceans and had valleys. mountains and craters. NASA want to send people to study venus. a vehicle would be needed to hover across venus surface. systems made by mechanical devices will by crushed by the pressure.

So the exploration of venus will be difficult but we will soon need a planet because once we run out of material we wont be able to go anywhere.",0
"The benefits of utilizing solar energy are numerous and well documented. As an alternative energy source, solar has many advantages over traditional methods such as coal, natural gas, and oil. Not only is it clean and renewable but it also helps to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of power while providing a significant economic boost in both the short-term and long-term. Solar energy has been embraced by governments around the world due to its environmental friendliness compared to other forms of fuel generation. Unlike polluting fossil fuels, solar does not produce any harmful emissions or pollutants which can be damaging to human health or degrade air quality. Solar produces no hazardous waste materials which must be disposed of properly; rather, the sun's rays are free for anyone who wishes to take advantage of them. In addition, solar panels require little maintenance once they have been installed making this form of energy production highly cost effective in comparison with more traditional methods. In terms of economic benefit from harnessing solar power, many countries have opted for photovoltaic technology (PV) as opposed to other forms such as troughs or dishes which use mirrors or lenses instead because PV offers better efficiency when converting sunlight into electrical current – up to 20% compared with 10-15%. This higher conversion rate means that more electricity is generated per panel for a lower price resulting in cheaper overall costs for consumers using PV systems than those using other technologies such as wind turbines or hydroelectric dams. Furthermore, the installation process involved with installing PV systems tends to take less time than those involving more complicated technologies such as thermal collectors meaning that fewer man hours need to be dedicated towards setup leading further savings in money spent on labour costs associated with generating electricity through solar technology versus traditional methods like coal burning plants etcetera. . As mentioned earlier though one perhaps most important aspect about harnessing this form of renewable resource comes down sustainability: unlike conventional resources which will eventually run out completely after having been used repeatedly throughout their life",1
"The importance of self-care in the digital age cannot be overstated. With technology so heavily embedded in our lives, it's all too easy to become attached to our devices and forget about taking care of ourselves. Self-care is more than just taking time out—it involves setting boundaries with digital usage, actively managing stress levels and ensuring that our mental health remains a priority. We live in an environment where not only are we constantly connected, but there is an expectation to respond quickly and be available 24/7. This can lead to feeling overwhelmed or burnt out from trying to do “everything” at once. Setting limits on how often you use social media, emails or text messages can be incredibly beneficial for your wellbeing as it gives you quality time away from your screens and provides space for relaxation or doing something else entirely – like going for a walk! You may even find that after having taken this break from the virtual world you may have more energy when using technology later on; thus allowing yourself some respite without sacrificing productivity. Self-care also requires being mindful of one’s stress levels and developing coping strategies if they start becoming unmanageable. Taking regular breaks throughout the day - whether this means having five minutes off during lunchtime or scheduling an hour twice a week devoted solely to reading a book - will help keep anxiety at bay whilst alleviating any potential screen fatigue associated with staring at bright screens all day long! Additionally, looking into activities such as meditation exercises could help reduce tension by offering moments of stillness which provide clarity amongst chaotic days filled with information overloads caused by work deadlines or notifications bombarding us every second!. Finally, prioritising mental health should never take second place despite how easily life gets in the way. Regularly check up on yourself both mentally and physically by getting enough sleep (around 8 hours per night) exercising regularly as well as engaging in hobbies which bring joy can make all the difference when feeling overwhelmed",1
"It seems that more and more people today are turning to alternative treatments such as acupuncture and herbal remedies as a way to heal their ailments. This is especially true in the United States, where spending on natural products has been steadily increasing for over a decade now. While this trend may be seen by some as risky or unproven, there is no denying that Eastern medicine practices have been around for centuries and can offer many benefits when it comes to managing one's health problems. Acupuncture, which originated in China during the Stone Age, involves inserting thin needles into certain points of the body believed to influence energy pathways throughout your body known as meridians. The goal of acupuncture is not only to bring relief from pain but also promote wellness within your overall system. By releasing tension in cramped muscles and encouraging circulation, practitioners believe that acupuncture can help with depression, migraine headaches, asthma, digestive issues and even fertility concerns. Additionally, research suggests that it may improve immunity by triggering stress reduction responses in the body – something traditional Western medicine often overlooks due to its focus on symptom-based treatments rather than treating underlying causes of illness. Herbal remedies have also become popularized amongst those seeking an all-natural approach to care for their bodies without needing expensive medications or procedures like surgery or radiation therapy (both common forms of Western medical intervention). Herbs provide key nutrients required by our bodies while being much gentler on our systems compared with chemical drugs prescribed by doctors; they also come with fewer risks associated with side effects or drug interaction complications. Some examples include ginger root which helps reduce nausea caused by migraines or morning sickness; licorice root used for immune system support; turmeric used for gastrointestinal issues such as indigestion; ginkgo biloba taken to boost memory recall; echinacea used for cold prevention; peppermint oil ingested orally or applied topically (on skin) for muscle pain relief – just name a few!.

"Making Mona Lisa Smile

In The article Making The Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto how the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions that this new technology is valuable.

The Mona lisa demonstration really intended to bring a smile to your face this while just imagine how a computer knows when you're happy or sad thats crazy. For example, if you smile as soon as a web ad appears on the screen another ad will follow. Lets say that you frown the next ad will be different from the one you smiled on. Another thing a classroom computer can know when students are becoming to be confused or bored.

How the start of the porcess is when the computer contracts a 3-D computer model of the face all of the 44 major muscles on the model must have move like human muscles. Eckamn has classified six emotions for example anger, surprise, fear, sadness and happiness. Movement for more than one muscle is called a unit.

In fact us human perfrom this impressive called calculation we use it everyday. For example, you could tell how your friend is feeling by looking at his or her face. most us would have trouble describing each others facial trit that makes us happy or worried. Yet Dr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo Da Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emoitions.

However the new technology is valuable by telling you how what are your human emotions. For example a classroom computer can show when a student is bored or getting confused. Also it can classified six different motions. Therefore this New technology is valuable for the students in classrooms.",0
"Writing a strong and supported essay takes more than just advanced vocabulary and a plethora of facts . A strong example of this is the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus. The author did not support his topic very well, because he didn't support his main idea enough, he strayed away from the topic many times, and his information is an abundance of opinions and assumptions.

First, the author brings up his topic of  Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring. Secondly, the author ,many times, rambled on about other points that had nothing to do with his main idea. The author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that NASA is working on to explore Venus, even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to Venus. In the article it states  Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II. This entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever, which shows that the author was gettting side tracked. One reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers,and not why humans should explore Venus. Finally, the supporting evidence that the author did bring up, weren't very factual or even well thought out. One of the points brought up was Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth. The author uses the word probably which means that he doesn't know this to be a fact or not. The author also wrote Astronomers are fascinated by Venus ; this is an opinion, seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus. A good informative or arguementative essay provides facts to supports its ideas, rather than just guessing or presuming.

The author does not suport his ideas well, because he draws the reader away from the topic many times, he doesn't support his thesis very well, and the evidence he does bring up are opinions or assumptions. The author provides to much on the danger aspect of it, and he should focus more on the why aspect of his idea . So, it would be best if he looked over his essay and ,with his thesis in mind, start over from scratch.",0
"In today's world, education plays a crucial role in shaping an individual's future. It is a well-known fact that education is the key to success. However, when it comes to choosing a field of study, there is a debate about whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. In my opinion, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial than specializing in one specific subject. In this essay, I will provide reasons and examples to support my opinion.

Firstly, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help an individual to have a better understanding of the world around them. It allows them to have a wider perspective and to see things from different angles. For example, if a person has knowledge of history, geography, and economics, they can understand how different countries and cultures have evolved over time and how they are interconnected. This knowledge can help them to make better decisions in their personal and professional lives.

Secondly, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help an individual to adapt to different situations. In today's fast-paced world, it is essential to be able to adapt to changing circumstances. Having knowledge of different subjects can help an individual to be more flexible and adaptable. For example, if a person has knowledge of science, technology, and business, they can adapt to changes in the job market and take advantage of new opportunities.

Thirdly, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help an individual to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds. In today's globalized world, it is essential to be able to communicate with people from different cultures and backgrounds. Having knowledge of different subjects can help an individual to understand different perspectives and to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds. For example, if a person has knowledge of languages, history, and sociology, they can understand different cultures and communicate effectively with people from different countries.

In conclusion, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial than specializing in one specific subject. It allows an individual to have a better understanding of the world around them, to adapt to different situations, and to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds. Therefore, it is important for individuals to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects to succeed in today's world.",1
"I believe that work today is more stressful than it was in the past. One reason for this is that work now is more demanding than it used to be. For example, in the past people might have only worked 8 hours a day, but now people are working 10 or 12 hours a day. This means that there is less time for relaxation and leisure activities.

Another reason why work today is more stressful than it was in the past is because people are now working in more demanding jobs. For example, someone who used to work as a cashier might now have to work as a salesperson because the job has changed. This means that the work is more demanding and the person is under more pressure.

Finally, work today is more stressful because people are working with more technology. For example, we now have computers and phones that we can use to work from anywhere. This means that we can work from home or from our offices, which is more convenient but also more stressful because we are constantly being interrupted.",1
"Education is a process of acquiring knowledge and skills through various means such as formal education, informal learning, and experience. Some people believe that education is a life-long process, while others disagree. In my opinion, education is a continuous process that lasts throughout our lives, and I will explain my reasons in the following paragraphs.

Firstly, the world is constantly changing, and new information and technologies are emerging every day. To keep up with these changes, we need to continuously learn and adapt. For instance, a person who learned computer skills ten years ago may find it challenging to keep up with the latest software and hardware developments. Therefore, it is essential to keep learning to remain relevant and competitive in the job market.

Secondly, education is not only about acquiring knowledge and skills but also about personal growth and development. Through education, we learn about ourselves, our values, and our beliefs. We learn how to communicate effectively, how to solve problems, and how to think critically. These skills are not only useful in our professional lives but also in our personal lives.

Moreover, education is not limited to formal schooling. We can learn from various sources such as books, documentaries, seminars, and workshops. We can also learn from our experiences, both good and bad. For example, a person who has failed in a business venture can learn valuable lessons that can help them succeed in the future.

Finally, education is a fundamental human right, and everyone should have access to it. Education is not only about getting a job; it is about empowering individuals to make informed decisions and participate fully in society. Lifelong learning can help individuals improve their lives and the lives of those around them.

In conclusion, education is a life-long process that lasts throughout our lives. It is essential for personal growth, professional development, and societal participation. Therefore, we should embrace education and continue learning throughout our lives.",1
"Every four years there is an election held for the next president. Citizens across America vote for the canidate they best see fit to be president. Many may not know but there is another process other than voting to select a president. When people vote for a president, they are actually voting for a elector. That elector then votes for the next president, and this is called The Electral College System. The Electoral College System should no no longer be part of the election process, but instead have election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

When a president is elected it does not just effect the government, but also the people of America. The president that is chosen makes decisions for the people, and that is why so many people vote on who will be making those decisions. The Electoral College System greatly effects that vote of presidency. In The Indefensible Electrol Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Pradford Plumer states that Voters vote not fo the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the persident. People are not getting the chance to vote, because the electors are the ones voting for them. The people should have a turn to vote for the next president.

Many people today are all toward the Electoral College System. People think that it is a great way and very helpful when it comes to the elections. The Electorical College seems fair to some people, even if the president most voted for was not elected like back in 2000. The electors to them help find a new president with other electors in Congress. The electors even have the chance to vote for the other canidate even if the people do not vote for that canidate.

However many people may be towards the system, but others are also against it. The electors go to Congress and vote for the next president. It is even possible that the canidate most voted for by the people could not be voted for by the electors. The electos haave the finall sya, even if that means not voting for who the people are voting for. This is an issue that should no longer be, but instead have popular vote.

The Electoral College Sysytem should be removed from the presidential election, and replaced with popular vote. The Electoral College System does not help, but prevents the canidate most voted for to be ellected. Popular vote from the people should decide who the next president of the United States should be.",0
"Do you think others thoughts are worth hearing? Would you trust someone else's opinion? These are some questions for you to think about. Seeking others for advice to make a better choice is helpful because you get more than one point of view, you have someone you can rely on, and will have better thoughts on different situations.

You're getting someone else's perspective. This gives another persons opinion on the situation. Another persons opinion almost always overrides your own because they are giving you a different thought in your mind and it makes you second guess your own thought. It's a reliable source to use when you are in a tight spot. A reliable source is something or someone that you can trust to be right and it helps get great information out of. This gives you better ideas on how to do things differently. Sometimes better ideas that others say is all you need because if you have a better idea on how to handle things differently you have a better solution. A different perspective is like good cop bad cop they look at things differently.

You have a dependable person to talk to. Sometimes all someone needs is to be heard. Good listeners are always a good thing because they will listen to the things you say and will try to problem solve. Someone you trust and know will help you out. Almost all the time a person you can trust is the right person to talk to because you know they won't judge you and will help you clear things up. Someone you can rely on even if you are in a rough spot. A person that is reliable and you know you can depend on them for anything is always a keeper because they are the people who will help you make the right choices and will keep you on the right path. Having a dependable person is like having a conscious it will tell you right from wrong.

Dozens of peoples opinions are not always reliable. However, some people might say that a lot of people are not always a reliable source. It depends on who you chose to get advice from. People who you don't trust or depend on. These are the people you should not get advice from because they are not a dependable source and you do not know if they will lead you down the wrong path.

Seeking others for advice to make a better choice is helpful because you get more than one point of view, you have someone you can rely on, and you will have better thoughts on different situations. People who chose to make better choices and ask others for help succeed in life more than people who don't. Better choices lead you down a successful path and asking others for advice when you think something is wrong is the first way to get there.",0
"Do you think that people would rather have the popular vote for the president of the United States or the Electoral College? If some of you guys dont know what an Electoral College is, then it is a process, not a place. The process consists of the selection of the electors, by the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Now that you know its basiclly like your not even getting to have a chance at what you want, and not even a chance at getting to say what you want. That is why you would agree with me on the fact that we no longer should have the Electoral College. The voters & people in our country should strongly agree with having the election by popular vote. I think this because the Electoral College is unfair to voters and also the people in our country. Their are many of reasons on why I chose for it to be changed. One reason is because letting it be by popular vote might decress the conflict between people when one doesn't get what they want also might help the election be more equal. My next reason on changing the Electoral College is because if they run close then more people would be intrested and want more to do with the public election. It might even help the states from having conflict beween each other, and that would help our counrty out alot! We could also keep up with the candidates to make sure that us our self is picking the right person to be our presedent of the United States.

If this year goes like last year did then we might have a chance at getting to have the election by popular vote for the President of the United States. 2000 was the biggest election crisis in a century; that system allows for much worse. In 2000, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, also Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in twentyfive of the largest media markets didn't get to see one campaign ad. The Electoral college is too unfair, way outdated, and irrational. The Electoral College needs to be Abolished. Better sooner then never.",0
"There are many different ways to travel, each with it's own advantages and disadvantages. Group travel can be a great way to see new places, meet new people, and learn about different cultures. A tour guide can be a valuable resource, providing information and insider tips that can make the experience more enjoyable and informative.

However, group travel is not always the best option. It can be expensive, and you may not have as much freedom to explore on your own. You may also be restricted to a set itinerary, which can be frustrating if you want to go off the beaten path. Ultimately, the best way to travel depends on your individual preferences and needs.

If you enjoy meeting new people and learning about different cultures, then group travel may be a good option for you. A tour guide can introduce you to local customs and history, and help you navigate your way around unfamiliar territory. Group travel can also be a great way to save money, as many tour operators offer discounts for large groups.

However, there are some drawbacks to group travel. You may not have as much time to explore on your own, and you may have to stick to a set itinerary. This can be frustrating if you prefer to travel at your own pace and explore at your own discretion. Additionally, group travel can be expensive, particularly if you are booking last-minute or during peak season. Ultimately, the best way to travel depends on your individual preferences and needs. If you are looking for an authentic cultural experience, then group travel may be a good option for you. However, if you prefer to travel independently and at your own pace, then you may want to consider other options.",1
"Dear Senator [Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you as a concerned citizen of our state concerning the present means by which we elect the President of the United States - the Electoral College. This subject has been contentious for decades and today, I wish to voice my support for it, maintaining that we should continue to elect our President through this process as opposed to adopting a direct popular vote.

The Electoral College, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register, was established as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by popular vote [1]. It involves the selection of electors, who then cast votes for the President and Vice President - thereby presenting a method for balanced representation [2]. 

I acknowledge the criticism against the Electoral College. Critics, like Bradford Plumer, argue that it is an anachronistic system that can distort the true will of the people via the “disaster factor” and ignores voters' preferences in non-swing states [11, 13]. Plumer, and others, favor moving to a system of direct democracy where the candidate with the most popular votes wins the presidency. However, I argue that retaining the Electoral College has crucial benefits that outweigh the identified cons.

Judge Richard A. Posner, a renowned legal scholar, presents five compelling reasons for retaining the Electoral College. Firstly, the Electoral College offers certainty of outcome. As Posner points out, the likelihood of a dispute over the popular vote is more pronounced as contrasted with an Electoral College vote, due to the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeding his share of the popular vote [18].

Secondly, the electoral system ensures the President-elect has trans-regional appeal. The election winner must appeal to a broad range of regions, implying a candidate's message should cater more universally, advocating for national unity [19]. 

Thirdly, the system encourages focus on swing states that often bear varied demographics, which inadvertently promotes the representation of a broad array of voters' interests [20]. 

Lastly, it also addresses the challenge of unequal representation in the Senate by giving more political weight to large states, [21] and dodges the issue of run-off elections by creating a system that usually delivers a distinctive winner without necessitating run-offs [22].

I acknowledge that no system is flawless. However, the benefits of the Electoral College - promoting national unity, mitigating election crisis, preserving balanced representation, and fostering a robust democracy - outweigh its pitfalls. 

Thank you for your consideration of my perspective on this matter. I would appreciate any thoughts you have regarding the Electoral College debate.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]",1
"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Operating a Vehicle 

In today's society, cell phones have become nearly indispensable for communication and access to information. However, the ubiquitous nature of cell phones has also led to significant risks when used while driving. There are several compelling reasons why drivers should abstain from using cell phones in any way when operating a motor vehicle.

First and foremost, the act of driving requires a person's full attention and focus. Any distraction while driving can potentially lead to accidents that endanger not only the driver but also other people on the road. Talking, texting, or otherwise interacting with a cell phone diverts the driver's eyes from the road as well as their hands from the steering wheel. Even seemingly simple tasks like checking notifications or changing the music can be dangerously distracting at high speeds. 

Scientific studies have shown that driving while using a cell phone reduces reaction times and situational awareness to similar levels as drunk driving. In fact, data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicates that cell phone use is a leading factor in car accidents annually. Texting while driving in particular makes a driver 23 times more likely to be involved in a collision. With so much evidence that phones impair driving ability, the risks are simply too high to justify their use behind the wheel.

Allowing any cell phone use also makes it difficult to enforce more restrictive policies against texting or handheld phone conversations. Drivers may claim they were just changing songs or accessing maps when seen on their phones by law enforcement. A total ban creates a clear standard and eliminates loopholes and arguments over what activities are truly hands-free. 

In summary, the dangers of cell phone distractions while driving far outweigh any perceived importance of access to phones. For the safety of all citizens that share the road, drivers must abstain from cell phone use entirely when operating a vehicle. Public safety should be the top priority in deciding responsible policies around this issue.",1
"The automobile industry has been an integral part of modern transportation for over a century. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the environmental impact of cars, the rise of ride-sharing services, and the development of autonomous vehicles. These factors lead some people to believe that there will be fewer cars on the roads in the future. In this essay, I will explain why I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

Firstly, the global push for reducing carbon emissions is a significant factor that will lead to a decrease in car usage. Governments worldwide are introducing measures to reduce the number of cars on the road and promote the use of public transport, cycling, and walking. For instance, some countries are imposing higher taxes on vehicles with high fuel consumption, while others are offering incentives for electric and hybrid cars. According to the Global EV Outlook 2021 report, the number of electric cars on the road worldwide has increased from 17,000 in 2010 to over 10 million in 2020. This trend is expected to continue, and electric cars are projected to account for over 50% of new car sales by 2040.

Secondly, the rise of ride-sharing services like Uber, Lyft, and Didi Chuxing is changing the way people think about car ownership. Instead of owning a car, people are choosing to use ride-sharing services as a more convenient and cost-effective option. A study by the University of California, Berkeley, found that each shared car replaces nine to thirteen individually owned vehicles, reducing the number of cars on the road. Ride-sharing services are also making it easier for people to live without a car in urban areas, where public transport is readily available.

Finally, the development of autonomous vehicles is another reason why there will be fewer cars on the road in the future. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, decrease traffic congestion, and make better use of road space. They can also be used for ride-sharing services, reducing the need for individual car ownership. According to a report by the Boston Consulting Group, autonomous vehicles could reduce the number of vehicles on the road by up to 60% by 2030.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why there will be fewer cars on the road in twenty years than there are today. The global push for reducing carbon emissions, the rise of ride-sharing services, and the development of autonomous vehicles are all factors that contribute to this trend. While cars will still be an essential part of transportation, their usage is expected to decrease as people opt for more sustainable and convenient alternatives.",1
"To whome this may concern the electoral college is out dated and unfair. Examples of this would be that bias can take up a  big part of it. For example if an electoral does not like who is running for president on the winning side they can bend the votes into there favor. Another example would be in the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of representives witch would be another unfair vote, beacuse each representive stands for everyone in the state. So if the representive in MA was demcrait and the representive in TX was republican then the mjorty vote would most likely go to the republicans.

Other examples of how unfair the system is the winner take all system. Reasons it is unfair is that the the running candidates don't go to states if they no they are going to win or not. Some states don't even get to see the adds for some candudates beacuse that stat mjorty is either repubclain or demacrat. That is unfair to the people  that are in the oppsite party in that state. Futher more the system is unfair to people in states where the mjorty is something diffrent from the party they are in.

Last but not least the system is out dated. The electoral college has been around since the constution was writen but since then it has gone down hill with the bias and mjorty votes. Examples of this can be found int the two parragraphs above as well as in this one. Another example why is out dated and unfair is the people most likely do not have a say in who they pick. a reason for this would be the bias the members of the electoral have to a candidate. The vote they cast has a grater power over ours and can sway the vote to there favor is they want to. More reasons would be how the electoral college has been around since the constution. although other systems from that time still seem to work this one does not and it will continue to fail until it just stops working altogether.

In concluestion the electoral college needs to be changed due to the bias in the system along with the unfairness of the system. Also the age of the system and the fact that it seems to keep failing,And not showing any signs that it will get better. Or help with elections in a fair and approiate way. Later on in other elections.",0
"Gaining vast information and knowlege on the planet of Venus would be worth the dangers it pourtreys, because it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author explains that Venus is very valuable planet to scientists and NACA, even though all previous missions for exploring it have not lasted for no more than a few hours. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system(4). So it is very important to gain more information and data on such a unquie planet. By gaining information on Venus we may learn more about our own planet, Earth, which is worth the dangers exploring it presents.

While scientists and Astronomers would gain vast data and information if they were to explore Venus up close, exploring it is not an easy task. In the article it states that Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no scapecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours (2). Also it exclaimed that the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet and Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system (3). So it is very hard and dangous to send any kind of big technology to Venus, without it getting destroyed; let alone sending a human and explecting them to make it out alive. Even if we were able to send a probe to Venus, the article explains that Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes (3). While there are thousands of reasons for NACA scientists to give up on finding information on the planet of Venus, they still are trying new ways to make it up there, despite the dangers.

Scientists find it crucial to continue in their research, for several reasons. The main reason is becuase, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size, and occasionally the closest in distance too (2). Which makes it important to use Venus to learn more about our own planet. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,which is one of the reasons it is so earth like (4). Also it is important to learn more about Venus becuase we currently contain little knowlege about Venus becuase researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance (6). For these reasons it is important for NACA and other scientists across the world to continue to try and gain a more vast arae of information.

In conclution, while Venus has presented many obsticles for scientists to get around, they find the prize of great value. Although Venus is extremly hard to explore because of its ruff teraine and extreme temperatures. Scientists find it to be of great value because of its Earth like appeal and its unknown information. Therefore, scientists and NACA will continue to atempt to gain more data on the planet of Venous despite the dificulties.",0
"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and the environment. By reducing car ownership and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more sustainable and accessible communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on air quality. Cars are a significant source of air pollution, with emissions from tailpipes contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and smog. For example, in Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions and improve air quality for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In many cities, traffic congestion is a major problem that leads to wasted time and increased stress for commuters. By promoting alternative transportation options such as public transit, biking, and walking, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and alleviate traffic congestion. This not only saves time for individuals but also leads to more efficient transportation systems for everyone.

In addition to the environmental and traffic benefits, limiting car usage can also create more sustainable and accessible communities. For example, in the German suburb of Vauban, car ownership is allowed but parking spaces are limited. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and the community has become more compact and accessible to public transportation. This model has been adopted in other places around the world, where stores are placed within walking distance, reducing the need for long drives to malls along highways. By designing communities with a focus on alternative transportation options, we can create more livable and sustainable neighborhoods.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have long-term cultural shifts and encourage healthier and more active lifestyles. By promoting walking, biking, and using public transportation, individuals have opportunities to exercise and incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This can have positive effects on public health, reducing rates of obesity and related diseases.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can significantly benefit individuals and the environment. By reducing air pollution, alleviating traffic congestion, and creating more sustainable and accessible communities, we can improve our quality of life and create a healthier and more sustainable future. It is essential for individuals and governments to prioritize alternative transportation options and work towards limiting car usage for the well-being of our society.",1
"As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but I can provide some arguments for both sides of the issue.

On the one hand, computer games have been blamed for several negative effects on children's development. For instance, excessive playing can lead to physical problems such as obesity, poor eyesight, and posture problems. Moreover, some games may contain violent or inappropriate content that can affect children's psychological well-being and increase aggressive behavior. Additionally, playing games for long hours can affect children's academic performance and social skills, as they may become isolated and neglect their responsibilities.

On the other hand, computer games can also have positive effects on children's development. For example, some games can enhance children's cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and spatial reasoning skills. Moreover, playing games can improve children's hand-eye coordination and reaction time, which can be beneficial for some sports and activities. Additionally, some games can provide a platform for social interaction and teamwork, which can improve children's communication and collaboration skills.

In my opinion, the negative effects of computer games on children's development can be mitigated by setting limits and monitoring their use. Parents and caregivers can establish rules for playing games, such as limiting the time spent on them and selecting age-appropriate games. Moreover, they can supervise children's gaming activities and discuss the content and themes of the games with them. Additionally, parents can encourage children to engage in other activities, such as sports, reading, and socializing, to balance their screen time and promote a healthy lifestyle.

In conclusion, computer games can have both positive and negative effects on children's development. While some people suggest preventing children from playing games altogether, I believe that setting limits and monitoring their use can help mitigate the negative effects and promote the positive ones. Ultimately, it is up to parents and caregivers to make informed decisions about their children's gaming habits and ensure their overall well-being.",1
"The author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by stating facts about Venus and stating how humans are curious about studying Venus.

The author states why people are fascinated about studying Venus at first in the text.

The text states in paragraph 4 line 2-4  Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-liike planet in our solar system.

This shows why astronomers want to study Venus in the first place.

Then, the author states interesting facts about Venus in paragraph 3 to show how dangerous but intriguing Venus is.

The text states in paragraph 3 in lines 2-3 Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

The text also states in paragraph 3 in lines 3-6  On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

This shows how the author uses facts about Venus to show how interesting the planet is.

Finally, the author shows that NASA is having problems and is trying to find a way around Venus and its hostile atmosphere to uncover more knowledge about Venus.

The text states in paragraph 6 lines 1-5 However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective, and in paragraph 6 lines 5-6 state More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock,gaas, or anything else, from a distance.

The text also states in paragraph 6 lines 9-11 Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

This shows how tough it is and how hard they are working to study Venus and uncover it's mysteries.

This shows how the author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by stating facts about Venus, stating how humans are curious about studying Venus and how well the author supported this idea.",0
"The purpose of a university education has long been debated and there are many opinions on the matter. Some people believe that university education should be used to prepare students for employment, while others argue that it has other functions. In my opinion, university education should not be solely focused on preparing students for employment, but should also be used to develop critical thinking, creativity, and communication skills.

First of all, university education should not be solely focused on preparing students for employment. While it is true that having a degree can open up more job opportunities, university education should also be used to develop a variety of skills that are not necessarily related to employment. These skills include critical thinking, creativity, communication, and problem-solving. By developing these skills, students can become more well-rounded individuals and be better prepared for any situation they may encounter in the future.

Furthermore, university education should also be used to broaden students’ horizons and help them develop a better understanding of the world. Through courses such as history, literature, and political science, students can gain a better understanding of the world and it's many complexities. By learning about different cultures, societies, and histories, students can gain a deeper appreciation for diversity and be better equipped to engage with people from different backgrounds.

Finally, university education should also be used to help students develop a sense of purpose and direction. By taking courses that are related to their interests and passions, students can gain a better understanding of what they want to do with their lives and how to best achieve their goals. In addition, students can also gain valuable insight from their professors, who can share their own experiences and provide guidance on how to best pursue their goals.

In conclusion, university education should not be solely focused on preparing students for employment. Instead, it'should be used to develop a variety of skills, broaden students’ horizons, and help them develop a sense of purpose and direction. By doing so, students can become more well-rounded individuals and be better prepared for any situation they may encounter in the future.",1
"Did you know there were 4 different emotions detected in the famous Mona Lisa painting?

Do you wanna know how it was abe to be detected? Well Prof. Thomas Huang in colaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe invinted a way for computers to be able to figure out how you are feeling based on your face.

I do feel like the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I feel like it is valuable because the problem in school nowadays it the problem with being bored. When we become bored, we could careless with whats going on and we become less engaged. The text states a classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. So when the computer can catch bordem a head of time, nothing else should be an issue.

In conclusion if we can get around the fact of becoming bored we wouldn't have to worry about attendence in school, naps in school, or test scores/ grades in school.",0
"Education is an essential part of human life; it plays a vital role in the development and growth of any society. Education has been seen as one of the key drivers for economic prosperity and social progress, often referred to as the great equalizer because it offers people from all backgrounds an opportunity to reach their full potential. Unfortunately, not everyone has access to quality education which can be attributed to various factors such as poverty, inequality and other socioeconomic issues. One area where this lack of educational resources is particularly apparent is rural areas. Rural communities are isolated from urban centers leaving them without easy access to advanced educational institutions such as universities or technical colleges that could offer specialized skills training and higher education opportunities. This results in lower academic achievement levels compared with their urban counterparts due to inadequate preparation at elementary school level caused by limited resources available including teachers, books and technology required for teaching modern subjects like science & mathematics or providing special support services such as learning disabilities counseling or English language instruction – thus leading students into unpreparedness when they enter secondary school systems later on in life with very little knowledge acquired during primary years. In order to address these issues, governments must invest more into rural education initiatives that seek both short-term solutions (e.g., improving infrastructure) while also focusing on long-term benefits (e.g., creating programs aimed at preparing young people for college). Additionally, we should also focus our efforts on addressing socioeconomic disparities faced by rural communities through policies that improve living standards within these areas so children are provided with better health care options & nutrition enabling them physical capability needed for successful completion of schooling tasks. Furthermore community engagement projects like volunteerism schemes have shown positive impact towards attainment rates by giving families financial assistance & mentoring activities offered through such organizations helping create opportunities allowing youth pursue further studies even if they live far away from big cities where most university campuses reside. Ultimately, improving access to high quality education in rural communities cannot happen overnight but only through sustained investments",1
"Our country's history with cars date back a few centuries. Today, there are many cars from different brands, with different designs, and with different benefits. Though all these cars have one thing in common they emit harmful pollution to the air. We already know that the pollutantss given off from cars have caused the greenhouse effect in the world. This has been a main topic for decades, on how to figure out how to solve and reduce the amount of pollution so that Earth can sustain us. Limiting car usage will reduce the pollutants emission from the cars, it will cause less traffic jam and congestion in parking, and some people are tend to become more relaxed and happy.

The Earth is being effected with harmful gases caused by cars. Our vehicles that we drive everyday, the one we take to work or schools or places you want to see, are the main source of pollutantss coming into the air and causing the greenhouse gases. The limited usage of cars will reduce the amount of emission given off. In the article Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, France has the most amount of smog in the European countries. This smog has caused warmer layers of air to trap car emissions will cause heat to the country. But when they have put a ban in cars for a while, the amount of smog has decreased. Furthermore, if we continue to reduce or at less limit the amount of time we spend driving or riding in the car, we can help reduce the emissions made. Rosenthal states, ...emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities. If we do not limit the use of cars now, not only will the Earth suffer, people will suffer as well. The limit usage of cars can save the Earth and ourselves.

The constant honking, switching lands, and when reached the destination, a parking is needed to be found. With the amount of cars, traffic jam and lack of parking space is evitable. Pollution also contributes to the traffic jam and congestion. Though if limited cars we used congestion will come down. According to Duffer, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... The lack of cars on the road will cause many more people to get to work or school or any place they want without rushing becaus the roads are clear. Moreover, parking space is a hassle to find when there are so many cars everywhere. With less cars means less space for parking, this could save money for the government and invest more on what the country needs. In Vauban, Germany, they had to give up their cars but on the positive side, on the main streets, stores are placed walking distance rather than on a highway Source 1. With the less amount of cars, highways and roads do not have to be invested in too much rather the money may be used to invest in other important things.

When we are younger, we dream of driving and having a bit of freeedom but when we actually start driving it gets tiring. Some people are stressed out when driving and tend to be very prone to accidents. Though when just taking a bicycle or walking it relieves stress. Carlos Arturo Plaza states in the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Stress will only increase when we get older, taking off a load of stress by limiting the usage of cars can be a breather for all of us. Also, people are happy when they do not need cars. Heirdrun Walter said, When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, Rosenthal When Heirdrum means this way, she is referring to not using a car to get to places. A person should be happy rather than angry and rage because when in a car, some people may do things that could hurt them.

Roads and highways are always being invested because of the increase in car users. If we continue this in the future, there might not be a bright future if we do not stop it. The limit of using cars can cause less pollution in our air, get people to places faster, and make a person smile. This may lead some down fall into the economy and for the employees but with the increase of other alternative to get to places this can lead into a boom in the economy. The positives out run the negatives in this topic. If cars are limited, parks and sports centers will bloom uneven, pitted sidewalks will be fixed to smooth sidewalks rushhour will be cut traffic and food places and stores will increase. Even the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed parternering with the telecommunications inductry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transprtation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety' Source 4. In the end, it is up to decide if we would rather continue using cars or not. So go and choose the side that will benefit not only the economy or government but the people and environment.",0
"The world of competitive gaming has grown significantly in the past decade. Now, millions of players around the globe join forces to create powerful teams and participate in tournaments for lucrative prizes. This significant growth is largely attributed to advances in technology, particularly streaming platforms that have made viewing game tournaments more accessible than ever before. In this essay, we will explore how the advent of streaming technologies has shaped the modern competitive gaming landscape. We will look at how tournament organizers are able to keep up with demand for their events by utilizing popular streaming services such as Twitch and YouTube Gaming, and discuss how commentators can broaden a tournament’s reach by bringing attention to it through social media campaigns and live interviews during streams. Finally, we'll analyze what all of this means for professional gamers looking to make a living off playing games they love while providing entertainment value for viewers around the world. Before streaming platforms like Twitch were available, most tournaments had low viewership because there was simply no way for fans outside of physical locations where events were held could watch them live or even on-demand afterwards. As a result, many organizers struggled financially despite hosting consistently exciting matches with top competitors from various regions within different genres across multiple titles. These issues eventually led some tournament organizers out of business entirely due to lack of viewership numbers which meant less advertising revenue coming in from sponsorships and other sources that typically fund these events initially when launched into existence. . However, once Twitch became mainstream back around 2013/2014 there was an influx of new attention being brought towards both established organizations running long-term leagues as well as minor online tourneys set up mainly over weekends or weekdays depending on region availability (eases restrictions). Though large scale event participants already had access via satellite feeds prior thanks mostly thanks those provided by Electronic Sports League (ESL) , now everyone else could enjoy it too! Despite advertisements still being necessary income sources; broadcasters suddenly had plenty more ways they can monetize their content - either through",1
"Yes I am for technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

The reasonn why I said yes is because. Kids have changed, we dont like certain stuff, teachers think the kids are feeling good in class but on the inside could be the Devil and God fighting. The world is changing the future of America, and the schools should do something about it.

(Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.) ''From the article''.

Us kids sit in a building for 7 hours and 30 minutes. There is no excuse for a kid to feel like he is forced to come to school. School should feel like home, it should be a place to go to get away from bad things in your life. Me personally, I dislike school, yeah we learn the material but not everybody learns the material. Some people come here just so they have food in their stomachs. Some kids come here for relationships. Some kids come to school for fun. Thats wrong. Kids should come to learn. Learn different ways learn life materials, learn how to work with people, learn how to be great citizens.

(''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson like a effective human instuctor.) (From the Article).

I love my education . But I love my country more. The way I look at school is disgusting a descrace. The people that gave this stupid test. Should get fired. Istep shouldn't determine if I graduate. It shouldnt detemine if im smart or not. it shouldnt be based on a national level. It should be a state thing. You know why? Let me tell you why. The stuff i learn in Geometry and in English. Are not on ISTEP. This test is basically a test that we dont study for, and it really does suck that this test determines if I graduate. Its unfair.

Hopefully you take what I said to the heart and look at what America is in 5 to 10 years. Because this technology would change everything. Teachers would understand there students more. Teachers would grow that father/mother role to the students. Kids would feel more comfortable with there teachers knowing how they feal. Thank you for taking your time to reading my Essay.",0
"Do you think there is a face on Mars? This theory has been questioned for a long time. We have found odd things throughout the years of human existance and speculations towards this face has been studied.

The face on Mars is not actually a face. It is probably holes in the rock of the ground just shaped perfectly like a face underground. Even if there was a body burried under there you wouldnt be able to see the face if you dont see the body.

Why hasnt NASA unburried this object or crater to see if it actually is a body. This face is only a theory towards Mars having an ancient civilazation. The object there isnt a face, it is only a natural landform.

Have you heard of electromagnetic force fields? If not, they are locations on earth in which it radiates high frequencies and no animaml can live on this land. Human could for awhile but it might make you go insane. Do you think these are just alien sites that we cant handle? Most likely not, it is natural within earth. Our planets has its own different things throughout it and Mars could just have craters everywhere. This one just happens to be captured and looked like a face.

Do not believe everything you hear or see because our mind can trick us. Natural landforms come in all different shapes and sizes. Next time you think there is a face in the ground remember that its not actually a face.",0
"The power of yoga is something that has been explored for decades. Many people are familiar with the physical benefits associated with this ancient practice, such as improved flexibility and strength. However, what often goes unrecognized is the mental and emotional benefits of incorporating yoga into one's daily life. In recent years, there has been a surge in research exploring the psychological effects of regular yoga sessions on individuals suffering from anxiety and depression. There are many reasons why this form of exercise can be so helpful to those dealing with mental health issues. First, it provides an escape from everyday stressors and worries by bringing a person’s focus inward onto their own body rather than outward onto external stimuli or concerns that may lead to increased levels of anxiety or depression. Second, it teaches practitioners how to manage their bodies through mindful awareness which helps them recognize when they are feeling overwhelmed or tense within themselves before any symptoms manifest externally in behavior (elevated heart rate, sweating etc). Finally, yoga encourages relaxation through proper breathing techniques which can help bring down cortisol levels (a hormone released during times of stress) and promote feelings of calmness throughout mind-body connection practices like meditation or visualization exercises. Overall, while more research needs to be done to better understand how exactly yoga impacts mental health conditions like anxiety and depression; its undeniable potential for therapeutic healing cannot be ignored any longer--especially considering its relatively low cost compared to other treatment options available on the market today like therapy drugs that could have harmful side effects if taken over an extended period of time without careful monitoring by medical professionals. So if you're looking for another way to improve your well-being both physically and mentally then give yoga a try! You just might find yourself surprised at all the positive changes experienced after committing even just 10 minutes each day towards taking care your most valuable asset: YOU!",1
"What if there was a way to tell teacher's if student's are sad, mad, happy by using a computer. Something that will tell teachers if that student is confused on what is being taught.

Teens now of days hide their emotion's from parent's ,teachers, friends, anybody that's close to them. You won't know how that child feel's. Holding their emotions in, can cause problems in the classroom. Student's will lose focus on what's going on the class, thinking about thing's on their mind's.

The lastest software innovation from Prof. Huang can tell you if someone is mad, sad, or happy. All the computer need's is a 3-D computer model of that person face. Having this kind of technology to read expressions can be good in a classrooms. It'll tell teacher if that student is confused or bored. This type of technology will also tell if students are happy, mad, or sad. Teachers can confront students by asking if their okay, what part of the lesson in confusing to them.

Using this techology more kids will get good grade, even more kids will gradute. Students will be able to get work done because of teacher asking if their okay or what they don't get about what's being taught.",0
"Studies are showing that a four-day work week with ten-hour days has a number of benefits for both students and teachers. For students, having the extra day of rest can provide them with more time to relax, mentally prepare for their future, and more time to study in order to pass classes. Teachers also need more time away from school in order to have time with their families, or to provide extra mentorship to their students outside of school. It has been shown that this type of schedule can also reduce stress for students and teachers, as well as providing time for both sides to engage in other activities. Moreover, students and teachers can benefit from the three-day weekend by being able to spend more quality time with family and friends, and by having more time for leisure and other activities to renew energy and stay productive.",1
"When considering the pros and cons of deciding on a career before high school, there are a variety of factors to consider. On the one hand, deciding on a career path before high school can help students to develop a sense of direction and motivation, as they become more focused on the studies and experiences which will aid them in achieving their goals. With early career focus, they can better plan their coursework and extracurricular activities to gain the skills and credentials needed to enter the desired field. 

On the other hand, having a fixed career plan in high school can be limiting. Young adults are still developing and may discover a passion for a new field or gain a different perspective on their future path. By committing to one career choice before exploratory experiences, students might decide against a field that they eventually discover to be a perfect fit. Additionally, since career paths are constantly changing, what seems like a sensible decision at one moment in time may no longer be applicable a few years in the future. 

Overall, there are both reasonable arguments for and against deciding on career paths before high school. While there is a certain utility to early focus, there is also benefit to leaving room for exploration and change. Ultimately, the decision rests with the individual, and the best choice is likely to vary on a case-by-case basis.",1
"Greenhouse gases are a major problem all over the world. Almost all forms of transportation emit these and people are starting to take notice. Heavy, dark smog hangs over cities for weeks at a time like a depression and by just simply limiting cars on the streets for a few days, an extravagant improvement can be made. With greenhouse gas emissions increasing by the day, some cities have begun to limit or even ban driving all together, with the exception of public transportation. The environment is reaping the benefits with every car taken off the street.

After days of reaching near-record pollution in Paris, they enforced a partial ban to relieve themselves of the intensifying smog. Even-numbered license plates were ordered to stay home for the first day and odd-numbered the next. They alternated every day for one week. A fine was issued to those that did not abide resulting in almost 4,000 drivers ticketed, according to Reuters. Typically, Paris has more smog than other European cities. In this particular week, they had 147 micrograms of particulate matter versus 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. By the end of the week the air had made drastic improvement and the ban was lifted.

A more permanent display of a city wanting to improve air conditions is present in Vauban, Germany. Cars are indeed allowed, but the only places to park are on the edge of the development, and a space can cost as much as $40,000. The main public transport still runs and most people ride bikes to get around. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and as much as 50 percent in heavily populated areas in the United States. This upscale suburban city in Germany is making impact around the world, influencing more accessibility to public transportation and stores.

Warm, Bogota, Columbia makes a celebration out of a nationwide day-long ban on cars. Warm temperatures tend to trap greenhouse gases which creates smog over cities. Only buses and taxis are permitted on the Day Without Cars. Violaters also faced a fine here but millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, and enjoyed the day. This day is part of an improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. Bogota has constructed 118 miles of bycicle path, more than any Latin American city. Parks have bloomed and other forms of transportation has been made easily accessible.

In America, recent studies suggest that citizens have been buying and driving fewer cars and getting fewer licences each year. Has car culture really started to diminish? The number of miles driven peaked in 2005 and has steadily dropped afterwards. If the pattern persists carbon emissions will be greatly decreased and the enviroment will definitely take notice. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, right behind power plants. The decrease in car commuting may find reason in the recession, and it may become a new habit. Wether the millenials will buy more cars when they have kids remains an open question, but it is very much doubted.

Greenhouse gas emissions from cars are very detrimental to the enviroment and even ourselves. Just by limiting how much cars are used in ordinary day we can preserve our earth. It is apparent that people already cut back on using cars for financial reasons, why dont we begin to cut back for environmental?",0
"In cities such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, people are getting serious about cutting down on the vast usage of cars. The car free trend is beginning to spread throughout the world, and even to places in America. By limiting car usage, the state of the environment improves, a more healthy lifestyle is promoted, and opportunities for other innovations are brought into the light.

In Paris, a driving ban was enforced to help clear the air of polluants. This ban lowered the congestion by 60 percent, and according to reporter Robert Duffer, The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gasses in Europe, and up to 50 percent in areas where cars are used more often, such as the United States. The Environmental Protecion Agency is promoting car reduced communities in America, where even legislators are beginning to act. By elimitating cars from the everyday equation, one also eliminates the greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which makes the planet a healthier place to live.

With less and less cars being utilized, there are more opportunites for people to get active by biking, walking, and participating in other active means of getting from point A to point B. According to news reportes Andrew Selsky and Elisabeth Rosenthal, The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant moter, and Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks. Without cars, citizens are encouraged to get active. Condensed cities allow people to walk to their destination, which drastically improves an individual's heart health, along with aerobic activity such as biking.

An official from Transportation for America says, All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. Sociologists believe that America has passed peak driving, and cars are no longer the focus of improvement. The Internet makes telecommuting possible, which is much more convenient than using automobiles because people can feel connected without the drive. This and the rise in cellphones implies that while innovations used to be focused on transportation, telecommuting is the new big thing.

With many areas participating in the eventual elimination of automobiles, many are following suit. Sociologists believe that cars will eventually disappear. By cutting down on our usage of cars, we help the enviromnent, promote health, and focus innovations elsewhere.",0
"When discussing the role of technology in society, many people often overlook its impact on education. Technology has changed the way we learn, how educational institutions operate and what students can expect when they enter the classroom. In recent years, technological advancements have shifted educational settings away from traditional methods to more advanced learning techniques. For example, many classrooms now rely heavily on digital tools such as online lectures and interactive presentations instead of relying solely on physical textbooks or blackboard-based instruction. Not only do these technologies help teachers engage with their students better but they also make it easier for learners to access course material outside of the classroom by giving them easy access to lecture slides or recordings at any given time during a lesson. Another major benefit of technology in an educational setting is that it provides instructors with new ways to assess student performance and progress towards mastering course materials throughout each semester or term. With modern assessment tools like automated graders and quiz generators, instructors are able to quickly grade large amounts of assignments without having to spend excessive amounts of time manually grading each one individually which leads to increased efficiency for both faculty members and students alike who no longer have to wait days before receiving feedback about their work. Most importantly though is that technology helps level out disparities between those who attend less affluent institutions compared with those enrolled at well-funded schools; this ensures that all learners gain equitable access regardless where they are located geographically or economically speaking since everyone receives the same quality education due to improvements brought forth by tech-driven resources such as online libraries and cloud computing applications which provide free academic materials accessible 24/7 from anywhere around the world with an internet connection available making knowledge more widely available than ever before in human history. . . Overall, there’s no denying how much progress has been made over the past two decades largely thanks advances in technologies used within our education systems today; while there’s still plenty room left for improvement looking into future generations, this phenomenon has already drastically",1
"The latest technology called the FACS or Facial Action Coding System detects the emotional state of kids or adults. This technology is a leading way to help students out in a classroom or a work environment. This technology is supposedly able to help find the emotions of a human and how they feel by recognizing their facial features and muscles.

This new technology FACS, known as the Facial Action Coding System reads the facial features and the way humans use their muscles in their faces to recognize their emotional state, whether they be happy, sad etc. This new technology would not benefit our society today for the reason that we have careers and jobs in understanding humans emotional state, the time, money and effort spent in learning this would all be replaced by a robot or new technology, this causes jobs to be lost and people that spent their lives and money learning this career are out of a job because of a technology. FACS is good in a way to survey an area of people but not a necessity to the world today.

Although reading a students emotional state in a classroom is a good benefit and way to figure out whether or not that student needs more help or is the reason he/she are a disturbance in class or failing in a classroom. I believe it is a good thing to have at a school because kids today hide their emotions, and avoid socialization because of their emotional state, and if we have that today in our classrooms we could help kids grades rise, fights lessen, and even could stop bullying with knowing that a kid is in fear, why is he/she in fear? or a kid is sad? etc. These things help us understand what to do in order to keep the school safe and student happy in the classroom.

If the FACS is able to read students emotions and detect if that human is sad, happy etc. then yes this technology would be a great resource in the classroom or school today because of so many things happening over the world teachers and their staff should be able to use this technology to undestand their students emotions in order to help them in a classroom and figure out how to help them in academics for a better future. The article in this passage talks about how the FACS can even adress emotional views from a picture that dated back to the era when Da Vinci was painting, and this even could give us what emotion the Mona Lisa out out and how Da Vinci used facial features to depict emotion in his paintings, this could bring out the views of people back in the 1800s or even earlier.

Though I am not for this technology for the fact that we do not need a machine or computer telling us what state of emotion were in, it could be a great use in the school board today with all the violence and cyber communication that happens. The only good reason to bring this computer or technology into the public is in our classrooms to keep the students in a good school environment so that they can succeed and continue with grades that meet the highest standards so that they can have an education to look upon when they apply for a job, for that is the only reason this could even be worth the money.

Overall the technology or FACS, is a good learning tool for our school board and classrooms today, but only for the student body this could work tremendous and help our society. If there was a way to create a facial recognition system that could help our society and our criminals today and understand how they think then there is a chance that this could go farther in our world. Overall this new technology is not a good source or worth the money to put out to the public, I say this because as our world gets older and our generation furthers themselves, it is too easy to see the emotional state of human beings, we do not need a computer to say it understands better than the human body that gets study everyday.",0
"What is a normal day to you? Waking up, brushing your teeth, eating, then getting into car to go to work, right? That last object in that list, getting into your car, puts a strain on the environment, commonly known as pollution. Although the amount of strain that an individual may put on the environment is miniscule, the combined output of all cars in a city may be enough to damage your lungs! In Beijing, China, people wear masks outside to prevent inhalation of the dense smog surrounding the city. This has led to the development of the smart planning movement, in which city planners build dense suburbs in which cars are unneeded. Shops are a walk away, and your neighbor lives five minutes from your home. You may be asking Why do I care about this? I don't have heavy smog in my city. Well when car use starts to increase in your city, that will affect both your health, and your happiness.

First off, limiting car usage will make you happier. How will this make me happy? Think about this, you go through your usual morning routine, and you only have five minutes to get to work. That's perfectly fine because, good news, your job is a three minute walk from your house! This drastically reduces stress as said in this quote from In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars. by Elisabeth Rosenthal. when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Secondly, the smog from cities with high car usage is becoming unbearable. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found. In Paris, after a few days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial, temporary driving ban. On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following da y. The congestion levels of Paris were down by an astonishing sixty percent after five days of the smog. Imagine that, in five days smog levels reduced by sixty percent. Imagine what the whole world could do if everyone pitched in to this trend. Automobiles, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmisions from tailpipes....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Lastly, a reduction of car use can vastly improve the economy. In Bogota, Colombia, the local government have begun to enforce a Day Without Cars in an effort to curb rising pollution levels. This has been happening for three years, and has increased profits for small shops and eateries in the area. Because of the large number of walkers and bikers, shops were able to make a larger profit with walkins that just happened to pass by the store. This is what caused more stores to open up, thus boosting the local economy. Even businessmen are enjoying these days as stated by Carlos Arturo Plaza. It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. To end this off, cars use can be greatly reduced. It is a matter of willpower, which everyone has, but some are too lazy to tap into it. The reduction of car use will have long term effects on both you and the globe. By minimizing the time you spend in a car, you are increasing your happiness, decreasing pollution, and helping boost the economy! If you think cars are a necessity in today's shrinking world, think again. New York is a perfect example in which rush hour traffic makes it impossible to get to work on time by car. Even in new small suburbs, cars are becoming a thing of the past. Tomorrow, instead of driving to work or to the store, try walking. You just might enjoy it.",0
"Dear Senator, The electoral college was a perfect way of electing, in the 1900's. Now, we should be allowing the people of the United States decide who they want to be their president. Not only is this inequality, but it is deceiving and unfair. I know people say Life's unfair. and while it is, we should be doing our best to keep our country in line. We are already in a steep pile of debt. Obama has only made this worse. Why was he elected? Mostly because he is part of a minority. Inequality much?

U.S. citizens are being put to shame by every elector in the electoral college. We have the right to vote, for electors. And these electors barely ever follow suit. Not only do they stray from what the people want, they also take away our authority in the government. If we have the right to vote, then let us vote on wether or not to keep the electoral college. I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one who has these thoughts. I understand that I am simply a child and that you have no reason to listen to me, but if not me, listen to the rest of our country.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

passage 2, paragraph 10 As stated by Bradford Plumer, we do not elect our president. If we did, Al Gore would have been our president in 2000. If all men are equal, then why are you choosing certain people over the U.S. population. It is utterly deceiving to take our votes and throw them away, to make us think that our votes matter when they really don't. If this is who you want to choose our president, then don't have us vote.

Although people say that the electoral college takes away the chance of majority, that's how the system works. How do you think the president wins? They like to call it winnertakesall. That is a nice way to put it. The president is decided by the majority of votes in the electoral college. What puts these electors above me? I am young, but I have a working mind just like my parents. Why do my parents votes get pushed to the side and ignored? The reason is because the U.S. is a lying and unfair country. They tell us that we are the ones who control the government, yet they put our own people above us.

America has been going downhill and that is all that will continue if we dont change something. Getting rid of the electoral college will allow us to prosper. Why listen to a young teenager? Well, I know how it feels to be put on the bottom of the ladder, even if you are the smartest. America knows what is best for us. Not a few people chosen in each state to represent what they themselves want. Let us choose the president once, and if it doesn't work out, then you can continue your way. Just remember, if you never shoot for the moon, you will never reach the stars.",0
"Character traits can be extremely important when it comes to tackling a variety of different situations. When entering different environments - such as the home, the job, or the school - it is important to choose character traits that fit the situation. For example, one may need to be patient and understanding when in the home, confident and productive when in the job, or collaborative and respectful when in the school. Choosing the right character trait in any situation can also be key to success. Having the flexibility and ability to assess any situation and choose character traits that are most appropriate can improve a person's chances of achieving their goals. Ultimately, having the capacity to accurately select and demonstrate the right character traits in any environment can be a huge advantage.",1
"Some people believe that they should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life' important matters because some of they wants to do all the things perfect they don't wants to make a mistake. But I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts. The first reason that I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is that you can learn new things in your life doesn't matter if you make a mistake. The second reason that I think that the people should make their own decisions it is that a expert does know every thing about your life does know your feelings.

As you can see my first reason that I think that it is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is because people can learn new things in their life you can make a different in your life. Doesn't matter if you make mistakes you not are a perfect person. Every person learn about their mistake. Do what ever you want. The people does know what is better for you every people thinks different to what you think.

The second reason that I think that the people should make their own decisions it is because a expert does know every thing about your life. You can make your own decision. A expert can't choose what is better for and what it is not. Also experts can be incorrectly to what is tell you to do.

In conclusion, I think is more better to do your own things and do what you think is more better for you don't let people do the things for you. So, I believe that the people should make their own decisions. The reasons that I think that you should do your own decisions are 2. The first reason it is because you can learn new things and doesn't matter if you make mistake you can learn of yours mistakes. The second reason it is that a expert does know every thing about your life.",0
"I agree with the opinion that education is a life-long process. However, I do not agree that it is the only thing that matters in life.

Education is important, but it's not the be-all-and-end all of your life's journey. If you want to be happy, you need to find other things that make you happy. For example, if you are unhappy with your job, find a new job that is better for you. You will be happier in the long run because you will have more time to spend with friends and family, and you won't have to work as many hours to make ends meet.",1
"If you could, would you want to live on a different planet? Well according to the author, studying a different planet such as Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author supports his or her idea well and has many examples to back himself up. The author talks about the similarites Venus has to Earth, the dangers of Venus, and what scientists are doing to make going to Venus a possibility.

Despite the dangers of studing Venus, there are many reasons why it is a worthy pursuit. The author states in the article,Often reffered to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. This shows that even though Venus is dangerous, there are similarites that make it worth while to study, if that means one day having another planet similar to Earth.

In the article, there are many dangers of Venus. According to the text, A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. This shows the challenges of studying Venus because the percent of carbon dioxide and high corrosive sulfuric acid are too much for humans or even some spacecrafts. Another danger is the temperature. Venus averages a surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. That is beyond temperatures at which we humans can withstand. To show the severity of the atmospheric pressure, the author states, These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. These dangers may seem like it isn't a worthy pursuit but the author goes on to describe just why and how scientist should pursue Venus. The article states that long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. To add on to that, today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. This is a good example to support that the author supports his or her claim because it is describing what was and is still good about Venus. The top example that supports the authors claim is what the scientists have already done to begin the search of Venus. According to the article, NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. This supports the author's claim because despite the dangers of Venus, the scientists have found a way to study Venus at a more suitable, safer way. Maybe not as efficient, but it saves the lives of the astronaunts.

In conclusion, the author supports his or her claim well because of all the evidence and examples that are used in the text. Stating the similarites of Earth show that it is worth while to study Venus when the outcome could possibly be a planet that is like a second Earth. Describing the dangers of Venus but then talking about how the scientists can get around those dangers supports the author's claim because the readers see that even though Venus is dangerous, there are still valuable ways to study it, meaning that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.",0
"Education is an essential aspect of human life, and it plays a crucial role in shaping the future of individuals and society. In the past, education was primarily focused on memorizing facts and figures. However, in recent times, there has been a shift towards understanding ideas and concepts. In my opinion, I strongly agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This essay will provide specific reasons and examples to support my stance.

Firstly, understanding ideas and concepts enables students to apply their knowledge in real-life situations. When students are taught to memorize facts, they tend to forget them once the exam is over. However, when students understand the underlying concepts, they can apply them to various situations. For instance, if a student understands the concept of gravity, they can apply it to different scenarios, such as why objects fall to the ground or why astronauts float in space. Therefore, understanding ideas and concepts is more beneficial than memorizing facts.

Secondly, understanding ideas and concepts promotes critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When students are taught to memorize facts, they tend to accept them without questioning their validity. However, when students understand the underlying concepts, they can analyze and evaluate them critically. For example, if a student understands the concept of supply and demand, they can analyze the factors that affect the price of goods and services. Therefore, understanding ideas and concepts promotes critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Thirdly, understanding ideas and concepts promotes creativity and innovation. When students are taught to memorize facts, they tend to follow a set pattern without exploring new ideas. However, when students understand the underlying concepts, they can think creatively and come up with innovative solutions. For instance, if a student understands the concept of renewable energy, they can come up with new ideas to harness it efficiently. Therefore, understanding ideas and concepts promotes creativity and innovation.

In conclusion, understanding ideas and concepts is more important than memorizing facts. It enables students to apply their knowledge in real-life situations, promotes critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and promotes creativity and innovation. Therefore, educators should focus on teaching students to understand ideas and concepts rather than memorizing facts. This will not only benefit the students but also society as a whole.",1
"What is your favorite thing to do during your free time? Do you stay in bed and watch movies? Do you go to your community library to read books and study? Or do you just go outside for a walk?

Studies have proven that 75% of people go to parks more often during their free time. These specific people say they usually go outside to relieve stress, and get their mind off things. This is one key factor to why you see elderly people outside. But our main focus was on modern day children and why they love going outside.

Children always want to have fun, but usually with their friends. Additional to this fact, they start to create games and activities with their friends giving them a chance in looking forward to going outside everyday. One popular game from the 1800s is hopscotch, which is surprisingly still played today. Though this game was only played by girls, through recent years we start to notice not only girls but boys and adults playing this game. Though hopscotch isn't a really competitive game and can be played alone, it's better when its played with other people.

Another game played much more often is freeze tag, or tag, which consists of two teams and two catchers and played by both girls and boys. This game involves running which can improve both your physical well-being and cardio-respiratory endurance, This game isn't usually played by adults as seen in frequent surveys, and tend to be a child only game. This game is one of the most competitive outdoor games played my modern day kids.

Comparing these two games, there is a high chance that people who enjoy running would go for tag, and serene people would go on tho playing hopscotch. Though you could still play tag being a quiet person. These are some examples of what to do when you ever want to go outside, or to the park.",0
"is it right whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. The software is the latest innovation from prof.

"In The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author balances the pros and cons of exploring the planet Venus to boost the human race scientifically. The author expresses that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, making it realistic for life forms to inhabit the planet. That is, if they can handle the heat. The exploration of Venus is something modern scientists should engage in due to the potential technical advances the population can make because of the information on the living conditions the average biotic being would endure on Venus.

The knowledge scientists have the ability to gain from Venus can only bnefit us. Even the simplest efforts to explore the planet will leave us with more determination to continue exploring and feed us information crucial to the succession of the human race. Analyzing the atmosphere further can encourage adaptation and give us options of migration when our sun, inevitably, blows up. There being Many researchers... working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus, already proves the exploration to be something legitimate and worthwhile.

The risks being taken by choosing to explore Venus entertains the idea that the human race is diligent, curious, and selfless. The cause being fought for is for the benefit of future genertions of humans. With current and future technology, Venus' exploration will seem very realistic and encouraged by scientists with the same goals, giving the population a future.",0
"There is no easy answer to the question of whether the government should or should not put money into building theaters and sports stadiums. On one hand, some people argue that the government should prioritize spending on medical care and education over building theaters and sports stadiums. On the other hand, others argue that investing in theaters and sports stadiums can have positive economic effects that ultimately benefit everyone. I believe that there is merit to both arguments, and the decision of whether or not to invest in theaters and sports stadiums ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and priorities of the government in question.

Investing in medical care and education is undeniably important. Medical care ensures that people have access to the treatment they need to stay healthy, and education is essential for preparing the next generation of workers and leaders. That said, there are also good reasons to invest in theaters and sports stadiums. For one thing, theaters and sports stadiums can be economic drivers, bringing in tourist dollars and generating jobs in the construction, hospitality, and entertainment industries. Additionally, theaters and sports stadiums can improve quality of life for residents by providing opportunities for recreation and socialization.

In the end, whether or not the government should invest in theaters and sports stadiums is a complicated question. There are pros and cons to both options, and the best decision depends on the specific circumstances of the government in question.",1
"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could provide both benefits and disadvantages. 

One potential benefit is that teachers may gain insights into how engaged or interested individual students seem in the lesson. By identifying facial expressions that indicate boredom, confusion or lack of attention, teachers could more easily recognize when students need additional help or when the lesson may need adjusting. This could help optimize learning for different students. The technology may also help identify students experiencing underlying emotional issues that are impacting their ability to focus, so teachers could intervene with support.

However, there are also privacy and ethical concerns with this type of monitoring. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional reactions are being constantly tracked and analyzed without consent. Facial expressions often reflect private and subtle internal states that people do not intend to publicly share. Continuous monitoring could undermine student autonomy and the natural development of emotional literacy. It may also lead to misinterpretations if context is not considered, with teachers making incorrect assumptions about how students are feeling.

Overall, while FACS technology could provide insights intended to help student learning, its constant use to read students' emotions risks being an overreach into personal privacy and development. The benefits would need to be carefully weighed against these ethical concerns. Targeted or occasional use focused on individual student needs, with full student consent, may minimize privacy issues while still allowing teachers to gain useful insights through this new technology when specifically aimed to help learning or well-being. More research would also need to evaluate how accurately the technology can interpret emotions in an authentic classroom setting before widespread adoption.",1
"I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. There are many benefits to having a broad knowledge base, including the ability to communicate more effectively with others and to think more critically.

One example of the benefits of broad knowledge is the ability to understand complex topics. For example, if I know about economics, I can better understand the effects of government policies on the economy. This understanding can help me make more informed decisions about my life and the lives of others.

Another benefit of broad knowledge is the ability to find solutions to problems. If I know about physics, I can find solutions to problems involving physics, such as how to build a bridge that will withstand a hurricane. This type of problem-solving ability is important in many fields, including business and engineering.

Broad knowledge also gives you a better understanding of the world around you. By understanding different cultures, religions, and perspectives, you can better understand the world around you and the people in it.

In conclusion, I believe that it is important to have broad knowledge in order to be successful in life. The benefits of having a broad knowledge base are numerous, and they are often overlooked. I hope that this essay has shown you the importance of broad knowledge, and that you will consider taking advantage of the benefits it offers in the future.",1
"The therapeutic benefits of gardening are often overlooked, yet it is one of the most accessible and beneficial activities that an individual can engage in. Gardening has been proven to alleviate stress, improve physical health, and increase overall wellbeing. Gardening as a form of therapy works on two levels: physiological and psychological. On the physiological level, gardeners benefit from improved muscle strength due to the physical effort involved in digging and bending over plants; increased aerobic activity due to walking around their gardens; receiving exposure to sunlight which helps produce Vitamin D for healthy bones; and breathing fresh air with its higher oxygen content compared to that found indoors. Moreover, gardening can help reduce inflammation associated with chronic illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis by providing individuals with beneficial distraction from pain-related sensations. In addition, studies have shown that engaging in horticultural activities like hydroponics also provide sensory stimulation which promotes relaxation when conducted in a quiet environment. On the psychological level, gardening provides a sense of purpose through its tangible results which can be seen through watching something grow into fruition or harvesting fruits or vegetables successfully cultivated by oneself—something rarely experienced prior to engaging in this activity. Furthermore, having control over what is planted or grown gives people feelings of autonomy as well as satisfaction upon completion when things go according to plan—a result that cannot always be achieved outside of growing plants since life can come at us unexpectedly sometimes much beyond our control leaving us feeling helplessness or hopelessness depending on certain circumstances. For those struggling with mental health issues particularly depression or anxiety related issues they may find solace while caring for living creatures (whether they’re pets/animals), tending flowers/plants yields similar calming effects leading them down a path towards self-care instead staying stuck inside their own heads becoming overwhelmed whilst ruminating endlessly on negative thought patterns. As such nurturing plants can provide some semblance structure amidst chaos allowing individuals seeking treatment dealing hard times regain balance within life context being able maintain meaningful",1
"Have you ever been in a predicament in which you are conflicted between a problem, and you don't know how to go through with it? Many people have gone through this at least once in their life. It leads them to get different opinions in their mindset to cultivate the correct and moral thing to do. There are multiple advantages to asking several people for advice. One of which includes the fact that you can get several opinions on one topic, which would result to you either changing your mindset or understanding both viewpoints. Another advantage would be that you would be able to strengthen your initial thought. Finally, the last advantage would be that you would be able to learn and gain valuable knowledge for the next time you encounter yourself a similar problem.

The first advantage to asking more than one person for advice, would be that you can receive several opinions on one topic. Many people either share an opinion, or completely disagree with it. Furthermore, when asking other people about the same idea, they have different contentions they would present to help back up their viewpoint on the idea. When they present their reasoning, one would either think about how they present valid points, which might cause the altercation in their mindset, or they could understand the viewpoint of the opposing side, but still agree with their side. I have faced this problem before, as I was extremely conflicted if I should either help my brother understand subtracting and adding fractions or not. At first, I initially thought that I shouldn't help my little brother, because I had my own work to worry about and I had to prioritize that first than anything else. But then, I got a phone call from my mother to help, because it would help him succeed so that he wouldn't do bad on his math test. Both good arguments, but after a couple minutes of pondering, I finally made the conclusion to ultimately help my brother, since my mothers words influenced and change my mindset from not help my brother, to helping my brother. Not only is it helpful for you to get several opinions to create a different viewpoint, but also, it can help you strengthen your argument.

The second advantage of asking more than one person for advice would be that it can help you strengthen your idea. As I have stated before, many people have either the same or different viewpoints on a certain topic. Sometimes, people can agree with another persons viewpoint, which would result in strengthening their current point of view. For example, when I was young, I was extremely curious about the world around me, as I kept asking questions consistently. The only topic that I hated was math. I never gave interest about the topic, until I had my first final in fifth grade. I was mortified, so I begged my mother to help me understand it. We spent all night trying to understand everything that I needed to know so I would be prepared. Finally the test date came and I was ready. As we commenced, there was a question I didn't fully comprehend, though my instinct was to first choose the answer A. Through several minutes of pondering about the question, I finally remembered that my mother specifically told me about the question and how I should watch out for it, which made me get the go-ahead to choose the answer choice A and start the next one. Not only can you strengthen your idea from asking several people for advice, but you can also gain quite a lot of knowledge.

Finally, the third and last advantage would be that you can gain a large amount of knowledge when you ask several people about advice. No one in the world knows everything. If somebody doesn't understand what something means, they would go ask a couple of people the correct and valid answer so they would fully understand the topic. For example, I didn't understand a topic in math class one day, so I asked my older sister, my dad, and my mom to better my chances of understanding the topic more efficiently. In fact, according to a 2020 study done by Harvard University, an aptitude test given to two types on people, people that question more than one person about a certain topic and people who only question one person. The concluding results from the study are that 100 percent of the people who asked more than one person performed better than the people who usually only question one person. Therefore asking more people for advice on a certain topic is more advisable and will create the better choice.

Talking to multiple people about an idea is always the best route to take, because it can give you insight on more than one opinion, it can strengthen your opinion, and it can result in giving you a great deal of knowledge.",0
"Dear, State Senator I would for you to change the way presidents get elected to the United States of America. The reason for this is becuase, it would be much easier for the president, it would be easier on the states who have racial problems, and states who might cheat.

To back up my arguement, It would be much easier to abolish the electoral college. If the college was to be abolished then presidents themselves would be easily elected. Instead of electing 34 democratic electors. It would be fair to do that so that everything goes smoothly and better for everyone especially for presidents.

Next, it would go easier on states who have a bit of a racial issues. On some states it is diffcult to get elected because of racial issues. For instance, in Arizona there is a huge racial problem there and it would be difficult to elect different types of democractic electors. Thus making it difficult for Arizona to elect a president. In other staes it would also be the samething, just voting for the president would be easier.

My last reason, to abolish the electoral college is because of some states who might cheat. During election it is a diffiucult time because of every state wanting their president to one. That mabe the state would cheat the votes into elect those 34 democratic electors that will do anything to cheat. Another example, is in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose popular John F. Kennedy.

In Conclusion, the Electoral college needs to be abolish because it would be easier to vote for presidents, also it would be easier for states who have racial issues, and for states who are unfaithful.",0
"Making Mona Lisa Smile is an article about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify human emotions. This means that computers can use it to see how we are feeling by our facial expressions. I think that using this technology in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students can be valuable for some reasons.

Firstly, the Facial Action Coding System could help teachers understand how their students feel about a certain topic. For example, if a teacher is talking about history and sees that some of the students are bored, they can change the topic or make it more interesting to keep the students engaged. This will make learning more fun for the students and help them understand the topics better.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System is a useful tool for identifying when someone needs emotional support. Sometimes it's not easy for students to ask for help when they need it. They might be afraid of looking weak or being ridiculed by their classmates. This technology can help teachers spot these students and offer them the emotional support that they need to get through difficult times.

Lastly, the Facial Action Coding System might help students who struggle with communication skills. Sometimes it can be difficult to express our feelings using words, especially if we have trouble with language or social skills. This technology could identify the emotions a person is feeling, and then help them find the right words to express it.

In conclusion, I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom could be very useful if implemented correctly. It would enable teachers to understand their students' feelings better, offer emotional support to those who need it, and help those who have trouble communicating. Although some people may be concerned about privacy and the ethical implications of using such technology, the benefits could be significant.",1
"If you get opinions and are getting advice from multiple people,would it be better or worse. It would be better because you would not only have one persons opinion to go off of but more.

You may not agree with this person that gives you advice. They could give you advice that you may not really like.

That's why you want to go to multiple people to get advice from. When given advice, you want to at least agree with the person that is giving you the advice. If you don't you might not want to follow their advice anymore. If not just go to other people and see if they have any better advice.

One person could give you better advice than someone else. If you only go to one person than you could of missed so much advice that you could of got from someone else. You always have a chance to get better advice. That's why you don't only take advice from one person. Somene can give you good advice but there is always someone with better advice to give you.

Its always good to get different opinions and different advice from multiple people. You may not agree with them or not get the best advice ,when you could have got better. You should not go off of one person's advice. You should go off of a lot of different people's advice. It's better for you in the long run.",0
"The importance of recycling should not be understated. Recycling is a simple yet powerful act that can help to reduce the amount of waste we produce and save valuable resources for future generations. It also helps to keep our environment clean, healthy, and safe for everyone. Recycling is one of the best ways to reduce the amount of trash that ends up in landfills or polluting our oceans and waterways. By simply separating paper, plastic, metal, cardboard, glass and other items from regular household garbage it allows them to be recycled into new products such as packaging materials or building supplies instead of being sent off to become part of larger environmental problems like air pollution or water contamination. This effort on an individual level has an exponential effect when done collectively by communities around the world in order with local waste management policies. In addition to reducing landfill space and keeping harmful materials out of ecosystems there are several financial benefits associated with recycling including cost savings for taxpayers who fund city waste collection services; businesses which supply recyclable material can often receive some form of compensation; jobs are created within industries linked directly or indirectly with the process; and energy consumption is reduced compared to manufacturing from virgin raw material sources like metals ore or oil-based plastics thus helping tackle climate change issues too!. . The rise in global populations along with increased consumer spending means more resources need to be harvested than ever before so making sure these renewable/nonrenewable assets aren’t wasted by improper disposal practices should become top priority now if we have any hopes at preserving them for future generations down the line – this goes beyond just personal efforts but rather requires systemic change throughout entire societies as well!. . . Whether it's through government legislation introducing taxation incentives (like income tax rebates) aimed at incentivizing companies that rely heavily on single-use packaging solutions towards greener alternatives or implementing higher fines against those disregarding ecological regulations altogether - both public pressure backed up by monetary disincentives",1
"There is no clear answer to whether children should learn to compete or cooperate. Each approach has it's own benefits and drawbacks.

On the one hand, competition can teach children how to set and achieve goals. It can also motivate children to work harder and improve their skills. Additionally, competition can help children learn how to deal with disappointment and how to bounce back from setbacks.

On the other hand, cooperation can teach children how to work together towards a common goal. It can also help children develop empathy and communication skills. Additionally, cooperation can help children learn how to resolve conflicts peacefully.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to teach children to compete or cooperate depends on the individual child and what will work best for them. Some children may thrive in a competitive environment, while others may do better in a cooperative setting. There is no one-size-fits-all answer.",1
"IF DRIVERS SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE CELL PHONE WHY DRIVING

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, int ernet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of theset hings at the same t ime. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one t ime that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can' t put down our cell phones.

Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the drive r themselves for a couple of good reasons. When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on t he road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phoneswhether they want to or not because of the hazards they creat e. Err atic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.

As scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consult ancy

BuzzM aven Labs, says  [He] came wit hin inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of t ra ffic at 45 mph. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro (tailgating) the minivan full of kids. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestr ians.

Furthermore, there are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention.

They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating at the same time that increases threats to safety. Drivers has also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance.

Drivers demonstrates comparatively slower braking responses and also had low awareness of other traffic flowing through the roads ignoring their presence concentrating more on cell phones and less on roads as how other drivers are behaving. Different studies have reported hundreds of deaths during a year because of using cell phones during driving. It can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.",0
"Technology has had a tremendous impact on our lives over the last few decades, revolutionizing how we communicate, travel, and learn. From smartphones to virtual reality to smart homes, technology has become an integral part of modern life. But one area that is often overlooked when discussing technology's advancement is mathematics. Mathematics is not only essential for the development of technologies like artificial intelligence but also finds application in nearly every field imaginable from accounting to engineering. In fact, the use of mathematical methods in all areas of science dates back centuries with scholars such as Euclid developing geometry concepts that are still taught today. These early pioneers established many fundamental principles which have since been used by scientists and mathematicians alike to develop new theories and ideas about the world around us such as Newton’s laws of motion or Galileo’s astronomical discoveries; further advances have allowed us to explore space, solve complex equations and even predict weather patterns!. The power of mathematics lies in its universality; it can be applied across disciplines including physics, economics and computer science where algorithms have enabled powerful machines that outperform humans at certain tasks. Without mathematical models there could be no understanding between different fields leading research projects astray - instead math provides a common ground so researchers from diverse backgrounds can build upon each other’s work together creating more accurate models which better enhance our knowledge base for future generations!. Mathematics also helps us understand ourselves better through statistics allowing data to tell stories quickly without bias or exaggeration illustrating trends within populations providing insights into consumer behaviour or health issues affecting society meaning decisions made using this information would be far more informed than if they were based on personal opinion alone! Ultimately mathematics gives us insight into humanity helping create robust systems that benefit all while challenging existing paradigms opening up possibilities previously inconceivable before their introduction – an invaluable resource indeed!. To conclude it should go without saying that mathematics plays an important role in modern life whether it is aiding technological advancements or providing clarity",1
"The main way the majority of the people in our community get around each and every day, is by car. A car is the number way that people get from point A to B, but this is not the case throughout the world. A lot of countries have taken to effect the amount of damage a car can do, so they are beginning to limit car usage. They are beginning to realize that there are benefits from not having to crank up a car every time they have to go to the store thats a minute or two up the road, or every time they have to go to school, or what ever the case may be. A lot of them are coming to the conclusion that by limiting the car usage will, lower the amount of pollution and smog that is released in the air, lower the stress on having to worry about gas prices, and citizens will be more motivated to work and etc.

The amount of pollution that is let out into the air every day is ridiculous. In a lot of countries, smog has become a big issue even with out the effects of car usage. Car usage only makes it worst. In France, there was recorded to be a numerous amount of cases where they reported a lot of congestion in the air, due to tha gas that was let out in the air due to the usage of the car. Paris began to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, it was recorded that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, with Brussels having only 144 and London having 79.7. They began to momentarily stop miter vehicles dropping the amount on congestion to 60 percent.

Although the amount of excersie that is received is at an all time low. By banning the amount of car usage this pushes more people to get excersie. A lot of the people in our community always depend of the vehicle on four wheels to get us around, not realizing they have to feet. Most stores in our community are beginning to be built at every corner to make things a little bit more convenient and in walking distance, and by lowering the car usage a lot of us will have to begin to depend on walking, to get from point A to B. Which will, and can do a lot of our health in the long run.

Now many of us pass by more the one gas station a day, and begin to dread the prices of gas. The gas prices go up, and seem to consistitently go up more and more. A lot of those who work, don't like the fact that they have to give machines their money to get from place to place, and this only gets worst. Most children around teen ages who are beginning to get their liscense are not in the rush just for this exact reason. The prices of gas will only pull you down along with a lot of other expenses that people have to face everyday. Researchers have shown that the precentages in young people driving has decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

In conclusion, many are beginning to realize the cons of how much driving can do. For example, the fact that it causes pollution, has a big effect on expenses and has a lot to do with excersing and etc. Many should to take these things into consideration before they try to argue it, and realize the positive effects it may have.",0
"People in today's society practically depend on their cars to get them to and from work, to buy groceries for their families, and just for the purpose of getting out of the house. Although, with billions of people driving cars every single day, it has quite a negative effect on the environment. It is in our nature to think that without a car, you could not go anywhere or do anything for that matter. Recently, cities around the world have been banning the use of cars and charging citizens with fines if cars become in use. The reasoning for this is the increased amount of pollution that diesel fuel is causing. Thus, making it difficult to breathe, walk outside, and live our everyday life.

One major problem in the use of diesel fuel has been the pollutants in the air which lead to an extreme amount of smog. Recently, Paris has had more smog than any other European capital. They knew that something had to be done to stop this, so they started a new car-free law. This resulted in a fine of $31 for the citizens who used their cars. Soon after that law had become intact, almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and just about 27 people had their cars impounded that day for their reaction to the fine.

The United States of America had long been one of the world's most prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of some of the very first car models. A lot of big cities in the U.S have a huge amount of driving going on. For example, New York City, San Fransico, Miami, Los Angeles, ect. This is leaving the country with a large amount of pollutants in the atmosphere. After President Obama's ambitions to decrease the amount of diesel fuel use, recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and are even having a decrease in the amount of licenses permited as each year passes. In 2013, the amount of miles driven per person was about 9 percent under the usual American peak. With the large amount of citizens living in this country and the number of people only rising, this small decrease has had a very positive effect on the environment.

With almost the entire world in on this new, car-free trend, people have been perfectly fine letting go of their cars and taking on the world just by foot. In the city of Vauban, Germany the citizens there would much rather pioneer their way through life than to own a car according to Heidrun Walter, who is a resident of Vauban. I'm much happier this way. She claims. Back on the other side of Earth, people are becoming more and more encouraged to use plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more passengers. This decreases the amount of fuel being burned, and a happier and healthier environment for us all to live in.

In conclusion, I believe that the decrease in the amount of cars in use has recently had a very positive effect on our environment. This has all come to show that you don't always need a car to get where you want and to do the things that you need to do. Or, if you feel the need for a car that you can rely on a friend for carpooling or purchasing a plug-in car which are becoming much more popular and useful in today's society. Always remember to keep our environment happy and healthy, and always making each day better by putting the amount of diesel fuels burned by car use and the effects it has into consideration.",0
"The Face that is on Mars, is just a natural landform. I am here to prove that it is just a natural landform. All of my reasons will come from the passage named Unmasking the Face on Mars.

I know that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because, in the passage it is stated that when the spacecraft Viking 1 was circling it was snapping photos when it spotted a shawdowy figure like a human face on a region on the planet named Cydonia. After that though, scientisits figured out it was just another Martian mesa common around Cydonia. Next, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor Camera snapped pictures better than the ones that Viking took. Thousands of peole waited for when the image would first appear on a JPL web site. The website revealed that it was just a natural landform after all. Finally, in the very last paragraph it said, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are similar to landforms common around the American West. A scientist named Jim Garvin said it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Gavin also stated that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars.

So therefore, all of the reasons stated above prove that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It formed a long time ago and that is something to figure out in the future.",0
"Working alone or working in a group provides different benefits to student learning. Working alone can provide a student with the distraction-free environment needed to focus and concentrate on a task or assignment. However, working in a group can stimulate a student's creativity and collaboration skills, allowing for a deeper understanding of difficult topics.

When working alone, a student can benefit from undivided attention and full focus on the task at hand. Working alone will also give a student the liberty to use new strategies which would allow them to work through obstacles in their own way. Also, through self-paced learning, the student can gain a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment over the work they have put into completing the task.

On the other hand, when students work in a group, they can take advantage of being able to brainstorm. Students can work together to generate ideas and come up with solutions, usually leading to a deeper understanding of a subject which wouldn’t have been reached when working alone. Working in a group setting can also provide a student with instant feedback from their peers, leading to an improved understanding of the subject being discussed.

In conclusion, both working alone and in a group have their own set of advantages, and each student should take into consideration their own working style when deciding which is best for them. Working alone provides undivided attention and fits better with some student’s learning strategies, while working in a group encourages collaboration and group think which will undoubtedly benefit the student in the long run.",1
"In the modern technological world, it is hard to ignore the potentially negative impact that technology has had on our lives. While technology has revolutionized how we live, the side effects cannot be overlooked. One such side effect is that people are slowly losing their ability to think for themselves. 

The exponential growth of technology over the past decade has meant that technology is now everywhere. Instead of relying on our own problem-solving abilities, we are increasingly relying on technology to do things for us. As an example, the many online banking sites and financial calculators available have become the norm, as opposed to manually calculating and budgeting ourselves. This has led to many people becoming dependent on technology as a mental crutch, and caused us to lose our ability to think independently.

Another way that technology has negatively impacted our lives is how it has become both an addiction and a distraction. With the ability to access the internet and social media from wherever we are, a large portion of our days are now spent aimlessly browsing. This addiction has significantly reduced the amount of time that we are spending thinking and reasoning for ourselves. 

Technology has undoubtedly become an integral part of our way of life. However, it is important to recognize the negative effects that it can have, as this may lead to us losing the ability to think for ourselves and be self-reliant. If we are not careful, our current generation and future generations may suffer because of it.",1
"The face on Mars was actually landform on mars and not a face if you still don't believe me I'll tell you some facts. In 1976 viking 1 was snapping pictures so that viking 2 could land while doing that it snapped a picture of a landform that looked like a face. Many people thought that it was a face but it wasn't. In 1998 they took another pivture but this time it didn't look like a face it looked more like a landform on the ground. Many people thought that the landform was created by aliens many others thought that it was made just like land forms on earth.

People still thought thet they were made by aliens many other people disagreed on it until 2001 when they took the final picture and they saw that it was actually a landform Garvin said that it reminded he of snake river of Idaho.

So after that happened mny people saw the truth about the face on mars and completely forgot about it. Some people still believe and talk about it but maybe those people are just the scientists trying to find out if there is more land forms that look just like the onein 1976. Many people say that they might find another one and start the arguement that it's an alien artifact or that it's just a land mass this time. Many other people study about this things and think they find out the truth about ehy this landforms look like faces. Even though some people think there is life on mars some might be true and some of it might be fake. Some people think there is aliens but maybe in another galaxy.

Many people might still think that mars landform was a sign form aliens and saying that they exist personally I don't think there is aliens in mars or any other planet in our solar system. That was just my idea about it I don't think my statement could be true. Maybe smart kid like a nerd would say  scientists who are studying this kind of martian studies could get results of a real life alien that could be roaming around earth. That's what I would think a nerd would say or maybe he might just say it even smarter than I said it, but that is my opinion I would like to hear about more peoples opinions on the face on mars. Even though many other people will just argue over that it was a face but maybe the aliens destroyed it or just abducted it like they do in boring fake movies of aliens but that's my opinion not you if you don't agree with me it's fine with me.",0
"One of the best ways to get advice is to get multiple peoples opinions. It'll help you get the majority of what advice people have. Theres more people to trust if you can rely on more than one source. It'll also help you see whos advice fits your situation the best.

If you get the majority opinion you can see why the majority advice is most helpful. You will also see why most people offer or have this advice. If the majority of people have this advice then it'll probably help you the best. This advice is probably the advice that is the easiest or the advice that makes you succeed the most.

Its easier to trust advice if its from multiple people. The reason that is is because if your getting advice from a bunch of people if one person gives false advice you still have a bunch of other peoples advice to go off of, and so you'll know which advice is true.

It is also good to have more than one persons advice because you can see everyone else's situations and see the one that relates to you the most. Then you pick the advice that is most like your situation and see what mistakes they made and learn from them, so you dont make those mistakes. It is also important to see what things they accomplished and how you can learn to accomplish those things.

In conclusion Its best to have the majority opinion and to see why so many people used that advice and how it helped them. It'll help you trust those people if they have similar advice, youll also see how those situations relate to you most and how you can learn from them.",0
"The debate of whether young people enjoy life more than older people has been ongoing for many years. While some people believe that young people have more fun and live life to the fullest, others argue that older people have more wisdom and experience, and thus, a greater appreciation of life. In my opinion, I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

To begin with, young people have more energy and enthusiasm than older people. This allows them to take on more activities and challenges, and to explore the world more freely. For instance, young people are more likely to go on adventurous trips, such as hiking, camping, and skiing. They are also more likely to take risks, such as trying out new activities, or even starting their own business. The energy of youth allows them to live life to the fullest and to experience more of what life has to offer.

In addition, young people have fewer responsibilities and obligations than older people. This allows them to focus more on enjoying life and having fun. For example, young people are not burdened by the responsibilities of a job or family. They can spend their time doing whatever they want, such as going out with friends, playing sports, or exploring new hobbies. This freedom allows them to experience life in a more carefree and relaxed manner.

Finally, young people are more likely to appreciate the small moments in life. They are more likely to take a moment to appreciate the beauty of nature, or to simply enjoy the company of friends. They are also more likely to take risks and try new things, which can lead to exciting and rewarding experiences. In contrast, older people may be more focused on their work or family obligations, and may not have the time or energy to appreciate the small moments in life.

In conclusion, I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do. They have more energy and enthusiasm, fewer responsibilities, and a greater appreciation for the small moments in life. While older people may have more wisdom and experience, young people are more likely to take risks and explore the world. As a result, they are able to experience life in a more carefree and rewarding manner.",1
" Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a positive or negative affects on people's lives?. As we know, technology has became one of the most important things in our lives, and people now are abusing the use of technology and forgetting to contact with the others around them. Although it has both positive and negative affects on people, but we cannot declaim that our lives have been easier and better since we have had techonlogy.

First, technology are used everyday by people at all ages because of its functions. We can complete many things online by using technology such as study, entertain, shopping, etc. For example, students use technology to serve for their learning like stuyding online or researching important things for their lessons. Lots of people also use it to play game, chat with their friends, or shopping online to relax after a hard-working day.

With technology, we can find and do almost things we need so we can save our times and will have more times to do the other activities like spending time with family, or hanging out with friends.

Second, technology helps us adpot hot problems, new informations of society faster and easier. We can read news on the websites, or watch the agenda to update more things everyday so we can have better knowlegde about things around us. Besides, many poor people have been helped by the others because the news about them have been shared wide-spread. This showed the major of technology and the care of people give to the others.

Many people said the use of technology has the limitation of human contact, and it's not all right. We can easily contact to the others by texting, calling as technology is developing . Using technology in general and social media in particular also can help us make friends. People often use Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to add friends over the world and follow them. It is a best way to know our friends, family members' activities without asking because we don't have too much time to speak with them everyday. Otherwises, we still have to speak face to face to the others as much as possible so we can understand them better, and it also shows our care to them.

Not only technology, everything in the world also has both positive and negative sides, and the main idea is ourselves. If we use technology for the right purposes, and can limit the time of using it, technology will be very useful to our lives. In short, technology can limit human contact or not based on us so let's try using it as limited as we can and don't forget to use it right ways, right times, and right purposes.",0
"The past century has seen a dramatic increase in the number of cars on the road. In 1900, there were only a few thousand cars in the United States. By 2000, there were over 200 million. However, the next twenty years are likely to see a decrease in the number of cars in use. There are several reasons for this.

The first reason is that cars are becoming increasingly expensive. The average price of a new car has risen from $20,000 in 2000 to $30,000 in 2020. This trend is likely to continue, as new technologies and safety features add to the cost of cars. As prices rise, fewer people will be able to afford to buy a car.

Second, the number of people living in urban areas is increasing. In 2000, about 60% of the world's population lived in cities. By 2030, that number is expected to rise to 70%. As more people move to cities, they will have less need for a car. Public transportation, walking, and biking will be more practical ways to get around.

Third, self-driving cars are becoming more common. In 2020, there are already several companies that are testing self-driving cars. These cars are likely to become more widespread in the next twenty years, as they become more affordable and reliable. Self-driving cars will reduce the need for people to own their own car, as they will be able to hail a self-driving car when they need one.

In summary, there are several reasons why the number of cars in use is likely to decrease in the next twenty years. Cars are becoming more expensive, more people are living in cities, and self-driving cars are becoming more common. This trend is likely to have a positive impact on the environment and on public health.",1
"In recent years, veganism has been gaining popularity in the United States. This dietary lifestyle choice, which involves abstaining from consuming animal products such as meat and dairy, is based on ethical considerations of reducing animal suffering and environmental impact. As more people become aware of these issues associated with eating a traditional Western diet, they are increasingly turning to veganism as an alternative way to live. While there are several advantages to this lifestyle change—including better health through improved nutrition and reduced risk of disease—there are a few drawbacks that would-be vegans should know before they commit to their new way of life. One significant downside to following a vegan diet is the potential for nutrient deficiencies if food choices aren’t balanced correctly. For instance, certain essential vitamins like B12 aren’t found naturally in plant-based foods so vegans must take supplements or fortified foods in order to get enough of them into their diets. Additionally, some types of protein sources such as nuts and beans can be difficult for individuals with compromised digestive systems or other medical conditions to digest properly; therefore it’s important for those who want try out veganism to consult with a doctor prior making any drastic changes in order ensure proper nutrition throughout the transition period. Another thing that potential vegans should consider is cost. A strict vegetarian or even fully plant-based diet may require more expensive ingredients than what omnivores typically eat since faux meats and cheeses (made from things like soybeans) tend to cost greater than animal proteins like chicken breasts or ground beef do pound per pound at most grocery stores today. Furthermore, processed convenience food items catering specifically towards vegetarians/vegans often come at premium pricepoints meaning those who opt for them will likely pay more overall compared someone eating mostly whole unprocessed foods not targeted toward one particular group over another which tend have cheaper prices across all markets due lower overhead costs production wise (e.g., materials needed manufacture). .",1
"Education is an investment in the future. Every day, school teachers help to shape the minds of the next generation of citizens, and the quality of teaching they provide has a great influence on the future of our society. That’s why it’s important that teachers receive proper compensation for their work.

However, some educators believe that teachers of different disciplines should be paid different wages, depending on how much those particular fields are valued in the outside world. This means that teachers in mathematics and science, for instance, would be paid more than teachers in the arts. I strongly disagree with this idea.

The reason for my disagreement lies in the fact that schools are not businesses, and should not be run like one. In the world of business, there are market forces which dictate the value of certain products or services. That’s why, for example, a software engineer may be paid more than a retail worker. But in the world of education, such market forces don’t exist. Different disciplines are valued not based on their monetary value, but rather on their importance to the development of our society.

The same can be said for teachers of different disciplines. Whether a teacher is teaching mathematics, science, or the arts, they are still providing a valuable service to their students and to society as a whole. To base their wages on what those same services may fetch on the open market would be unfair and potentially damaging to the quality of education in our schools.

Instead, I believe that all teachers, regardless of discipline, should be paid equally. This is not to say that there should not be any differences in wages at all. Teachers with more experience and qualifications should certainly be rewarded for their added expertise. But the fundamental bases for wages should be the same across all disciplines.

What’s more, paying all teachers the same amount could actually help to incentivize teachers to pursue further education in different disciplines. This could create a more balanced and well-rounded educational environment, and would ensure that our schools are providing the highest quality education possible.

In conclusion, I believe that teachers should be paid equally, regardless of the discipline they teach. This would ensure that all teachers are fairly compensated for their work, and would help to create a better educational environment for our students.",1
"When it comei to automobilei they can provide ui with numeroui benefiti. However, it would appear that limiting car uie hai far more advantagei than thought of before: it can help the environment, provide eaiier meani of commuting, and it can cut down on traffic congeition.

To begin, it would appear ai though that limited car uiage ii a environment iaving technique. For initance, within the article In German Suburb, Life Goei On Without Cari by Eliiabeth Roienthal, it itatei of the exiitence of a imall iuburban city namei Vauban, Germany that hai nearly obiolete the uie of automobilei. Within the fifth paragraph of the article they talk of why it ii io neceiiary for thii to become a trend,Automobilei are the linchpin of iuburbi... And that, experti iay, ii a huge impediment to current efforti to draitically reduce greenhouie gai emiiiioni from tailpipe...paiienger cari are reiponiible for 12 percent of greenhouie gai emiiiioni in Europe.... Thii bit of information informi thoie that drive of the harmful effecti that our cari are creating upon the environment. However, if we are to limit our uiei of cari, and like the reiidenti of Vauban, and find alternative meani of traniportation then maybe we can reduce the amount of greenhouie gaiei that are being given off by cari. Similarly, Parii hai taken up a iimilar idea. In Robert Dufferi article, Parii bani driving due to imog he talki of the percautioni that France hai taken to driving and why. Parii hai created a ban io that thoie who have a liicenie plate that begini with an even number cannot drive on a certain day, and the next day thoie who have a liicenie plate that itarti with an odd number cannot drive. Thii all began becauie, ...after fivedayi of inteniifying imog... The imog rivaled Beijing, China, which ii known ai one of the moit polluted citiei in the world.paragraph 14. Pariii efforti to create leii imog wai a iucceii and they now implement the ban on Mondayi and Tueidayi. Due to leii driveri, they were even able to reduce the amount of imog polluting the air. Limited and reitrictive uiage on cari ieemi to be very helpful when iaving the environment.

Next, the near obiolete uie of cari hai made for eaiier modei of traniportation. For example, in Eliiabeth Roienthali paiiage  In German Suburb, Life Goei On Without Cari ihe telli of the many benifiti that limited car uie have upon their community. In paragraph iix ihe itatei that iuburbi are beginning to be,...more compact and more acceiiible to public traniportation, with leii ipace for parking. In thii new approach, itorei are placed a walk away, on a main itreet, rather than in malli along iome diitant highway. Thii meaning that there will be more of an eaie when traveling and everything being cloier together. No longer will people have to drive milei away for iome groceriei, they will iimply either walk or ride the bui to their deitination. They will no longer be itreiied ai to what time they have left to reach a itore that ii a diitance away. Along the iame linei, ioemtimei it can be eaiier to not drive at all. In the article The End of Car Culture the author, Eliiabeth Roienthal, itatei how many people have found diffrent meani of getting to where they are going. In paragraph thirtyieven ihe iayi, New Yorki new bikeiharing program and iti ikyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolli reflect thoie new prioritiei.... From the information given, it appeari ai though finding eaiier meani of traniportation have become a new popular trend. Since pricei to travel by car are ioaring, the cheapier iolution appeari to juit be walking, or ai itated, riding a bike. Leading people to belive that the near extinction of car uiage hai left ui with eaiier meani of travel.

Laitly, chooiing to not uie cari more frequently hai left ui with leii traffic. In Andrew Selikyi Carfree day ii ipinning into a big hit in Bogota he talki about the reaioing for thii. ...millioni of Columbiani hiked, biked, ikated or took buiei to work during a carfree day yeiterday, leaving the itreeti of thii capital city eerily devoid of traffic jami.paragraph 20. Due to the environmentaly iafe meani of travel, traffic hai become a thing of the pait. Thii can alio mean for the reiidenti, a faiter, iafer way of traveling if they take a taxi or bui to their deitination. Even Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company had input to thii. Eliiabeth Roienthal wai able to incorporate a itatement into her article The End of Car Culture when on the iubject of the decline in car uiage. Mr. Ford had to iay that, ...pedeitrian, bicycle, private cari, commercial and public traniportation traffic are woven into a connected network to iave time, conierve reiourcei, lower emiiiioni and improve iafety. paragraph 43. Thii itatement can inform the general population that from the drop in cari on the road, it can improve our iafety and iave time becauie of the fewer motoriit on the road. That traffic ii nearing an end which can be a new age in which traffic ii gone. Which ii why, when people chooie not to uie cari it can help to reduce traffic.

In concluiion, when it comei to automobilei they can provide ui with numeroui benefiti. However, it would appear that limiting car uie hai far more advantagei than thought of before: it can help the environment, provide eaiier meani of traveling, and it can reduce traffic.",0

"In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile' the author is telling us about the FACS

which stands for facial action coding system that can identify human emotions. This technology will be valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. Teachers and students would be able to use this amazing technology in which ever way needed.

The FACS technology is an amazing way to determine the emotions of people by reading their muscles of the face or the way ones mouth is moved. In paragraph 6 the author tells us if the student becomes confused about a lesson on the computer, then the computer could read facial expressions then later on modify the lesson so that it becomes more interesting to the student or whoever maybe working on the assignment. This piece of technology would be helpful in my school or in any school because if the students are working on a assignment or test and they get confused maybe the computer could help the students out.

"The Electoral College vote is a somewhat a confusing process with the voter not voting for the president, but electors who elect the president. Many people think that this method is flawed becuase the people are not electing the president. On the hand people think that the Electoral vote keeps the race for presidency with a more clear outcome, than if they were elected by the popular vote. There are defiently two different arguments to this points with both sides involving good evidence.

There are many flaws that people bring up in regard to the electoral vote. One of these is that since the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, the electors could easily defy the will of the people. The most obvious fact about the electoral vote is that you are not voting for the president, but for a group of electors who then vote for the president. This is also unfair to voters because the candidates don't spend time in states they know will not win. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not even see the candidates, and people in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. In turn the elctoral college is unfair and outdated.

Though there are plently of things wrong with the electoral college there are still plently of good arguments as to why we should keep it.  With the electoral college vote there is less of a chance of a dispute over the outcome thaan with the popular vote, though it happened in the 2000 election. The electoral can also make the race more fair, because a candidate with more regional appeal can not gain more electoral votes by campaigning heavily in that area. The electoral college also can help avoid run-off elections like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. Overally the Electoral College vote is a way of electing a president without actually electing a president, that should probabley be removed so the people have more of a say on who runs there country.",0

"No matter how big or small it is, every city has something special to offer its residents and visitors. For me, the most captivating aspect of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is its rich history. The City of Brotherly Love has a long and storied past that dates back over three hundred years and includes significant contributions to our nation’s development in many different areas. Philadelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn as part of the Pennsylvania colony, which grew out of a land grant from King Charles II.Penn envisioned Philadelphia as an ideal city based on his Quaker principles which included religious tolerance – something that would be very rare during this time period all over the world – but especially in America, where freedom for people of all faiths were nonexistent almost everywhere else. From then until now, Philadelphia had played a major role in American history; some notable moments include being home to both the signing of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution at Independence Hall , serving as temporary capital for a brief period between 1790-1800 when Congress met there , housing one of first public libraries (established 1731), plus hosting two World Fairs - 1876 Centennial Exposition & 1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition . . Not only did these events make Philly famous throughout history books across America but they also sparked immense growth within the city itself: new industries arose such as cotton mills/textiles (which helped usher in industrial revolution) while also creating hundreds upon hundreds jobs for immigrants who flooded into PHL shortly before + during 1900s – making this population boom possible due to abundant job opportunities available here during those times . . Today we can still see remnants from those eras around us like Betsy Ross house , Franklin Square Park & Liberty Bell Pavilion - making it clear why so many tourists flock here year after year just get glimpse what once was! You don't even need leave your own neighborhood explore plenty historical sites without breaking bank either thanks many “tours” or",1
"Everyone would eventually ask an advice if they need help on a particular subject or ask for an opinion if they ever get confuse. Advises or opinions would solve one's problem. For example, to prevent making poor choices or decisions, to determine which advice is accurate, and to allow someone to feel secure with choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.

Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. For instant, if someone gets confuse. If you're lost on one subject. Also, if someone gets lonely. if someone doesn't have a baseball team. Lastly, if someone gets worried or afraid. If someone you know is absent or gone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

In summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. I believe that asking yourself for advice is also necessary. but, viewing many opinions from people is probably more necessary than viewing your own advice.",0
"The four-day school week has grown in popularity as an alternative to the typical five day school week. But what are the pros and cons of this new system? Research shows a potential for savings in energy and resources due to greater flexibility in managing the school calendar and the ability to reduce operational costs. But there are also potential drawbacks to consider. Students may find it difficult to adjust to an extended school day, teachers may feel overwhelmed by the longer teaching load, and the quality of education could be adversely impacted due to the lack of a traditional five-day week.

Further research into the effectiveness of the four-day school week is necessary in order to determine whether or not this system is a viable alternative to the traditional five-day school week. Several school systems have implemented this new system with both success and failure. For example, in the Wake County, North Carolina school system, students and staff reported greater job satisfaction and improved attendance. Conversely, in Arizona, the four-day school week had a significant negative impact on student performance and academic achievement.

When compared to the traditional five-day school week, the four-day week appears to have both environmental and economic benefits; however, caution must be taken to ensure that the quality of education is not sacrificed. It is important to consider the effect that the longer school day will have on students and teachers alike, and to ensure that the resources are available to maintain an adequate learning environment and to accommodate the longer school days. Ultimately, only when the potential benefits and drawbacks are considered in depth can a conclusion be drawn as to whether or not implementing a four-day school week for conserving energy and resources is a viable option.",1
"High school is like a preschool for young adults, where they get a chance to explore the world much earlier.

Students at grade nine through twelve get to learn what they want to be at a young age. It gets them more interested in the careers they choose in the nearest future. As they get through high school, they will know what path to take and what needs to get done. As soon as these young adults leave they won't have to stress of what their going to be. It's agreeable for students to start looking into their career at a young age.

Through out the years in High school, students will have the rights to choose their own courses, which follows up to their interest. For example: culinary arts, design multi media, masonry, and more. They can also choose any subjects such as: math, English, science, and history. These courses can also help those students with their future careers. While these students are learning they realize what they like and what they don't like. The upcoming goal for them by the time they leave high school is what they are going to become.

As these young adults think of what their going to be, they will think twice on some careers. Which gives them time to research options, and that research will reflect on which career is the best for them. While being young an thinking of a career students will have enough time to sort the ones the students like and the ones they dislike. The average life Span of a human is up to 75 years, which means 18 of those years can resolve of what the students are going to do when they grow up. Teen's can dream what they could be but can they put the effort in trying.

As in college, students will have to get credits to graduate high school, and need to pass a amount of exams.

From there the students path will flow to what college they'll go, when thinking young they got to think smart, which means they got to put the effort. When thinking of a career at a young age the students will have most of everything planned. Its never too much to notice that a student has more potential young than old because they got more time.

The students won't stress out because their not out in the world alone finding what to do.

Teens can commit to any career because they have had a whole lot of time to think of any career.

Its never bad for a kid to have dreams of being a cop and going for that career. Its always good to plan ahead, to always think and do. It's great that a young adult wants to think of it's future. Agreeing something that everybody has done, is something that people can agree on.",0
"Every person has a different way of thinking, If people listened to one person's opinion or advice, they would all have limited ways of thinking about the problem. Seeking more than one opinion can help someone make better choice because they could choose the best opinion, not have a limited way of thinking, and help make progress.

Seeking multiple opinion can help someone make a better choice because they could choose the best opinion. When people do a group project, they get everyone's opinion. This helps to choose the best opinion that fits in the topic. When I had to make a small car for a school project, I asked my parents and friends to get multiple opinions. It helped me find the best material to make the car out of and designs of the car. Multiple opinions could help people to find the best opinion that fits in the topic.

Getting multiple opinions can help not having a limited way of thinking. If every people got advice from one person, they would all have same aspects. Even if the person was wrong, they would all think they got the right opinion because they only listened to one person and never had a chance to get a opinion from people who has other aspects on the problem. When I ask people for opinion about a certain problem, it helps me have thoughts on every aspect. I could know people's reason why they agree to the solution about the problem and people's reason why they disagree the solution. Then it helps me choose the more reasonable side of the solution.

Getting multiple opinion also helps make progress. For example, if a company is making a new phone for the elders, they could ask the elders to use their new product and hear what is a good option or a good option to add and what is a option that they don't need. When I made a small car, I asked my parents to see it and tell me things that I have to fix or add more. After hearing all the opinions I made changes to make the car look better.

Seeking more than one opinion can help someone make better choice because they could choose the best opinion, not have a limited way of thinking, and help make progress. They could choose the best opinion by listening to every options. They would not have a limited way of thinking because they can listen to every aspects. They could make progress by getting multiple advises. Hearing multiple opinions could help people in these ways.",0
"In both the Roman and Islamic Empires, collaboration was highly valued as a way of pooling resources and perspectives to achieve common goals. Collaboration typically involved two or more individuals or groups working together to obtain a desired outcome from a project. The collaborative approach allowed for different perspectives and ideas to be combined to create more effective solutions. 

For example, when creating a new infrastructure project within the Roman Empire, it was not uncommon for a variety of experts to be consulted. The multi-faceted approach, which included individuals with different expertise, allowed for all angles to be identified and addressed to ensure the end result was a project that was feasible and beneficial to the Empire. Similarly, in the Islamic Empire, collaboration was seen as an important part of the decision-making process and ideas were welcomed from different stakeholders for input.

Combining different ideas and perspectives when seeking advice or trying to solve a problem is a key advantage of collaboration. By gathering input from multiple people, there is greater potential for a better solution to be identified and for the efficiency of the project to be improved. However, it is also important to understand the information and advice that is being provided before attempting to create a solution. In both Empires, it was viewed as essential to truly understand the opinion and contributions of all parties involved in order to create a favorable outcome.",1
"People ask for advice on a daily basis, But is asking more then one person to much advice. You need more then one persons advice for different things and everybody has an opinion on different things so you should as multiple people for any advice you need. There can be people who agree with you and who dont agree with you so its always good to know both sides of the story.

Lets say you want a new pet so you ask 5 of your friends what you should get between a puppy and a grown dog, You might want a puppy but not all your friends might agree with you,3 out of 5 friends say you should get a puppy because it is energetic and you can see it grow and it will be loyal to you because it has been your puppy for along time,2 out of 5 friends say you should get a grown up dog because it will be trained and it will not pee in your house as much as puppies do,both sides of your friends gave very good advice so now you can think about what you really want.

Getting advice from more then one person like you mom and from your dad you can ask them how a dress looks on you,your mom will know what to look at like how your body looks in it how it fits you all these things but you dad on the other hand wont say as much as your mom he might just say it looks nice without really looking at every little detail on your dress.

Getting more then one opnion isnt as bad as some people might think its very helpful if you dont know what to do or think at some giving point its alright you never know what you might hear or find out so it all works out in the end game.",0
"My opinion about If school students have to a four-day school week. The students and teachers can get more a free dar, that day we can take sleep, study for other you need study someting, enjoy with your family, develop your self and what do I want to do. I can have many good someting for you. But the other days, you have the school day two more hours. You need think about now. We have seven hour on school, you dose not tired for long times in school? The seven hour is very long time,

every early morning all students wake up the may de am 5:30 or 6:00, you need take prepare to go to school, and stay there for seven hour. But if we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours, you should loss the two hours from many something. For example, I can't have a sleep, study for you need know someting, enjoy with my family, develop my self, and what do I want to do. Because of we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours. If we have two more hour in school, we need stay two more hour in school, more study.

"The Evolution of Social Media: A Look at How it has Changed the Way We Communicate. In the beginning, there were no social media platforms. Our only way to communicate was through face-to-face conversations or written letters. Fast forward to today, and we have a plethora of social networks available for us to use - from Facebook and Instagram, to Snapchat and TikTok. But what impact has this had on our lives? How has social media changed the way we interact with one another? This essay will explore how advances in technology have drastically altered communication over the past decade or so due to the emergence of popular social networks. Most notably, people are now able to connect with far more individuals than ever before. It used be that if you wanted to keep up with someone's life events you would need their address or phone number; but now it's as simple as sending them a friend request online (or following them) and getting access into their updates instantly! Not just that — many of these sites also allow users to filter who they want updates from based on interests, location, age group etc., making it easier than ever for people all around the world share commonalities and form relationships even if they live thousands of miles apart. Furthermore, features such as video calling make it possible for users not only hear each other’s voices but see facial expressions — creating an authentic experience despite geographical distance that was never possible prior. . Moreover, messaging apps like WhatsApp provide an instantaneous line of communication without any long wait times associated with traditional mail systems or landlines; lending itself well towards conversing casually throughout day-to-day activities rather than strictly reserved for formal occasions like phone calls are usually saved for nowadays. Moreover texting allows users save conversations so they can go back days later and refer back whenever needed which is very convenient compared writing down everything in physical notebooks/diaries - given its ease of access & portability since most phones fit comfortably in",1
"You should always seek out for new Idea's and opinions. Did you know that half of the top businesses in the world were not from the idea of the owner. It came from people with ideas and newly opened up opinions.

When someone gives you an idea for a business there basically trying to help you invest in money or help you gain money for the better if the buisnes and the owner himself. Let's say a construction worker is about to go and build a house or another type of building you need someones opinion or idea to make sure your doing it right so therefore people can by your builing. People even need ideas or opinions when it comes to eating at a resteraunt, your not going to eat nasty food are you?

When people ask for advice the are asking for your opinion or how feel to feel about the subject the person is talking about. When people bring up asubject about something you bring up more than one person because it was more then one persons Idea or opinion. Now that you cn see basically the whole world woudln't be what it is today if it weren't for idea's and opinions.

The are is never a bad Idea or opinion also every question that you ask is a good question. Things get built faster and even things get invented based off somobodys opinion. Whenever you feel as if you need to ask a question go ahead and ask the question because there is never a bad question to ask because you might be on the verge of creating something new and just don't know it yet.

Lots of eventers createed a lot things based on there opinion on something. Thomas Edison belived that he could make a ball of light and what did he do he mad the light bulb and every single house in the world that uses electricity uses the light bulb,I even got one at my house. Bengimin Franklin wanted to find out what lightning was so he went outside with a kite and a and a key and he captured and it couldv'e killed him. But it did not instead of dieing he was the creater of elctrictity. How do you think you got to work today? Even public speakers have there own opinions how do you think African American children and American children are in the same school,becasue Martin Luther King Jr belived or felt as if that the shouldn't be segregated any longer. The thing is about that is that is was his opion and helt to need he needed to say what he thought to everybody now lookat the world.

Now that you have seen all of the evidence, you know that opinions matter no matter hiw stupid you may think it is. You could be on the verge to something beyond great or even an inventer. Just know you opinion matters know matter what!",0
"My dream is to become a professional engineer and make a positive impact in the world. It is important to me because I want to create sustainable solutions that will make people's lives better and help solve some of the world's most pressing problems. To achieve my dream, I'm planning to dedicate myself to academic excellence, gaining experience in research and internships, and building my professional network. 

To gain insight into what it takes to achieve my dream, I have studied different stories of successful individuals. From looking at their stories, I have learned the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. Taking a closer look at their paths, I have noticed the importance of the right mentors and team members. While some people may choose to work alone, a team can provide invaluable guidance, support, and help make your dreams a reality. 

At the same time, I understand that it is important to take time to relax and trust myself. Some of the most successful people don't just rely on an external team to achieve their goals; they learn to trust in their own abilities and make decisions based on their own understanding. Taking time to relax and reflect helps me gain valuable insight that is required when making decisions. It allows me to think through different scenarios and evaluate different outcomes. Overall, giving myself the time to trust in my own decision-making process is critical in order to reach my goal.",1
"After releasing the photographs about a mesa on Mars or now known as the Face of Mars, theories have come up claiming that it is in fact a face of an old extraterrestial. This is completely false claim that has no evidence or support to be supported with. This mesa is a common natural landform that can be found commonly around. This is a mesa that happens to look like a face. Although it can look pretty convincing and decieving, it's something common. Like mountains on Earth, it's something that triggers your brain claiming it to be something it isn't. It's like seeing a shadow pass by the corner of your eye! You claim you saw it, but it was just a fragment of your imagination. It's something our brains trigger.

As it states in the article, praragraph two and three, it states that the face the public saw was just an illusion forming eyes, a mouth, and a nose. There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This sentence supports the claim that the face was a simple fargemnt of the brain creating an illusion of something. It's a common landform that naturally is created. Although many theorist's claim that it had to do something with aliens and extraterrestrials, there is no evidence to support or back up that claim. Where else have you seen something out of the normal on Mars? Where there any prints or traces leading to something else? People just need to understand that it's was a landform and a landform only. In paragraph three, it supports the claim that the face was a natural landform. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation. . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.' The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. Not only did the face gain notorious fame, but the story got a lot of publicity and gained a lot more attention than it should have. All the face was was an illusion that the brain of many created. Although many knew it was a natural landform, many supporting those scientists wanted the outcome of the story to take a COMPLETELY different turn! Many wanted the face to be the result of an ancient civilization on Mars, which also couldn't be possible. There were a lot of crazy theories and rumors, but the truth was the one that people denied to believe in.

This story took many turns, twists, accusations, false claims, and more incredible stuff made up by the public. Although it was a simple landform, many denied that to the core, and many defended that statement with their live's. The simple truth of this whole mess, is that it was a photograph taken of a natural landform near Cydonia, that was mistaken as a face with eyes, nose, and mouth by the illusions of many theorists or confused and intruiged viewers. To think the public thought a landform would be a face.",0
"People make hard choices every day, and sometimes they don't know what to do. Advice from other people can be helpful to you in so many different ways. Such as, other people have personal experience that you might not have, sometimes you dont know what to do and other people can tell, and having input from a lot of people can give you options on what to do.

Other people having personal experience that you dont have can be helpful. They can give you suggestions on what to do. People say that experience is the best teacher. If that is the case then wouldn't it make sense to take advice from other people, that have personal experience that you dont have.

Sometimes you dont know what to do, and your just confused. Other people can sometimes understand the situation better than you can, and help you though it. Because sometimes you dont have all the answers. Other people can also be more calm than you in certain situations, and therefor make the better choice.

Having input from a lot of people can be very helpful in many situations. They can also give you choices on what to do in hard situations. Sometimes you dont know what to do and other people can make the choice for you taking off a lot of stress.

Taking advice from other people can be helpful, it can give you more options, other people can have personal experience that you dont have, and sometimes you dont know what to do and others can make the choice for you.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more sustainable and efficient communities. As exemplified in Vauban, Germany, where a car-free community has been established, limiting car usage can lead to happier and more relaxed residents. Additionally, car-free suburbs have been gaining traction around the world, as planners realize the need to create compact, accessible communities with less space dedicated to parking. By adopting this approach, we can promote alternative transportation options, increase public transportation usage, and create a healthier and more sustainable future.

One of the main reasons for limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can go up to 50 percent. By decreasing our reliance on cars and promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of pollution caused by car emissions. After the ban was implemented, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels dropped. Similarly, in the Colombian capital of Bogota, a car-free day was introduced to reduce smog and promote alternative modes of transportation such as biking and taking the bus. The success of these initiatives highlights the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on air quality.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and efficient communities. In the car-free community of Vauban, residents have embraced a low-car suburban life, with 70 percent of families not owning cars. Stores and amenities are placed within walking distance, promoting a more active and healthy lifestyle. This approach to urban planning is being adopted around the world, as cities recognize the need to move away from car-centric development and create more compact and accessible communities that prioritize pedestrians and public transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more sustainable and efficient communities. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the success of limiting car usage initiatives and the positive impact they can have. It is essential for individuals and policymakers to prioritize alternative transportation methods and embrace a more car-free lifestyle in order to create a healthier and more sustainable future.",1

"The so called face on Mars is clearly just a natural landform.

If it was a face, then why would it be the only one we see.

If this was a face, would it have been the only living being on Mars.

If it were a face, it does clearly resemble that of a human, but no human has been to Mars.

You could say maybe humans began civilization on Mars but we had to leave for whatever reason and when we got to Earth we suddenly went into a stone age, and that face was from a human that died on Mars, but that would have to have been millions of years ago and the face would no doubt have been buried in the sand.

If you are not yet convinced that this is just and landform that coincidentally looks like a face yet, then here are some more arguments.

In paragraph 7, it talks about how they took a much better quality photo of the face and it appeared to be nothing more than a landform.

You could also argue that maybe the sand covered up the facial features, but why wouldn't it have done that a long time ago?

Wouldn't that mean that whatever kind of species it was died recently?

If so why don't we see millions or thousands or hundreds or even tens of this species?

Was it the only one ever to exist on the planet.

If it Mars were sustainable for this creature, then it would clearly be sustainable enough for more creatures to appear just like it.

Also NASA scientists are no doubt more qualified then any average citizen when it comes to topics about other planets, and even they appear to think that it is just a landform.

If it was a face, this would prove that there was life on Mars which could benefit NASA, so they ultimately would have no reason to keep it from us.

This face is just a landform but people seem to think that it proves that there was life on Mars.

While there may have been life on Mars, I don't think that this landform proves it.",0
"The Power of Music as a Form of Social Activism. Throughout history, music has been used as an effective form of social activism. It has historically played an integral role in communicating messages and inspiring change in society by bringing people together to raise awareness about difficult topics or injustices — from civil rights movements to anti-war protest songs. From the chants sung on picket lines to modern hip-hop, music is one powerful tool that can empower individuals and unite them behind a common cause. Music offers a unique platform for artists and activists alike: it allows for creativity, self-expression, and vulnerability while creating community through shared experiences. Protest songs have long been used as rallying cries for collective action: from Bob Dylan's Blowin' In The Wind against war and racial inequality during the Civil Rights Movement; to Gil Scott Heron's The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, which speaks out against commercialization and consumerism; Bruce Springsteen's Born In The USA, which calls attention to veterans' rights; John Lennon's Give Peace A Chance, advocating pacifism around the world; Pussy Riot's revolutionary punk rock anthem protesting Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian rule in Russia. All these examples demonstrate how music can be utilized to reflect society’s political struggles while empowering people with ideas of hope, progress, liberation—and ultimately inner strength required for social change. . Of course every culture has their own distinct repertoire of protest songs but what remains universal is that when we come together through song—whether communal singing or silent listening—we feel empowered because our voices are being heard both literally (through lyrics) and figuratively (by uniting with others). This creates an atmosphere where marginalized communities are not only seen but also actively engaged in meaningful dialogue about pertinent issues: people coming from all walks of life standing shoulder-to-shoulder united under one banner shouting out their grievances loudly enough for everyone else in hearing range",1
"Dear Senator, The process of voting through the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers. While some say that the Electoral College goes against America's democratic ideals and it increases the probability for a disastrous vote, the Electoral College still gives american citizens some sway in the election and with a completely democratic system of voting there is a good chance that the outcome could be even more disastrous. The Electoral college is a compromise of voting between citizens and the government, it represents the people as evenly as it can, and it still gives voters a collective chance to change the outcome of an election.

One reason that the Electoral college works so well is that it is not completely run by the people or run by the government. Rather both are part of the voting process, having equal representation. While democracy is highly regarded in America, it would be unwise to have a vote completely run by the people. The government needs to have some system in place that gives citizens a vote, but not complete free reign. If the people of America voted and the election outcome was disastrous, then the government needs to have a scapegoat in place. The founding fathers understood this which is why the Electoral College is still in place today.

The Electoral College does not give a single voter a chance to sway an election, however America's population as a whole is represented. Not one region or state has enough electoral votes to elect a president Par 19 and 21. This is a good thing because candidates pay equal attention to all of America's people. Also, in the Electoral College, not every state has the same amount of electoral votes because every state has a different population size. This might seem like unequal representation of that states, but the election is not meant to give each state an equalized vote, it is meant to give the population of america an even representation.

Swing states give America's people a chance to decide an elections outcome. In swing states the voters are very thoughtful about their candidates because they know that in the their case, that their vote really does count par 20. It is good to have voters who are very thoughtful and cautious about their vote. The Electoral Colleges encourages this type of behavior among citizens by giving voters a chance to sway an election in swing states. Swing states can impact an election. They are an example of how the Electoral College, while still not completely democratic, still gives the people a vote.

Through the Electoral College America's population is represented, the government and it's citizens have equal representation, and American people can still impact the outcome of an election. The founding fathers of America thought of this while they created the foundation that our country proudly stands on. The Electoral College should stay as it is. It still works effectively to decide on who will become president. As long as the College works effectively, then ther should be no issue with it.",0
"As technology advances and the world becomes more interconnected, it is becoming increasingly important to understand different cultures. Intercultural communication can help bridge differences between people from different backgrounds and create understanding among them. It is essential in today's globalized society for individuals to be aware of cultural nuances and how they can affect interactions with others. Intercultural communication involves exchanging messages that are tailored to each party’s culture, beliefs, values, customs, language, norms, or behaviors. Through intercultural exchanges we gain an appreciation for one another’s beliefs rather than just tolerating them as foreign concepts. This helps create a positive atmosphere when interacting with people who have differing perspectives on life and encourages respect towards each other. Furthermore, it promotes trust which enables us to communicate openly without fear of judgement or misunderstanding due to cultural barriers. In order to successfully engage in intercultural dialogue there must be an open mind and willingness to learn about one another's culture while also respecting its uniqueness. The first step is often listening carefully during conversations; this allows us to better comprehend what is being said so that our response is appropriate given the context of the conversation at hand. Additionally making sure not every interaction centers around differences but instead shifts focus onto commonalities will allow for more meaningful conversations through mutual understanding of goals or interests shared by both parties involved in the exchange . . Furthermore engaging in activities like travelling abroad or joining student organizations or clubs focused on international affairs provides diverse opportunities for face-to-face encounters that could then lead into further discussion on a variety of topics ranging from leisurely activities all the way up serious matters such as politics . Doing research before engaging in any form of communication about a particular topic also helps give insight into various views regarding said subject matter thus preventing potential offence caused by unfamiliarity with certain customs/traditions held sacred by certain groups within society . Ultimately successful intercultural communication relies upon mutual trust based off reciprocal respect thus allowing productive dialogue centered",1
"The works of a car have created wonders to people as early as the early 1900s. Now people need to understand the advatages of limting car use. Pollution has gone down in cities from not using cars and people have reported less stress, which is due to the car rates going down. Many people have argued that jobs are going to go more down then we may need, if we stop using cars, but there is always a way to fix small situations such as that.

Studies have shown cars have created pollution for the enviornment. Pollution can cause sickness and other affects that can cause a habitat to be inhabitable.Pasenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States,(Rosenthal,5). Though, we can fix that. Many cities such as Paris,France have experimented with the law involving cars to see if the country can have a pollution decrease and they did, within the first day. Duffer reported that on Monday Paris created a ban for the even-numbered plates and the smog was able to clear in one day's time. The smog cleared enough Monay for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday, (Duffer,19).

People have argued that stopping car production may cause people to lose their jobs. There is a way to fix that. Selsky reported that in Bogota,Colombia because of the car distribution slowing down they were able to make parks and sport centers accessiable. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city,(Selsky,28). With that being said without people running any of those faclities then parks and sport centers wouldn't be that accessiable to the fellow citizens. So by creating more places like parks and sport centers, and less places like car factories we would be able to limit car usage without the worry of someone losing their job and not being able to get one.

Cars have also been known to cause stress. In the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Rosaenthal quoted Heidrun Walter talking about how tense she was when she had a car. The constant worrying for gas and car bills may be a factor towards the stress in someone's life. Young adults have not worried as much for a car, making the somewhat more content. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy, (Rosenthal,39).

Limting car use can cause a major impact on today's society. Demographic shifts in driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate, (Rosenthal,38). It has many advantages that people should understand. Pollution rates can go down. Stress could go down once you start limting car use.",0

"Cell Phones and Driving

In today's society, the world depends on technology for nearly everything. It's used to communicate, do research, play games and even to give us directions when we are driving and lost. Everywhere you look you are likely to see technology in use, with one of the most popular devices being cellphones. This is easy to explain, as stated above, they are used for communication, access to internet, games and more. However, there are some instances when cell phones are a threat to our safety. Though cell phones are useful in some capacity, in most scenarios people should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving.

To begin, one of the main issues with cell phones like many other technology devices, cell phones are a distraction when you need to focus on the environment around you. While driving, the most important rule is to be completely attentive to your environment. Others may argue that people are able to multitask and can still focus on the road while using a phone.

Though this may have some truth, the problem comes when the cell phone distracts your attention from something that has happened on the road and/ or affects your reaction time. For example, image you are driving while texting a friend and you look up and notice a car swerving into your lane. With only one hand on the will you try to move over to avoid the car, but without full control of the wheel you end up turning too far and crashing into the another car. Even if you were able to drop your phone and put both hands on the wheel, by that time the car has already crashed into you. In this situation, an accident could have been avoided if you had been paying attention and acted quickly before the car came to close. Driving is already dangerous enough as something could go wrong in a matter of seconds, using a cell phone at the same time would only make it even more difficult in most cases.

In addition, despite popular beliefs, most people don't do well when trying to multitask. For driving, this means that if you are on your phone you are paying attention to the phone and not the road, even if it is just for a few seconds. But what could happen in a few seconds, some may ask? For example, you are driving to a friend's house through a populated neighborhood. You see that the street is all clear and take this chance to text your friend and tell them that you are close. At that exact moment at child runs into the street chasing a ball they had been playing with. By the time you look up it is too late to stop and you end up hitting the child. This accident could have been avoided if you had been paying one-hundred percent attention to the road. Even in situations when the problem is not another driver or pedestrian, there are still many things you should be paying attention to on the road. For instance, image the same example as above except there is no child in the road. The street is clear and you pull out your phone to text. At that moment you notice a pothole and swerve to avoid it and end up running over the sidewalk and straight into a tree. Yet again, this accident could have been avoided if you had been focusing on the road.

Although in most situations, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving, there are two scenarios which when it may be need. The first situation is when the driver is lost and needs directions. In this situation, using the phone for directions is necessary, however this should be done in a certain way. When this is the situation the driver should use some type of hands free device to hold the phone so that they can keep both hands on the wheel at all times. The other scenario is in case of emergency. For example, you are driving on the highway and see a bad accident occur but you are unable to stop and do anything. In this situation it is appropriate to use your phone to call the police so that they can get there as soon as possible to help anyone who may have been injured in the accident. Outside of incidents such as these drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity.

To summarize, with the exception of being lost or in case of emergency, drivers should not be able to use cell phone while on the road as it not only puts themselves in danger, but those around them as well. In today's society, there have been countless accidents as a result of texting and driving. When you learn how to drive, the first thing you do is put on your seatbelt, why?

Because safety is the highest priority. If drivers are allowed to freely use their phones when on the road, that means that safety is no longer the highest priority and countless lives would be put at risk of injury and even death. If a text message, call, game or anything else is that important it will still be there for you to respond to after you have gotten to your destination safely.",0

Subject: The Electoral College vs. Election by Popular Vote

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is [Your Name], and I am a concerned citizen of [State]. I am writing to express my views on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and the possibility of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, including the texts What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, and In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner, I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College for the following reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Despite occasional disputes over the outcome, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system ensures a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes, minimizing the likelihood of protracted disputes. Although the popular vote winner may not always win the presidency, such instances have been scarce throughout history. The rarity of such occurrences suggests that the Electoral College generally reflects the will of the people and produces an undisputed outcome.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of everyone's president. In an era of increasing regionalism, it is essential that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College forces candidates to campaign beyond their solid regional bases and appeals to voters from different regions. This ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation and not just a few concentrated areas. By preventing candidates with only regional appeal from becoming presidents, this system promotes unity and a balanced representation of diverse perspectives.

Moreover, the focus on swing states in presidential campaigns, thanks to the winner-take-all method, ensures that voters in these states receive special attention. Swing states often play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of elections, leading to greater voter engagement and informed decision-making. By allocating campaign efforts to these states, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address issues that are important to swing state voters, resulting in a more thoughtful and well-informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed by the Constitution, grants small states more influence in the political process than their population would suggest. The Electoral College further amplifies this balance by providing larger states with more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This ensures that the concerns and interests of both small and large states are heard and considered in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College allows for clear winners and avoids the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections can significantly complicate the election process. The Electoral College, by design, leads to a clear winner who secures the majority of the electoral votes. This avoids the need for additional rounds of voting and ensures a swift, decisive outcome for the nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective and balanced system for electing the president of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes the concept of everyone's president, encourages voter engagement in swing states, restores balance between large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections. While concerns about fairness and representation are valid, the Electoral College continues to be a necessary compromise that merits preservation.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my views on this important matter. I trust that you will make an informed decision that upholds the best interests of our state and nation. I look forward to witnessing the positive outcomes that the Electoral College can continue to deliver in our democratic process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because,One,it can help the teachers keep track of what the emotions of their students are,Two,it could benefit not only a classroom,but a whole school to know what each student is feeling and what their reaction might be and,Three to see how students express how they feel about a certain thing in school without showing emotion on the outside of their faces,in other words to see what kind of bad emotions they hold on the inside, and prevent something bad from happening.

First this technology can be very useful for teachers to help their students out,by being able to see how their students are feeling. Sometimes students in schools don't get to much attention from teachers,but with the help of this technology,all teachers have to do maybe in the morning,when students arive to a classroom,check a computer that will help them know what their students are feeling. According to this article it states,a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored which means not only does the teacher have to look at a computer everyday,but if the teacher tells the students to each get on a computer,The teacher doesn't do anything because the computer will let them know.

Next,the benefit could be for schools with this new technology beacause it can help them keep track of students who maybe are not having a god day,or who are very excited and happy. Another benefit to the school is that they can put this technology in each of their classrooms and it works as if it was another proffessor in the class. In this article it also states,then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructure,which clarifies that this could be a help for teachers and that way schools wouldn't have to worry much about their students having issues with their emotions or tough days they have.

Finally, this technology can also help teachers and staff, not only see the emotions students have on the outside,but on the inside. Students will never tell a teacher when they are feeling very mad or angry or what actions they want to take,therefore if a teacher notices those expressions on a students face, they will know how to deal with their situation. In the text it also states,most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,which means this technology can read what emotion a student might be feeling inside.

This new technology can be very useful in schools and in classrooms, so I would say that since it can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom,its very valuable. These were some of the reasons why this new technology can be very valuable and very helpfull as well so this technology has a big impact for a classroom with students in it who have emotional expressions.",0
"Have you ever asked multiple peope the same question? The chances are you have, this is becuase asking multiple poeple the same question will get you the best results. For example if you asked five friends what day it is and four of them say monday you can conclude that it is monday. However there is always a chance that all four of your friends are wrong, to make sure the responses you get are correct it is important to ask more poeple. This idea of proving information with repeated results is even used in science. Scientist have to repeat experiments multiple times over to make sure that the results they get are consistant. The thing is, not every question has a right or wrong answer. A lot of the time people ask for others opinions or advice, when asking for other peoples opinion it is also very important that you ask multiple people. The reason for this is becuase everybody has different point of views on the same topic. When asking for an opinion it is good to know multiple point of views so that you can make the best conclusion.

Asking multiple people the same question does not only apply to when you talk with others but it can also teach you many important skills in life. For example if I am looking something up on the web it is important to be in the habbit of looking throung multiple sources. In life it is extremely important to pull information from multiple sources becuase it gives you more insight on the topic. For this reason it is super important to ask more than one person for advice.

asking more than one person for their opinion not only gives you a more educated conclusion, but it's a way to get to know people better. As humans we tend to want to grow stronger relationships with the people around us. People might not know it, but when they ask other people for their opinion or advice they are actually getting to know them better.

Taking the time to ask multiple people when you have a question can be very benificial becuase it will get you the most educated conclusion. Not only that but it will help you see other peoples point of veiw which is an important thing when building stronger relationships with the poeple around you. Now that you know this next time you need advice try asking more than just one person.",0
"I agree with this statement. Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are many reasons why this is the case. One reason is that many young people are busy with their own lives and do not have time to help out in their communities. Another reason is that many young people do not believe that they can make a difference in their communities. However, if young people give more time to helping their communities, they will be able to make a difference.

One example of how young people can make a difference in their communities is by volunteering their time. By volunteering their time, young people can help out in different areas of their community. They can also help out with different projects. This will help them to learn more about their community and to understand how they can help make it better.

Another way that young people can make a difference in their communities is by voting. By voting, young people can help to choose the leaders of their community. This will help to make the community more efficient and to improve the quality of life for all of it's residents.

Overall, I believe that young people should give more time to helping their communities. By doing this, they will be able to make a difference in the lives of those living in their community.",1
"In the modern world, it's uncommon to see someone without a car. Most people own at least one, and use it frequently. In America, suburban areas have few public transport options available making it difficult to get to work or to a store without using a car. However, cars are a massive source of greenhouse gas emissions. Not only that, car accidents have led to millions of injuries and deaths. While companies are working to procure cleaner, safer car models all the time, other countries are taking actions to lower the number of people using personal automobiles every day.

In Vauban, Germany, cars are actually banned. This town is much cleaner, and its residents are all happy with the rule. Stores and buildings are placed closer together, making them accessible to more people. Many people bike and walk to the places they need to be. Not only is it good exercise, it cuts down on the pollution going into the air and destroying the ozone. By not driving, no one has to be plagued by the worries of speeding, not going fast enough, getting hit, hitting someone else, or paying for gas. The town, finished in 2006, has done well so far. Germany isn't the only country interested in lowering car usage, though.

Recently, Paris was forced to enact a partial driving ban due to smog levels getting out of control. For a while, they were on the same level with Beijing, which is infamous for its horrible pollution. Car emissions have been, as Elisabeth Rosenthal put it in her article, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, choking cities. Paris' solution to the issue was forbidding cars with evennumbered licence plates to be driven one day, and then oddnumbered ones the next. Many people were unhappy with this, but the smog quickly cleared up to acceptable levels.

Meanwhile in Colombia, Bogota has a ban on cars as well, though it only lasts for one day a year. Contrasting with the reactions of the French, the citizens of the capitol willingly participate and use other means of transportation. Because of this, the usual traffic jams and wrecks are drastically minimized. This day without cars promotes public transport and lowering smog levels in big cities. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman, vocalized his opinion of the event, saying that It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. The carfree day has led to plenty of changes in the city, such as safer, better sidewalks, less traffic, and more condensed stores and restaurants that are closer together.

While it's definitely more common to see someone driving a car than biking to work, steps have been made towards a cleaner future that doesn't involve nearly so many cars. More Americans are limiting their car usage when they can every year. With cell phones and the Internet, it's now much easier to make car pooling arrangements, as well as interacting through the internet without having to leave and drive somewhere. The younger generation is becoming less concerned with getting a license, and is taking up organizing their lives around not having a car. With the recession, cars are becoming harder to afford and maintain. If people can get around those costs, they will. By limiting car usage, pollution levels are dropping, as well as the casualties that come with reckless driving.",0
"There is no denying that education is a life-long process. No matter how much formal education one has, there is always more to learn. This is because the world is constantly changing and evolving, and we need to constantly adapt and learn new things in order to keep up.

There are many benefits to lifelong learning. For one, it helps us to stay sharp and mentally agile as we age. It also helps us to stay up-to-date with the latest knowledge and technology so that we can be more productive and efficient in our jobs. Additionally, lifelong learning can help us to make new friends and connections, as well as to broaden our horizons.

Of course, there are also some challenges to lifelong learning. For example, it can be difficult to find the time and resources to keep learning new things as we get older. Additionally, some people may find it difficult to motivate themselves to keep learning.

Overall, I believe that the benefits of lifelong learning outweigh the challenges. I think that it is important for us to continuously learn and grow throughout our lives, in order to be our best selves.",1
"The so-called Face on Mars is simply a natural landform and was not created by aliens. While the distinct shape of the landform resembles a human face, leading some to believe it was an artificial structure, evidence clearly shows it was formed through natural geological processes over time.  

The article provides strong evidence that supports the Face being a natural landform rather than anything artificial. It describes how images of the landform taken at different times show erosion and changes to its appearance, proving it evolved naturally rather than being a static structure. Wind and other naturally occurring weather on Mars would shape and reshape sand and rocks over many years into varied formations that may occasionally resemble patterns we recognize. The Face also aligns with surrounding hills and its units were deposited horizontally, as is typical for natural rock and soil layers formed by weathering. 

Some key details further validate the natural origins of the Face. Its scale suggests any responsible beings would need to be impossibly large. The lack of any other artificial structures nearby makes the lone face implausible. Geological analysis identifies the rocks comprising the Face as typical Martian sediments, not unique composites one would expect from artificial building. Changes observed prove it underwent weathering with the Martian climate rather than remaining pristinely intact as an artificial object presumably would.

In conclusion, while speculation about the Face being an artificial construct created by aliens makes for an interesting hypothetical, evidence overwhelmingly shows it was formed through natural geological processes. The visible changes, alignment with surrounding terrain, and identification as typical sedimentary rocks provide strong scientific proof the so-called Face on Mars is simply a curious but natural landform sculpted by planetary conditions, not created by extraterrestrial visitors. Unless definitive evidence of artificial nature emerges, it remains rationally classified as a product of geological forces alone.",1
"In the United States, the process to pick the president is rather complicated. From nationwide voting to states that swing from party to party, it has intricate parts that most people find confusing. The electoral college, the process that in the end picks the president, is also rather complicated. It was made to be a compromise of picking the president by votes in congress and popular vote from citizens by the founding fathers. In modern times however, most citizens agree that popular vote makes more sense and that the electoral college has become rather bloated. In the case of finding reasons of why the electoral college doesn't really work is because private citizens vote for someone else to vote and that voters from different states don't control who the electors choose.

First of all, because of the electoral college, citizen's vote counts less when they vote for someone else to vote. Most citizens would relish the chance to vote for the candidate that they choose to support. But when they do vote, their vote only just might sway the electors vote. For example, during the 2000 presidential election, instead of the intended candidate winning the vote, the electoral college choose another. It removes any sense of personal worth when participating in general elections and makes it harder for some candidates to win.

Furthermore, not only do electors choose the president, but the votes themselves from private citizens don't control who the electors choose. Electors are people chosen at state conventions, presidential candidates, and state party's central committees. The amount is chosen on the populations of such states, making smaller states with still a significant population seem insignificant. However, the biggest slight is that the votes made by the citizens don't obligate electors to choose what the general population has already choosen. It takes away control from the people and is inherently wrong.

In conclusion, the electoral college is rather useless because it does the job that citizens already do and takes away control from them. By voting for electors, the electoral college process takes away a sense of self in elections while giving the power to choose the president to a group of about 200 people that can be persuaded or just simply choosen by the candidates themselves. Its a bloated system and should be dealt with.",0
"Professor Thomas Huang has a initiative way of finding out how someone is feeling. New computer software that can recognize emotions, some may view it as an invasion of privacy, or just straight up weird. I believe it could be a new way to not only help but to recognize your own feelings or your persona to others.

As we speak about the new invention I'd like to mention how it works. the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, there are 44 major muscles in the model that move like a human muscle for accuracy. Someone who is not only an expert with technology works on these but also someone who is an expert in mood, stability, etc works through these. Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman.

There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness...... These emotions are calculated per say by looks, movements, and the facial muscles. This could help dictate the feelings of someone who is unable to speak or vocalize. Now putting on a happy face is actually possible.",0
"Success is a goal that many people strive to achieve, yet some individuals may believe it is unattainable. However, success can be seen as something achievable for anyone with the right mindset and determination. In order to lead a successful life, one needs to set realistic goals within their own means then work hard in order to achieve them. The first step in achieving success is setting attainable goals by knowing your limitations and capabilities. When making goals you should also consider the time frame needed in order to reach them so that you do not become overwhelmed or over-extend yourself too quickly. If making smaller short term goals helps keep you motivated then this could help with long-term aspirations as well since progress will eventually be made if these are met on a regular basis. Once the proper ambition has been established, having perseverance and dedication are essential components of achieving success. Successful individuals have shown an unwavering commitment towards their dreams despite any obstacles they may face along the way; taking consistent action even when progress seems slow helps reassure one’s self-confidence while staying focused on their path towards success and always keeping momentum going forward no matter what happens along the journey is important towards reaching desired outcomes. Having strong interpersonal skills such as communication, collaboration, empathy etc., can also help greatly when striving for achievement since these allow for better relationships between different people which can open up possibilities leading closer toward fulfilling ambitions--having others who are willing provide advice or constructive criticism where needed can create more efficient outcomes when working alongside other likeminded individuals who share similar objectives. Finally learning from both successes and failures rather than allowing them define us allows us move past our shortcomings in pursuit of greater achievements down whatever road we choose take head on!",1
"Do you ever find yourself in a tough situation and in need of advice? Well you're not alone, almost everyone needs help at one point or another. Some people ask for multiple opinions when they need advice. I think this is a great idea because you can get multiple views on a topic,you won't have to worry about bias and it gives you different options on how to solve your problem.

To begin with, asking more than one person for advice means you will receive several different views on a topic. This is important when it comes to getting advice because you want to be able to make the best decision possible. For example, if you have a serious health issue arise in your life you might go to more than one doctor or specialist to make sure you're getting the right diagnosis and treatment. Even if you're not having health issues it never hurts to get different views to assist you in making the best choice. Always take these different views into consideration when making your final decision!

Additionally, getting multiple opinions means you won't have to worry about bias. When asking for advice or for someones opinion you don't want to ask just one person and end up getting a bias opinion. So, reaching out to more than one person almost eliminates the chances of that happening. When asking for advice I personally always ask people who are going to help me make the best decision and not someone who is going to give an opinion based on how they feel about the topic. Bias is hard to detect and sometimes it might even feel impossible,it can be confusing too. Just take your time and don't rush yourself when making decisions.

Lastly, you'll have many different options to choose from. This is so important, because then you won't have to feel stuck. For example, if you were to loose your job you would want another job or career to fall back on or in other words have a back up plan. Without another option you might feel confused or even lost. When making a decision the last thing anyone wants is to have all of those other emotions that's another reason have multiple options is important.

In conclusion, having multiple options,not receiving bias and, seeing different point of views are all reasons I believe it's a good idea to ask for multiple opinions when asking for advice and making a decision. Everyone will ask for advice at least one time so, when you do keep these tips in mind to help you make the best decision possible.",0
"Success is not an overnight process, it requires patience, hard work, and the ability to take risks. In my opinion, I strongly agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. This is because trying new things and taking risks opens up new possibilities, expands one's knowledge and experience, and helps in personal and professional growth. Below are some reasons and examples to support my argument.

Firstly, trying new things and taking risks opens up new possibilities. When we do things that we have never done before, we open ourselves up to new experiences and opportunities. For instance, a person who has always been interested in painting but has never tried it before may discover that they have a natural talent for it. They may then decide to pursue painting as a career, which could lead to great success and fulfillment. On the other hand, if they had never taken the risk of trying something new, they may have never discovered this talent and missed out on a great opportunity.

Secondly, trying new things and taking risks expands our knowledge and experience. When we step out of our comfort zones and try new things, we learn new skills and gain valuable experience. For example, a person who has always worked in the IT industry may decide to take up a new hobby like photography. Through this, they may learn new skills like composition, lighting, and editing, which they can then apply in their professional life to enhance their work. Additionally, by taking risks and trying new things, we gain a new perspective on life, which can help us in personal growth and development.

Lastly, trying new things and taking risks helps in personal and professional growth. When we take risks, we learn to overcome our fears and build confidence in ourselves. This, in turn, helps us to take on new challenges and achieve greater success. For instance, a person who has always been afraid of public speaking may decide to take a public speaking course. Through this, they may learn to overcome their fears and become a more confident speaker. This newfound confidence can then help them in their professional life, where they may be required to give presentations or speeches.

In conclusion, trying new things and taking risks is essential for personal and professional growth. Successful people are those who are not afraid to step out of their comfort zones and try new things. By doing so, they open themselves up to new possibilities, expand their knowledge and experience, and grow as individuals. Therefore, I strongly believe that trying new things and taking risks is crucial for anyone who wants to achieve success in life.",1
"Many of us are used to getting somewhere by simply using a car, but should we always use a car. If we limit car usage we can solve most of our problems. We can save comically and collect less polution In source one the German Suburbs are car free, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden generally. Car ownership is allowed, however where a carowner buys space for their car has to pay near 40,000, along with a home. As a result according to source one 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars , and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Many citizens complain when the gas prices go up, but if we limit our car usage we wont have to complain anymore. We will save money, because when we decrease the usage of cars we wont use as much gas or diesel. Heidrun Walter told Elisabeth Rosenthal that he now lives happier this way. Not only do we save money but we also relieve tension through out our bodies.

However we may not enjoy this new idea of limiting car usage some of us actually enjoy driving but, there are days where after a long day of working the last thing you want to be in is in traffic jams.It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, said businessman named, Carlos Arturo Plaza who rides a two seat bicycle with his wife.

In other ways that limiting car usage could help us is by eliminating pollution, of course everyone enjoys breathing in fresh air. By limiting car usage we can help lower polution. According to source two, After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, the usage of car produced so much smog that they had to ban driving. Many of use drive to so many places that are near by that in reality we dont really have to use our car not only will we reduce pollution, but we will also maintain ourselves fit by using different alternatives like, walking, running, ridding our bikes. Although some may say,  what if its an emergency, its fine we're only limiting car usage, we aren't goining to ban it forever.

If we limit car usage we can not only save money, but we can also reduce polution, and have a better lifestyle. Although these aren't the only ways limiting car usage can benefit us.",0
"The topic of my essay is the importance of learning foreign languages. Learning a foreign language can be an invaluable skill in today's increasingly diverse world. With more people than ever traveling across borders, being able to communicate with those who don't speak our native language has become essential. Knowing another language opens up opportunities for meaningful relationships and experiences that would otherwise remain out of reach. It also encourages cultural understanding, allowing us to appreciate the rich tradition and history behind each language we encounter. Those who are multilingual often enjoy greater job prospects due to their unique ability to interact with different cultures from around the world, as well as potential earnings increases since many employers favor candidates with multiple-language capability. Furthermore, studies suggest that bilingual individuals may have higher mental agility and better problem solving skills compared to monolingual speakers because they must constantly switch between languages when communicating or thinking about certain topics. Additionally, it is sometimes easier for these individuals to pick up additional languages due to their familiarity with how various linguistic systems work together; this could come in handy if a person wishes to learn yet another foreign tongue later on down the road!. . All in all, learning a foreign language offers numerous benefits beyond communication alone: increased job options and wages, improved cognitive abilities such as problem solving skills and multitasking abilities – plus it’s simply fun! Those willing to take on this challenge will be rewarded not only linguistically but culturally too – what better way is there get truly immersed in other countries than by speaking its people’s native tongue? As technology continues advancing at breakneck speeds making international collaborations easier than ever before - now may just be the perfect time for anyone looking for new opportunities abroad or enriching life experiences here at home!",1
"There is no clear answer when it comes to determining whether modern technology has made life more convenient or if life was better when technology was simpler. In many ways, modern technology has made life easier by providing conveniences such as cars, dishwashers, and smartphones. However, there are also negative aspects to modern technology, such as the negative effects on our health and the environment. Ultimately, it depends on the individual's perspective as to whether life is better or more convenient with modern technology.

From my perspective, modern technology has made life more convenient. I can easily communicate with people around the world, access information instantly, and travel to any place in the world with relative ease. For example, I can book a flight and find a hotel online in a matter of minutes, and I can communicate with people anywhere in the world via text, email, or social media. Additionally, I can easily purchase items online and have them delivered to my door.

While modern technology has made life more convenient, there are also negative aspects to consider. For example, our reliance on technology has led to the development of smartphones zombies, people who are so addicted to their phones that they walk around with their heads down, not paying attention to their surroundings. Additionally, our reliance on technology has had a negative impact on our health, as we are now spending more time indoors and are not getting enough exercise. Additionally, our use of technology has had a negative impact on the environment, as we are now producing more electronic waste than ever before.

In conclusion, while modern technology has made life more convenient in many ways, there are also negative aspects that should be considered. It ultimately depends on the individual's perspective as to whether life is better or more convenient with modern technology.",1
"Dear Senator of Florida, I am a 15 year old concerned citizen and I would like to address a serious problem. Our country's process of electing our president, the Electoral College. I believe there are certain aspects of this process which are both good, and bad, but still need to be revised. To fix this unfair system of election, we just need to change a few details of it, in particular, the states' winnertakeall system.

Of course there are people who agree with this method of voting, but i am not one of them, and neither is Bradford Plumer. In bradford excerpt from The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong, He explains to us the injustice of the electors that we vote for. Most of the time electors stay with their party's candidate, but sometimes they can be persuaded to switch sides. How would you like it if you and the majority of your state voted for a certain president through your states electors, and they went and stabbed you in the backfiguratively and voted for the other president. You have just been cheated out of your vote! That doesnt sound very democratic to me.

People do actually believe in this system of voting though, hard to believe, I know, but Richard A. poster's In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President gives us a pretty good reason of why they should. Richard explains to us the method of how a larger state with a large population, which would have a larger popular vote, has more weight than a smaller state with a smaller population and a smaller popular vote. He also tells us how there will always be an outcome, no matter what. Like how Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote and 51.3% of the popular vote. Cutting it a bit close there? Enough of that percentage of popular votes lost during the winnertakeall' method could change the election of the president.

So dont you see? Winnertakeall method just gained someone more votes than they deserved! Essentially robbing the other candidate of his votes! Once again Bradford Plumer hit the nail on the head with his description of the winnertakeall method. He understands the system and we are lucky enough he explains it to us in such easy terms. Instead of a candidate making his rounds to each of the states and raising his popularity, he ignores certain states that he knows he will get all of the votes for because he already owns a majority, 50%. It could be as little as 51% for him to gain all the votes of that state, and depending on the population of that state, lost more voters for the other candidate than an entire 's sum could give him. So candidates spend time in only a select few states trying to win the vote. Wouldn't this make you feel left out? Unimportant? Nothing but just a blip in the course of your country's history? I wouldnt want that feeling.

All ready a few states such as Maine and Nebraska have realized the stupidity of this system and have decided to change their voting method. This is why I write to you as our senator to help our state correct this process so we can fairly and justly choose our president, but what do I know, Im only 15.",0
"Extending the school day by one and a half hours can offer a range of academic benefits for students. Depending on the activities available, students might be able to spend extra time on their studies and gain new knowledge and skills. Additionally, longer school days could provide students access to speciality programs, such as sports or music, and could offer more time for collaboration in team projects or mentor relationships. 

However, it is important to examine the potential implications of the extended learning time. There is the possibility that students may experience undue pressure due to the extra hours in school, which could lead to burnout or decreased motivation. Furthermore, the nutrition of students should be considered, particularly with regard to meals that may be needed during the extended hours. In such cases, adequate access to food and drink is essential. 

Overall, an extended school day has the potential to positively impact a student's academic performance, but certain issues should be addressed before making any revisions to the current school schedule.",1
"Rough Draft

Hey there, Someone yelled then you relize thats the call of friend that is about to ask for some advice. Many people take advice from others to help with problems they think they can't do by them self. Which leads to the question why take advice from others? They take advice because they don't neccarly need help, but want help to take the easy way out of things. By doing this they second guss them selfs and go and ask more people for more advise to see if the other person advice was wrong, or they have no idea what to do. If that's the case then they take the advice of others to help them with his/her problem by taking the best advice possible, asking how to do what you don't, and knowledge.

Firstly, by taking the best possible advice you would want to go to multiple people for there advice, experince, and help. By going to someone who has already given advice to others they will probably have a lot of imformation for you to have about your issue. If you go to someone with a ton of experince there advice would probaly be the best. Lastly if you go to someone with the experince you have you could give advice to each other, making it good for both of you.

Next, you could ask for tips or pointers on how to give advice to others, learning, and on how to take action. Asking for advice to give other people advice is a great idea if you want to help others out and yourself. By learning you could gain experince like Mrs. Generic_Name to advice to others. Lastly by taking action you take the advice you gain and give it to others.

Finaly, by going to multiple people you gain more knowledge including their perspectives, there reasons on what they would do, and how they would resolve the matter. First by knowing someones perspective you will know on how they would do stuff their own way. Second the reasons on why they would do what they are going to do will help with your actions by putting other reasons together. Lastly by knowing how they would solve the issue it would help to take others solutions all in all.

In conclusion, people who ask others for help are wanting the best advice possible, asking for tips they don't know how to do themselfs, and knowledge. Those who take advice will likely feel better when they actually use the advice to solve there problem and will enjoy it. So don't be afraid to ask for advice from others it will benifit you in the long run.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my perspective on the continuation of the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analysis of various viewpoints, I firmly believe that we should keep the Electoral College rather than switch to a popular vote system. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the Electoral College presents several advantages that should be considered in this matter.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. Unlike the popular vote, where disputes and recounts may occur, the Electoral College system minimizes the likelihood of such situations. As seen in the 2012 election, President Obama received a significant portion of the electoral votes compared to his popular vote share. The winner-take-all basis of electoral votes in most states allows for clear victory margins and reduces the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, which would then necessitate a decision by the House of Representatives.

Secondly, the Electoral College system promotes the representation of all regions across the United States. Since no single region has enough electoral votes to secure the presidency, candidates are encouraged to appeal to voters across the country. This requirement ensures that a president has trans-regional appeal and avoids the possibility of a candidate with only regional support being elected. It also prevents voters from feeling disenfranchised and reinforces the notion that the president represents all Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states. In a closely contested election, candidates concentrate on states where the outcome is uncertain, thereby encouraging voters in these states to carefully evaluate the candidates and their policies. This process leads to more informed voting decisions and allows swing state voters to play a crucial role in shaping the election's outcome. By giving thoughtful voters greater influence, we ensure that the most impactful and informed choices are being made.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as prescribed by the Constitution, often results in large states losing relative political weight. However, the Electoral College restores some of that balance by allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress. This approach ensures that presidential candidates must pay attention to the concerns and interests of voters in both small and large states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the election process when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College system avoids the challenges associated with run-off elections and ensures a smooth transition of power.

While there are those who argue against the Electoral College, citing concerns over fairness and representation, it is important to note that nearly half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite the knowledge that their individual vote may not swing the national outcome. This demonstrates that voters participate to express their political preferences rather than purely to affect the election's result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several key advantages that outweigh the arguments in favor of a popular vote. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages voter engagement in swing states, balances the influence of big and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. While the system has its flaws, it has stood the test of time and continues to be a fair and effective method for electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I believe that retaining the Electoral College is in the best interest of our democracy and the United States as a whole. I hope you will carefully consider the advantages it offers and take them into account when addressing any proposed changes to our election system.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The technology of  Facial Action Coding System should not be used to read students emotions to read in a class room and the use of this technology is not valueable. Why? because no student would want to let a machine tell what their emotions are and what they are feeling. In the text it says that this technology can calculate when your face is sad, happy, angry, scared, bored.

This technology won't be able to detect all the movements of the face and detect what our feelings show threw a smile we put on our face .

Not all technology work well and if this technology were to detect a humans feelings trew their face it wouldn't work because not all tecnology work well and everyones face is different. How would you be able to detect a older humans face and a younger humans face?, not all technology would be able to calculate that and this technology will possibly pick up the wrong feeling the person makes. The person might feel sad but their face might show a bit of anger or a person might be feeling calm and relaxed but the technology might pick up that the humans face might be angry . You might be able to tell a persons feelings their the face they make, because maybe this person might be your friend and you know what faces they make when they are worried or mad or sad. Not this technology especially if it has never detected a new before and every single persons face is different. My opinion to this is this technology would not be a very good idea especially if a technology knows more about your feelings then you do. Some people might put on a happy face to show others that they are okay and nothing is bothering them but inside they might be in trouble or worried.

Many people hide their feelings/emotions so no one can make such a big deal out of them.",0
"In today's world, we are bound to face the consequences of our actions. One of the most significant issues that have arisen globally is pollution. Many people say that we have developed into a throw-away society because we are filling up our environment with so many plastic bags and rubbish that we cannot fully dispose of. I completely agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion.

Firstly, our excessive use of plastic is the root cause of the problem. Plastic bags are widely used in supermarkets, grocery stores, and shops. These bags are easy to carry and are also cheap. However, they are not biodegradable, and hence they end up in the landfill, where they take hundreds of years to decompose. Moreover, plastic waste is also a significant threat to our marine life. Many aquatic animals like turtles, fishes, and whales mistake plastic bags for food and end up consuming them, leading to their death.

Secondly, we have developed a culture of consuming products and throwing them away without considering their environmental impact. Materialism has become the norm, and we are driven by our desire to consume more and more, irrespective of the waste it generates. A classic example of this is the fast fashion industry, which produces millions of clothes every year, which ultimately end up in landfills. This practice is unsustainable, and it is high time that we rethink our consumption patterns.

Lastly, our attitude towards waste disposal is also a significant cause of concern. We have been brought up in a culture where we do not think twice before throwing away things that we do not need. However, we need to understand that waste disposal is a collective responsibility, and we need to take ownership of the waste that we generate. We need to segregate our waste and dispose of them correctly. We also need to promote the 3Rs - Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.

In conclusion, the issue of pollution today is a result of our actions over the years. We need to take responsibility for our actions and change our attitude towards consumption and waste disposal. It is high time that we become conscious of our environmental impact and take measures to mitigate the damage we have caused.",1
"Aliens on Mars making a huge monument is very contarversial. Some people think that the monument is made by aliens but some people think it is man made. But now the face on mars is being photo graghed with better detail than ever. The face on mars is natural.

NASA has sent spacecraft to observe the surface of mars and the first on they sent was Viking 1 took pictures of the surface of mars and there seemed to be a face and they thought that there was an anceint civilaztion that built it. Later on they sent another spacecraft to take even better detail of the surface of mars. And in 1998 they got even more detial than in 1976. Then in 2001 They took pictures of it again and with even more resolution.

Others say that it looks like something made by somehing esle other than humans or nature. And they say it has the look of being man made. But it has been photograghed numorous time and with even better detail and it look like it was made by nature not some other beings. It also states in the artical That a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars.

The face on mars is natural. There is more evidence of it being natural than being made by aliens. The photos are better and they clearly show that it is just a rock formation.",0
"As technology continues to evolve, it is becoming increasingly important for educational institutions to implement online education. Online education offers a number of advantages over traditional in-person learning, from convenience and cost savings to an expanded student body and greater access to course materials. While these benefits are obvious, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed in order for online education programs to be successful. One of the major difficulties with implementing effective online learning programs is ensuring quality instruction. A key factor in this respect is making sure teachers have the proper training for teaching virtually. Educators must become familiar with technologies such as web conferencing tools, lecture capture systems, software simulations, etc., so they can integrate them into their curricula both effectively and efficiently. Additionally, teachers should learn how best use virtual communication platforms like discussion boards and chatrooms which allow students who may not see one another regularly or ever form relationships that can enhance their learning experience. Another significant challenge related to delivering successful online courses involves creating engaging content that stimulates student interest while simultaneously covering the required material at a suitable pace. Since students aren’t physically present during lectures or discussions it becomes even more essential that content be well designed so that learners stay focused on lessons rather than getting sidetracked by unrelated topics or activities available on the internet when things get dull or boring. To better facilitate this process educators must become knowledgeable about multimedia packages like video streaming services and interactive apps which enable them incorporate media elements into lectures much easier than before thus providing more interesting experiences for their classes as a whole . Finally, instructors of online classes need take measures ensure adequate student support is available since many remote learners lack direct interactions with faculty mentors often found on campus . This means having advisors prepared answer questions promptly via email or other messaging channels as well instituting policies guarantee quick responses technical problems associated with hardware/software necessary participating in class Furthermore should organized orientations new members events bring together distant participants encourage collaborative projects The ultimate goal",1
"Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote,unless you try to do something beyound what you have already mastered , you will never grow . Based on mine on experiences, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Because people grow up every single day, people learn new things from things they mastered in,and people grow no matter what they in .

Firstly,people learn new things everyday. when it comes to studies and growing, alot of people try their best to master in what they are trying to do. Most people spend more time to mastered in what they want to do but the more you study the more you grow knowing all kinds of things. For example,when I first move to America, it was hard for to master or get used to the culture ,food ,speaking but the more I learn more about the country the more i grow in it. now if I tell you can speak english good you will not believe it. you do need to move beyound what have mastered in to grow .Because you can mastered in math but you don't know the whole thing about stuff. so I think the more person do what they are mastered in the more they grow. Specially, people like my who have been teaching for this whole life is even grow as new generation comes in. In fact ,even a busness can only grow if the CEO of the company have mastered on that position and ready to learn more things about it. Besides this ,people grow every single day.

However, Some people grow single day. because the more you study for the things you have mastered the more you grow. For example ,it like teaching a kids how to eat. it does matter how mastered you have be paient with kids,

teach them everyday and more the you the kids the more grow to understand not only how to eat but so many thing they saw from you. we may mastered in one thing but it have so many things connected to it .that can help throght life without changing your the career ,job or whatever it may be. I like how some student take cosmetology, they take this for two year to have a certificate but that does mean the student all have mastered in it so that is it. you learn about it to take you a different levels. it laso teach them to skill not only on make up and hair but to be paient with costumers and their own friend too. moreover, people can grow throght new education about their woke.

Sometimes, people grow through new ability about their work or what have mastered in. people normally change or grow when there is to learn about what they mastered in. I said this because many learn more grow when there is a new change in syetem of education, economics ,bussines. For example ,doctor grow more when they have to learn more about something have ever seen all done but in same field work. like how you get to study more when you take IB course but not just they bring new things to help do you work on time and stuff.

In summary,I think that the qoute Emerson wrote was not right because how can someone mastered some that can not help them grow .people thing will help them grow in future .I think people who are hopping jobs to jobs or whatever they are doing is bad , because doen't help you to grow .because you get enouch time them you swtiches.",0
"There are many advantages of limiting car usage and today ima tell you a few reasons why that is true.

Time after time day after day we use our cars or motorcycles to get from point A to point B some may think that by driving from point A to point B is harmless but im here to tell other wise. Driving your car or motorcycles everday to work causes pollution in the air it makes the air we breath nasty an unhealty it even causes the temputure to rise which is a big no no the antarticle will melt an rise sea levels. So limiting car usage makes the air a little cleaner an healtier to breath

Limiting car usage even helps you save a little extra money cause with gas prices so high it aint cheap to get from point A to point B it cost more to travlel. In some places they even offerd free transport from friday to monday which is great! who wouldnt want free transport i mean whats better than saving money an helping the pollution decrease making the air more freasher an clean. Atfer days of near record pollution paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city those who refused to obey were fined 22 euro($31) other got the vechials impounded

The less cars on the street the less likley accidents are to happpen sometimes the roads are just to pack an squished you can braley get by thats why many car accidents happen with the car free day makes everyone a little more safer. since the car free day the parks and sports centers have bloomed many peopel are out having a good time riding thier bikes an enjoying the fresh air they dont have to worry about cars hitting them or wasting gas an polluting the air.

In the untied states the enviromental protection agency is promting car reduced communities. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill. Americans are buying fewer cars drving less and getting fewer licenses each year goes by.",0
"There are two schools of thought when it comes to how the media should treat celebrities. Some believe that celebrities are unfairly targeted by the media and should be given more privacy. Others believe that this is the price of their fame. I believe that the latter is true.

While it is true that celebrities are often put under a microscope by the media, I believe that this is the price of their fame. Celebrities choose to live their lives in the public eye and, as such, they should expect to have their every move scrutinized. It is unfair to expect privacy when one has chosen to live their life in such a public way.

That being said, I do believe that the media should be respectful in their coverage of celebrities. There is a line between reporting on someone’s life and invading their privacy, and the media should be aware of that line. However, at the end of the day, I believe that it is the responsibility of the celebrity to be aware of the risks of living their life in the public eye and to make the decision accordingly.",1
"School is an invaluable opportunity to learn valuable lessons that can stay with us throughout our lives. One of the most important lessons students can learn at school is how to think critically and objectively. Understanding critical thinking can help students develop better problem-solving skills, make more informed decisions, and ultimately contribute to more successful outcomes in their future endeavors.

Critical thinking in the classroom teaches students to think beyond what is being presented to them and to challenge assumptions and ideas. With the help of teachers, students learn how to evaluate various sources of information, identify multiple perspectives on an issue, and weigh the evidence to arrive at a reasonable conclusion. This can make them better informed citizens, better prepared in their jobs, and better able to participate in critical conversations.

Learning how to think critically is also important because it helps us develop our own independent thought processes and strengthen our ability to make our own judgments. It encourages a sense of curiosity and exploration and allows us to better analyze existing data objectively to draw our own conclusions about the world around us. This can help us become more confident and independent learners, which can help us in our future studies and careers.

Ultimately, developing critical thinking skills is an essential life skill that can benefit students in their future. It can help them to better make decisions, more effectively participate in critical conversations, and confidently navigate various challenges they may face in their lives.",1
"Technology

Technology have changed people in a lot of ways. People use technology almost everywhere they go. Technology, sometimes, is helpful and sometimes its not. People use technology to find resources that are very helpful. Some people use technology to play games and discover inconvenient sites. Technology change peoples the way they live their lives. Using technology can have some intense effect on peoples health issues. Technology can cause people to perform bad things.

Technology can change the way people live their lives. When people are using technology, they can't focus on what the other person is saying. Technology cause people of losing communication with their parents or their friends. Young people use technology more than old people. Young people are addicted to technology which is bad for them. School's do not like to let students use their cellphones during classes, because they will not focus on learning anything. If someone could take the technology away from young people, they would not communicate with their parents or not even make an eye contact with them. Technology can cause a bad habit for them.

Using technology can have some bad effect on peoples health. A lot of people die in car accidents on account of them using technology while driving a car. People can get addicted to their technology devices, which is bad for their eyes. Using a lot of technology can cause people to go blind. Young people don't get enough sleep because they use their phones and stay up late. Some parents let their kids to use technology and avoid what it can do to their kids. Some parents do care about their kids health issues and they take their devices away. Technology can cause people to get hurt.

"Venus the second planet from the sun and very dangerous. A thick cloud of carbon dioxide and heats to high for the humen body, but desipite all of the dangers the autor of this passage still wants to go. Despite all of the dangers is this really worth to pursuit.

The aurtor gives us a idea in paragraph 3 of how dangerous Venus is. A 97% thick cloud of carbon dixoide. Heats high enough to kill a humen, up to eight hundred degress! Thunder storms with frequent lightnign strikes that would kill a humen if stuck by one. Lastly its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then earths that would crush a submarine, machines built to withstand pressure! Many more dangers await us on Venus but the possiblity behind all of these dangers is amazing.

The reason the autor wants to go to Venus is just because of human curisotiy and insight of the planet itself theres no real claim for anything else. (NASA) is the only scientific reason stated but even then all the text the autor shows is making a craft to just hover over Venus nothing about actuly exploring the plant. The autor's aproche to this subject could have been more enhancing if they would have given scientfic reasons then just for human curisity.

Venus the sister to earth if she had deadly wepons and was ready to strike you if you got close. The autor makes good points on why we should go there but if you were to ask me I would build and wast recorses on this if this was the convincing paper.",0
"Do you like to be given multiple good opinions instead of just one? Being given multiple opinions or viewpoints on a situation can be much more helpful than just one. The three reasons multiple opinions are better than just one is: You have more overall brain power and knowledge, a variety of opinions to use to benefit yourself, and the advice you are given may be incorrect, not helpful, or you may not like it; Therefore, having another opinion to lean on can be very useful when a scenario like this occurs.

The first reason I declared why multiple opinions are better is you gain more knowledge about how your peers or even the public views things. For example, just recently baseball season started up again, and I needed a new baseball bat. So, I began browsing online, reading reviews for each bat and seeing what comments or opinions people had about them. I asked my father and some of my teammates for their opinions on which bat to purchase. I asked not just whether the bat was good or bad, but what were some features they liked and some features they disliked about it. Every time I heard someones opinion, I acquired some of the information they told me. Using that I was able to make a smart and thought out decision on which baseball bat I should purchase.

Next, my second reason is talking to more people for their opinion on something means you will have either a mixed variety of opinions or a large number of people with the same opinion on something. Currently, across the world we are experiencing a global health crisis with the rapid spreading of the Coronavirus. Say for instance, you are head of the school board and you have to make a decision for your whole county as to whether or not our schools should be closed or not. The safety of our students, staff, and teachers relies on your decision. If you go around and collect everyone's opinions, you can combine them to come up with the best idea possible. Hearing as many people's opinions as you can and combining them is very beneficial when making decisions.

Lastly, my third and final reason to prove that having multiple people voice their opinions is better than just one is that you may not always find a persons advice helpful. If you ask one person for an opinion on something and you don't find it useful, you have nothing else to help you. On the other hand, if you have collected multiple opinions from multiple people, instead of just one, it doesn't matter if you don't like someones advice. You will still have more pieces of advice or opinions from different people to use for your benefit. That is why when asking for opinions, it is crucial to hear and collect one from multiple people, not just one person.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is very beneficial. Only hearing one opinion is alright, but hearing more than one is only that much better. My three reasons I have this claim are, a persons advice simply might not be helpful to you and having a variety of opinions that you can refer to and use for help is important. My last reason, with hearing more people's opinions you can acquire more knowledge, and in the end, knowledge is key.",0
"Many people in the world today are quite desperate to see change in their life. They are seeking a better life, something new and fun, and to do it for cheap. Walking or riding bike is the cleanest way to do all these things at once. The more people that are not using cars, the more accidents will be prevented. And there is no limit to how many people you can walk with. There's no cost to walk, you just do it. It's something the whole family can do together and enjoy the journey somewhere rather than being on their devices. In addition, fuel is not emmiting forom your body into the atmosphere rupturing the Ozone creating all this Global Warming. Creating a world where transportation vehicles are obsolete will nt only benefit the people of this world, but the planet itself, and for the future generations.

Accidents would be almost nonexistent if we were to gert rid of motherized vehicles. In the article, in German suburb, life goes on without cars the author talks about how there are already cities in the world that have not banned cars, but choose not to use them. The people in those areas are close to no accidents at all. If there are no cars in the road then how can there be a car accident? The way the Germans started to remove cars forom the road is by removing parking lots. There are only two anywhere in that suburb and they are so inconvient.

Any doctor in the world no matter how young, or where they live will tell their patients that exercise is the only way to stay healthy, energized, and feeling young throughout their life. Without cars getting forom one place to another will require another means for transportation. Now either wait for the bus and be late or wake up a little earlier and walk or ride your bike. It's cheap and effective not only for you but the environment.

Fuel creates a gas that later rips open holes in the Ozone layer. Creating Global Warming which then in turn leads to higher taxes to allow for more money to be used in research to save it. Or you can take action now and save up for a bike rather than a car. It takes less management and doesnt take fuel. Just good old man power. It's tragic in Paris bans driving due to smog, Delivery companies complained of lost revenue. this world is what we are leaving our children and their children to live in. Make sure you leave it better than when you came.

In the four articles they all talk about the negative in driving rather than the positive. The reason is because there are more negatives to the industrialization of a car rather than just going back to the way our ancestors used to be. Even our young as our vary own parents are amazed at how much damage this generation is doing to themselves and everything around them. It is the result of inventions like the automobile. Vehicles are efficient in some way, but you might prefer to take a bit more time here and there to allow that you can be there when your children have children.",0
"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom are valuable. It's valuable because it can detect when the students are bored, or confused with the subject they are learning or the lesson the teacher is teaching, If the Facial Action Coding System is used in classrooms it could possible help more students because the system could notify the teacher on who might be having trouble or major difficulties.

I claim that the value of using the technology to read students' emotional expressions would be good. Evidence to back my statement up is  Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. More evidence to back my statement up is A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Which I believe that woudl be a wonderful source for not only students that are confused about something they are learning, but for the teachers too because it would help them know when a student is struggling, or is not really interested as much as they should be.

The use of this technology to read the emotional ecpressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Evidence that can be use to prove that the statement is correct is A calssroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. More evidence to show that the statement is true is Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. I believe that the Facial Action Coding System does indeed show some value in a classroom.

In conclusion, the technology would be a magnificent value to classrooms. It would help a ton of students that might be affraid to ask for help, or to tell the teacher that they aren't really learning from the way the teacher is teaching a lesson because it doesn't excite them as much. Which would be a great idea to bring FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to school classrooms.",0
"Americans throughout the country believe that the Electoral College isn't fair and believe that they deserve a more direct voting system to the president, other than voting for electors. These reasons are made by the people because they want more and more power in the government. What the people want is almost always the risky option, especially when the topic is government. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept as the way it is now, and not a direct voting systemm for American citizens.

As said in the previous statement, Americans that want the Electoral College gone are lurking for more power when it comes to rules. Unfortunately, if the government's decisions were left in the hands of the people, the country's state would be in anarchy. On the other hand, the electoral college offers Congress and the Senate a share of the power, and the American citizens a share of the power as well. For example, if the Electoral College began to diminish, then became wiped out immediately, the government could do nothing less but to watch as the people choose the president that they want. Sometimes, what is wanted by the people may not always be the right thing.

Moving on, almost 60 percent of all American voters stated that they would rather have a direct voting systemm, putting aside the Electoral College. What most people are not seeing is that the direct voting and Electoral College systemm are very similar. The difference between the two is, that when Americans vote in the Electoral College, they are voting for electors that go towards the president, and when Americans vote directly to the president, those same amount of votes go to the president as well. If the voting systemm was based off of a direct route to the presidents side, then there would be too many votes to count, which is why have representatives towards each state is one of the glories of the Electoral College.

Finally, the popular voting systemm is very flawed, considering that there are states that have millions more people people than others. Some states even double the size of other states according to population. For example, New York's population most likely doubles the population of Florida's, but thanks to the Electoral College, the representative and population ratio weighs out, giving each state an equal amount of votes toward their president. Now, if the popular voting systemm was in place, then states like New York would outnumber states like Florida's votes by millions. It would not be as fair as it is now if the popular voting systemm replaced the Electoral College.

In conclusion, the Electoral college has many positive outlook like keeping the voting systemm fair and not giving too much power to either side when voting is the subject. Although many Americans believe that the electoral College is causing the wrong presidents to win, it does not make a difference either way because of the way that the Electoral College evens out the votes.",0
"Self-esteem is defined as having a positive opinion of oneself, and achievement as reaching a goal or standard. In the essay, the writer explains how elements of self-esteem, achievement, confidence, trust, learning and work are integral to success. For instance, to gain the trust of others, a person needs to demonstrate confidence and dependability in their work. Similarly, a sense of personal fulfillment and self-esteem is heightened when one achieves success in learning experiences. To illustrate this, the author provides an example of how engaging in meaningful work and activities can lead to academic and career success. Another example the author gives is how hard work and dedication can lead to professional achievements and a sense of inner worth. Through these examples, the essay expresses the importance of the concepts of self-esteem, achievement, confidence, trust, learning, and work in enabling success.",1
"If you want good advice would you rather have the good advice because of multiple people's ideas or be lazy and only ask one person for advice and it will be a more likely a mediocre opinion. When asking for multiple opinions on a subject you most likely can thrive in what the advice was for. When people ask for advice,they often talk to multiple people because of better opinions,different ideas,and most people when asking for advice they would not be lazy and ask multiple people.

When people are asking for advice,they often talk to multiple people because they might have a better opinion because they could have thought of something that you have not come up with and that could help them majorly or it could help them in a minor way but it still helps them. When I ask for advice I want to find a common idea throughout all the people I ask because that could a common and a better way to do the thing I am asking for. The opinion could be smarter and move thought out because people give different advice. When giving advice you tell them most of the time what you would do in there situation and based on your experiences that makes your answer. When you are getting opinions you can build trust with that because they can use there advice and it works they can now depend on your judgments on certain things or maybe everything depending on the person. In my experience when I use the advice that a person has given to me it helps form a bond because I know I can trust that person with there judgment on that certain subject. In conclusion when people ask for your advice, they will most of the time talk to another person about it also but they do it so they can get a better opinion because of people thinking of something you haven't,smarter or more efficient opinions,and can build trust with a person because they give you a better opinion.

When people ask for advice,they often talk to multiple people because everybody might have different ideas or opinions. When getting different ideas it can help you because you can see in a new and different perspective and a new outlook and there advice could mean something totally different then what you thought it meant. When I learned about a new perspective I looked at different things in two perspectives and now if people ask for advice then I become more versatile became of the depth I have in this area and I can look at it two ways. There is always another method and that is to combine both ideas and or opinions together to make one really good piece of advice. If I were to combine two ideas that are both good the opinions on it will not be the same as having one piece of good advice because of the value each one has and the importance that each one has and combining two good piece of opinions together they advice can give more help and is going to be a efficient and it will be better advice. When you start combining opinions together it starts to become a habit and it will be a good work habit because when you are working in groups you can get better feedback to the bettering of the group. When I started asking for different opinions in group work or group projects it helped me better than someone else just doing it for me then the group has different ideas thriving and making it a successful project or piece of work we are doing. In closing when people ask for opinions, they often talk to multiple people because they want different ideas and or opinions because they can get a new perspective,they can combine ideas,and they can create good working habits.

People think that just one person is enough to ask for advice but what if the advice is not good and it very one sided or a mediocre advice? If you ask for advice and the advice is not good then asking only one person is a lose-lose situation and then you start to lose trust in that person because of the failed advice and then something might happen since the advice has failed. If you ask multiple people what they say you can combine your's and there's and have a more than decent advice then have a set up to fail advice. If you are being lazy and only asking one person for advice it is more of a lose-lose situation then a win-win situation because of the failure that is awaiting you and even if the advice works it will not work as well as asking multiple people for the same advice. I have only asked one person for advice before and the advice ended up not working and then something bad happened after because of only asking one person and evidently I found out that asking more people is more efficient and better than asking only one. In summary when people act lazy and only ask one person instead of asking more there is more of a loss then gain and that is why asking the same question to multiple people are efficient.

I believe that you should ask multiple for advice before making your final answer. If you ask for advice you should ask multiple people because of the better opinions,the different ideas,and most of the time people will not be lazy about asking for advice. I believe that when asking for advice for multiple people it helps you understand in different ways and helps you grow on your way of thinking and in a way makes you more knowledgeable.",0
"I agree that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are many reasons for this, including the increasing popularity of public transportation, the increasing popularity of electric vehicles, and the increasing popularity of ride-sharing services.

Public transportation is becoming increasingly popular, as more and more people are choosing to use it instead of driving their own cars. This is because public transportation is more affordable than driving, it is more environmentally friendly, and it is more convenient.

Electric vehicles are becoming more and more popular, and this is because they are much more environmentally friendly than traditional cars. Electric vehicles don’t produce any emissions, and they are much more efficient than traditional cars.

Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft are also becoming more popular. These services allow people to use their smartphones to book rides from other drivers. This is a much more convenient way to get around than using traditional taxis.

All of these factors are contributing to the decreasing number of cars in use. In twenty years, there will likely be far fewer cars on the roads than there are today. This is good news for the environment, for the economy, and for the people who live in cities.",1
"Many places around the world are limiting the usage of cars. If more places created regulations like these, it may drastically change the environment, for the better.

Vauban, a suburb in Germany, made conditions in the neighborhood almost impossible to own a car. While it may seem like an annoyance, many of the residents are happier this way. According to Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way. While many people may see having to give up or not use their can an annoyance, if they get used to it they might find that not using their cars may be a good thing.

Instead of having to hear car engines and honking horns, they can take a relaxing walk or even a bike ride somewhere.

Limiting car usage would also be very helpful in cleaning up the environment. In In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars the author states, Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. Limiting the amount people can drive their cars could reduce a hefty amount of pollution in our air. In France, they limitied the amount of people who were allowed to drive for two days. Paris has more pollution in their air then most European cities, but putting regulations on who could drive significantly reduced the amount of smog in just a few days, according to Robert Duffer.

Putting regulations on car usage can also make the area you live in a much nicer place. In Colombia, a few cities have an annual Day Without Cars, where citizens are fined for using their cars. As a result, things like restaurants and malls have been being built. They are repairing more sidewalks and building new bicycle paths. Parks are being used more often. The communities would be much nicer places with out the frequent use of cars.

Limiting the use of cars is a very good thing. It helps the environment, and it helps make the world a nicer place.",0
"I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I have seen many successful people over the years and I have noticed that they always seem to be trying new things and taking risks. They are not afraid to experiment and to try different things. They are not afraid of failure either. They are always looking for ways to improve and to be better. Failures are actually a sign of success. If a person is unsuccessful at something, that is usually a sign that they are trying hard and that they are willing to take risks. Successful people are constantly learning and they are constantly trying new things. They are not afraid to fail and they are not afraid of obstacles.

I think that this is a very important thing to remember. Successful people are always trying to improve and to be better. They are always looking for ways to be more successful and to make their lives easier. They are not afraid to take risks and they are not afraid of failure. This is a very important thing to remember.",1
"Electoral College is loosing potential voters and making everything extremly difficult and unfair!

Small states most likley have the most potenital and smartest voters and they just get left there. No canidates go and visit and talk about the presidental run. They just think they'll get there votes. All they care about is the big states. Then the popular votes may not even count because of the Electoial College. It's insane and disrepectful! I mean, yeah, big states have alot of people but its unfair for the little states to be told nothing and see nothing and then go vote for someone they barley know anything about.

Sometimes the popular votes dont even help with winning. What's the point? Exactly, there isn't one. Wouldn't you rather see someone people want as president instead of someone who won just because the Electoial College. I sure would and so would a bunch of other people.

The Electoral College is unfair on the most basic level to voters because of the winner-takes-all system, only caring about the swing states. In 2000 seventeen states didn't see any of the canidates at all. That's just crazy and dumb! Every state should see the canidates even if it's the small states.

The arguements to keep the Electoral College are mostly assertins with out much basis in reality and the ones that are against are the best arguements with great facts and it's reality. Ohip have yet to make a swing vote. In 1997, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio abd 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The single best argument against the electoial collefe is what we might call the disaster factor. The american people shopidl consider themselves lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest electon crisis in the century; the system allows fior so much worst to happnened.

Most states have the Winner take all system except Maine and Nebraska, they each have variation of Poportional Represnation. Why go through all the work of trying to get popular votes, and have them not help at all.

I say we vote with popular votes because everyone wants to see the people that is more popular then someone who only won because of the Electorial Vote!",0
"Education is a crucial aspect of human life, and it is essential to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in their future endeavors. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts. In my opinion, I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This essay will provide specific reasons and examples to support my stance.

Firstly, understanding ideas and concepts is more beneficial in the long run than memorizing facts. Facts are often subject to change, and what may be true today may not be true tomorrow. On the other hand, ideas and concepts are timeless and can be applied to various situations. For instance, a student who understands the concept of gravity can apply it to different scenarios, such as understanding why objects fall to the ground or why planets orbit the sun. In contrast, a student who only memorizes the fact that the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s² may not be able to apply this knowledge to other situations.

Secondly, understanding ideas and concepts promotes critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When students understand concepts, they can analyze and evaluate information, make connections between different ideas, and apply their knowledge to real-world situations. This is particularly important in today's society, where critical thinking skills are highly valued. For example, a student who understands the concept of supply and demand can use this knowledge to analyze market trends and make informed decisions about investments.

Lastly, understanding ideas and concepts fosters creativity and innovation. When students understand concepts, they can think outside the box and come up with new ideas and solutions. This is particularly important in fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), where innovation is crucial. For instance, a student who understands the concept of renewable energy can come up with new and innovative ways to harness energy from natural sources.

In conclusion, understanding ideas and concepts is more important than memorizing facts. It promotes long-term learning, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity and innovation. While facts are important, they should be used to support and reinforce concepts rather than being the sole focus of education. Therefore, educators should focus on teaching students to understand ideas and concepts rather than just memorizing facts.",1
"Cell phone Usage

The cellphone may look harmless, but in reality it's known to kill thousands. The more and more people think about using their cellphones while driving, the more and more anything fatal can happen at any second. People often become terrified of the possible outcomes that can occur while being distracted by their cell phones. People often drive with their little sisters or brother, perhaps even babies and kids. Imagine feeling your phone vibrate and you feel like you have the need to take a quick second to look at what was the vibration on your phone.

Somehow in that one second you took a glance at your phone, you crashed with a family member inside the vehicle and had to be sent to the emergency room. People would feel very guilty about the consequences they have caused due to the usage of their cellphone while driving.

Cell phones are used for communication. In the beginning of the cell phone times, were primarily used for calling other individuals. Presently they are more often used for text messaging, and according to distraction. gov , because texting requires visual, manual and conmentive attention from the driver, It is by far the most alarm distraction. Cell phones are also used for entertainment such as browsing the web, watching movies, playing games, and listening to music.

Fatal car accidents can occur while using your cellphone while driving. An example of this would be passengers that are located inside a car where the driver has made the decision to use their phone while driving, which can lead to losing their lives because due to the driver making this decision they're putting their own lives at risk and lose their lives along with the driver. Also other passengers and drivers that are located along the road are putting their lives at risk as well due to this driver's decision. Pedestrians can also be hit by drivers that are distracted. An example of this is children who are playing in the streets with their toys and friends, or elderly men and women lost their senses could be hit by a car, they wouldn't know what hit them until it already happened.

Some people might use their phones for specific reasons, for example using it as a navigation system to find your way somewhere, or also to talk on the phone if there has been an emergency. In 2010, a total of 355 car accidents happened in the united states, and of those 355, a little less than half of those were deadly accidents that happened due to using cell phones. This is where people need to understand the dangers and listen to what the state has to say about phone usage while driving. It's no good for people to use their phones while operating their vehicles because of the accident and death rate.

In conclusion, by being informed about the types of cell phone usage, the Multiple dangers associated with cell phone usage, and the reasons why people shouldn't use their phones, you can now realize just how important your decision is whenever you decide to make your choice to use your phone while driving. Remember that you are the one that makes the choice, so make the right one by not only looking out for your safety, but also for the safety of others around you.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system, despite the growing calls to replace it with a popular vote for the president of the United States. While I appreciate the arguments against the Electoral College, I believe there are compelling reasons to retain this system. 

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate has a clear majority of electoral votes. This minimizes the likelihood of a disputed outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. By maintaining a margin of victory in multiple states rather than relying solely on the popular vote, the Electoral College offers a more stable and definitive outcome.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents all regions of the country. With the requirement of obtaining trans-regional appeal, candidates must campaign throughout the nation and address the concerns of voters in all states. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated regions or swing states, as they must seek support from a diverse range of voters. The Electoral College guarantees that the president is everyone's president, fostering a sense of national unity.

Thirdly, the Electoral College emphasizes the importance of swing states in the electoral process. By allocating electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates are encouraged to campaign in swing states and effectively address the concerns of their residents. This system prompts candidates to engage with voters in these states more extensively, leading to a better-informed electorate. It ensures that swing states have a say in deciding the outcome of the election and encourages candidates to craft policies that benefit these crucial regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College gives due consideration to the influence and representation of large states. Due to the allocation of electoral votes based on the number of representatives in Congress, large states have a greater impact on the presidential election. This balance of power ensures that the concerns and interests of both small and large states are taken into account, preventing regions with higher populations from dominating the election outcomes.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. With the possibility of a candidate winning a majority of electoral votes without winning the popular vote, run-off elections are unnecessary. This saves significant time, money, and resources that would otherwise be devoted to holding additional elections. The Electoral College streamlines the election process and produces clear winners, avoiding prolonged political uncertainty.

Although some argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states where they know their candidate has no chance of winning, the data from the 2012 election show that voter turnout remains high. Voters are motivated by their desire to express their political preferences and participate in the democratic process, despite their awareness of the system.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system serves as a vital component of our democratic process. It ensures certainty of outcome, provides trans-regional appeal for the president, emphasizes the importance of swing states, gives weight to large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While the electoral system may have flaws, its benefits far outweigh the potential disadvantages. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in the best interest of our nation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. 

Sincerely,

"Everyone has had a time in their life when they needed help. Some people ask for advice to help them with there problem. When seeking advice many people talk to more than one person. Asking more than one person for advice helps people make a good decision by, one giving them a wide variety of options they can choose from, and two by finding people who are more qualified to give advice on your topic than others.

Getting more opinions to choose from lets people find the option they think is right instead of having one option that they have to choose. For an example Generic_Name got a offered his dream job, but Generic_Name already has a job working at Microsoft for a much higher pay. He asks his boss and friends for advice, his boss says he should stay here at Microsoft while his friends say he should go to his dream job. Generic_Name looks at all the advice he got and made a decision to work at his dream job.

By asking many people for advice you might find someone who had a similar experience to your problem. For an example when Generic_Name asked his friends for advice he found out that Generic_Name experienced the same problem in the past. Generic_Name asked what Generic_Name did in that situation and Generic_Name replied with Go to your dream job, I stayed at my job, and I wish would've taken the my dream job. So Generic_Name made the right decision, and left his job to work at his dream job.

Asking lots of people for advice helps people make a good decision by, one giving them an a assortment of options they can choose from, and two by finding people who have experienced a similar problem in the past. Asking multiple people for advice lets the person pick a choice they agree with or like instead of having only one option you have to choose. If you ask enough people you might find someone who experienced a similar problem making them more qualified than other people. Thats why people ask more than one person for advice.",0
"There is no doubt that taking risks is essential to success. This is because taking risks allows people to explore new opportunities and experiences that they would not have otherwise had. Additionally, taking risks also allows people to learn from their mistakes and become better equipped to handle future challenges.

One of the most important things that people can do in order to be successful is to try new things. This is because trying new things allows people to expand their horizons and learn new skills. Additionally, trying new things also allows people to discover new interests and passions. For example, a person who has never tried painting may find that they have a hidden talent for it. Similarly, a person who has never tried cooking may find that they enjoy it more than they thought they would.

Another reason why taking risks is essential to success is that it allows people to learn from their mistakes. This is because people who take risks are more likely to fail than those who do not. However, the important thing is that people learn from their failures. This is because each failure is an opportunity to learn and improve. For example, a person who fails an exam can learn from their mistakes and do better next time. Similarly, a person who makes a bad investment can learn from their mistake and make better decisions in the future.

In conclusion, taking risks is essential to success. This is because taking risks allows people to explore new opportunities and experiences. Additionally, taking risks also allows people to learn from their mistakes and become better equipped to handle future challenges.",1
"In today's world, character is a difficult quality to define. Can it be measured? Is it based on a person's choices, or are we all pre-destined by life's influences? Irrespective of the answer, one cannot deny the role that both “choice” and external “experiences” have in shaping a person's character. 

For example, the choices a person makes with regard to their education and career can have a significant impact on their character. A person who chooses to forego higher education and instead pursue their passions despite it being considered unconventional by society and family, in turn demonstrates their strength of character, courage and conviction. Conversely, a person who chooses to stick to a socially accepted career path, for the purpose of stability, may be said to have a more pragmatic but less adventurous character. 

On the other hand, external experiences can have just as much influence over a person's character. Experiences ranging from loss, hardship, failure, tragedies, or rewards such as successes, successes, accolades, and other forms of achievement, can all leave an indelible impression and shape a person's character and outlook. For instance, overcoming adversity or tragedy can lead to a person's resilience and empathy, two qualities which can profoundly shape a person's character. Similarly, a person exposed to wealth and affluence may exhibit qualities of privilege, enabling them to view the world in a completely different way. 

In conclusion, our character is shaped by both our decisions and our life's influences. While our decisions give us a certain degree of control over our life's path, events and experiences will ultimately shape us, and our reactions to them, into who we are.",1
"The Facial Action Coding System is a very useful tool used to help tell what other peoples emotions are just by their facial expresions. Having this technology can be very helpful in the classrom. It can help define the mixed emotions of a student, how they feel of a topic they are learning, and if a student is telling the truth.

The first reason as to why this technology is useful in the classroom is defineing the mixed emotions of students. In the artical it says The software can even identify mixed emotions (paragraph 4). Being able to identify mixed emotions of a student can be helpful. Sometimes a student may be stressed and upset over something, making it hard for them to concentrate on their work. You can't just let them not work though, but knowing their feelings you may be able to take it more slow paced for them that day. The student may have felt angry and stressed before they came into class, explaining why they got so upset when they couldn't find their homework.

Another reason this would be useful in class is by defining how they feel about a topic in class. In this article it says A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson (paragraph 6). Having this tool say when they are confused is extraemly helpful. It lets the teacher know they may need some extra help, and the computer know to explain things in a different way. When a student becoms bored of what they are doing it becomes hard for them to concentrate, or causes them to want to rush through.

The final reason Facial Action Coding Systems should be in classrooms is because it can help tell when a student is lying. In paragraph 8 of the article it says Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful. This can help a teacher know when an anxious student needs help, but says they don't. Some students may be too anxious to actually speak up when they need help, causing them to lie when a teacher ask them if they do. This also comes in handy when a student has done something and no one knows who it was, like tearing down a poster or putting a tac on the teachers seat.

In conclusion, this technology would be very useful for classrooms to define a students emotions to improve work, help a confused or bored student, and spot out lairs.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage - An Exposé

Reducing car usage is not just a step towards environmental sustainability, but also a solution to various societal issues such as reducing stress and improving living conditions. The experiences of various communities around the world demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage and using alternate means of transportation.

The famous car-free suburb of Vauban, Germany, is a testament to this shift in transportation landscape. Adopting a virtually car-free lifestyle, 70 percent of its families do not own cars, an initiative that has yielded remarkable social and environmental outcomes (Rosenthal, In German Suburb). Residents have reported improved quality of life, lower levels of stress and a more communal living environment marked by an increased pedestrian and bicycle traffic (Rosenthal, In German Suburb). 

This trend is echoed in Bogota, Colombia, where their annual Day Without Cars event has not just reduced traffic congestion, but also improved air quality and promoted a healthier and stress-free lifestyle (Selsky).

However, the environmental aspect cannot be understated. With automobiles being a significant contributor to greenhouse emissions, it presents a clear benefit to limit their usage. Often, car-intense regions can account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States (Rosenthal, In German Suburb). High concentrations of vehicle emissions have even led cities like Paris into imposing temporary driving bans to grapple with near-record levels of pollution (Duffer). 

Paris's successful reduction in smog concentration during their partial driving ban showed that changes in transport behaviors can directly impact air quality (Duffer). Unsurprisingly, it's also becoming clear that there is a discernible shift away from car culture in the United States, suggesting a fundamental change which might significantly reduce carbon emissions and positively impact the environment (Rosenthal, The End of Car Culture).

Emerging technology and systemic changes have made it easier for people to remain connected without the need for as much travel. Telecommuting is becoming more popular due to advancements in internet technology, and carpooling apps have enabled more flexible commuting arrangements (Rosenthal, The End of Car Culture). 

Moreover, the attitude towards cars is changing among younger generations. A significant decrease in car ownership and interest in obtaining a driver’s license among young people shows a shift away from a previously car-centric mentality (Rosenthal, The End of Car Culture).

Altogether, these case studies and trends provide strong evidence for the benefits of limiting car usage. The societal changes translate not just to environmental sustainability, but also influence the quality of life, health, and societal values in ways that could lead to a more desirable future. In the face of these advantages, it's clear that transitioning to more car-free or car-limiting practices could yield extensive benefits for communities worldwide.",1
"Should drivers be able to have access to their phone while driving or should it be illegal?

Drivers should not be able to drive with phones because of the outcomes that could happen. A lot of drivers like to text and talk on the phone, but mostly text when they are at a red light or even text while they are in motion driving. Driving with phones in hands can cause accidents like crashing into another car, running off the road causing damage to the driver and any other passengers in the car if any and injuring other drivers on the road and even causing death upon yourself. Some people are addicted to their phones and want to be on their phone every time they get a chance.

Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media post take eyes and brains off the task of driving.  Usage of hands free device while driving, Hands free is not risk free. The use of technology is improving more and more each day. We went from rotary phones, to beepers, to touchscreens.

We've gotten so improved that we can use hands-free devices to still carry out our conversations. It's not a bad thing, no its how and when we use such device. If using such device affects us and there around us in a negative wa, than we must make a change. The life you save could be your very own. Despite the enormous benefit derived from the use of hands-free devices, there is also some detrimental aspect of such use. The brain quickly toggles between task but cannot perform two things that requires cognitive thinking at the same time while driving, the activities in the area of the brain that processes moving images decreases by up to ? when listening to and talking on a device.

For example, walking and chewing gum involve a thinking and a nonthiking task. Help make the world a safer place; eyes on the road, hands on the wheel, mind on driving. One call thats all it takes to change your life or the life of another in an accident. Hands free, is risk free.",0

"In recent years, the popularity of electric skateboards has skyrocketed. As technology advances, more and more people are turning to these vehicles as a way to get around quickly and efficiently. Whether you’re looking for an eco-friendly mode of transportation or just something fun and convenient, electric skateboards are sure to fit the bill. When it comes to choosing an electric skateboard, there is plenty of variety available in terms of size, type, battery life and speed capabilities. If you’re a beginner looking for your first board, it’s best to start with smaller boards that can accommodate lighter loads and have less acceleration power than larger models. Larger boards will give experienced riders greater control over their rides but require additional practice before taking on higher speeds safely. In addition to size considerations, shoppers should also be aware that some boards feature different types of motors - brushless versus brushed - which can affect how much torque (and therefore speed) they offer when accelerating from a stop or climbing hills. Electric skateboards are powered by lithium ion batteries which provide great range between charges depending on the model chosen along with how heavily used it is during each ride; most come standard with long lasting 10ah/12 ah+ rechargeable batteries offering up to 20 miles per charge without sacrificing performance or having any noticeable decrease in power output due to age or wear & tear from use over time . Battery life isn't necessarily static however; many newer models boast swappable batteries so riders don't have pause their adventures while waiting for recharging cycles complete!. Safety should always be paramount when operating motorized vehicles such as electric skateboards so make sure you're wearing all necessary protective gear like helmets and pads before setting off on your journey! Additionally , familiarize yourself with local laws regarding e-skateboarding usage as restrictions may vary based upon geographical area; knowing ahead time helps ensure smooth sailing throughout entire trip !. . Overall , electric skate",1
"In my experiences be disagree with this statement because everybody have different personalitie, The person have one day bad, and the persona change.

however the first impressions can be change, Everybody have different personalitie becuase the people make much caracterist tha see different for example a person can have much cualidad that other people don't have, Also do not always other person have that be yourself.

The person have one day bad becuase something the people in the school can have stressful for example when have so much homework during in class , also the person in the job is possible that have problem for example the other person can cause conflict and making is mad.

However the people change becuase they can have a good expression of a manner that your attitude can be esplendi,

for example no every person have bad comportamient.

In conclusion every one can be different personalitie and not is imposible change our impressions have that be we yourself.",0
"Do you believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens? Well you are incorrect, with scietific fact the face was not from aliens and was always on Mars. Man people believe that the face on mars was created by aliens because of the theroist but NASA wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars but there is no sign of one.

Scientist believe the face wwas just another Martian mesa, which was common enough around Cydonia.

Scientist also took photos called viking photos of this face in 1976, 1998, and 2001. With new high-resolution images and 3D altiemetryfrom NASA's mars global survey spacecrafts reveal the face on mars for what it really is a mesa.

People at NASA wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars but facts show that the face was just part of the Earth's geography. For instance people believe that the aliens built the face to show they are living, but one camera team took a picture ten times sharper then the original viking photos. MAny people were waiting for the results and the results showed that it was just a natural land form and not an alien creature after all.

Not everyone was satisfied with the photos, this was because the face was located in a place where it was a cloudy time of year. people believed that under the wispy clouds they would find alien life. so on a cloudless sumer day they took another photo to show there was no sign of alien life. After taking the photo and observing it evidence showed that there was no sign of alien life.

Some of NASA would try to believe that there must be alien life on Mars but they could not find evidence to prove their point. In conclusion scientists proved that the face was just a landmark on Mars. They also proved that there is no sign of alien life on Mars.",0
"This prompt is about some people that need help to make their own decisions or need someone to told what they need to do even in their personal life.

The question say  should people make their omn decesions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? some people they will said that is better if someone as came and make there decisions in everything so, they don't need to worry about anything.

There are another person that think that is way to much because how someone that they don't know is gonna make their decisions and also the dicisions of their life.

This is a big topical because like I said before so many people can desagree with this but there are other that are agree with this,in my opinion I'm desagree with this becuause is my life and I need to leard how to deal with it. Even if my life is the worse one I going to take care of all my decesions sometimes we can ask at someone for a opinion maybe, because the person is more older then me but is only a opinion you're not gaving authorities at all at the person to go and make your decisions and then take care of all your stuff.

In my conclusion is better if you take care of your on stuff doesn't matter how hard that it, is your life and you are the only one that knows how to deal with everything that you have done so, this is my last decision people should make their own decisions.",0
"In all honesty, if it were up to me, I would keep the Electoral College. Because imagaine what a catastrophe it would be if we did not have the Electoral College, how would they count the votes. Anybodyvoted on who you wanted to win it go can cheat the number of votes to change the president they are voting for. With the Electoral College you can't do that because,  once you voted who you want to win, it get sent out tothe electors. Who from that point on count how many voted for both of them and decide a winner.

Now it is possible for somebody to secretly change the names that way but it is a higher stake, or risk to take not having the Electoral College. Also, it is possible for worker of the Electoral College to make a mistake in countung the counting the votes and to cause a big confussion in the votes but that is very highly impossible, if not impossible.

If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place?

The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachrosim, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruledbydeclaring the candidate who receives the most popular vote the winner. Not only that, but a disputeover the outcome of an Elecotral College voteis possible-it happened in 2000-but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.

Their are five reasons to retain, or keep the Electoral College. First, it's a certainty of outcome, the winner is everybodys president, it swings states, not only does ig work for little states, but for big ones too, and you can avoid run-off elections.

So those are my reasons why we should keep the Electoral College, we should not overlook the goods that the Electoral College does to our nation just because of two little bad that can be repaired.",0
"Intergenerational educational programs are a great way for both young and old students to come together and learn from one another while also helping each other. This type of program is important in order to bridge the gap between the generations, build understanding, and foster collaboration. It also gives children and teens the opportunity to learn from experienced adults, and adults the chance to stay informed on technological developments. Moreover, these programs give students a platform to understand the different perspectives, beliefs, and values of the older and younger generations. 

This type of program should benefit students from primary school to university level. Teacher facilitated co-learning settings can help kids build connections that will help them succeed and grow in the long-term. University students can gain valuable insight and access resources from experienced colleagues as mentors. Everyone benefits and leaves with a more nuanced understanding of the world, and how generations work together to create and learn.",1
"A with less cars would be a better world because people would not emit as much harmful gas to distroy the o-zone. the two reasons the world would be better without cars are people would walk more which means that people would get more exersice. the other reason that it would be better to have a world with less cars is people would spend less money on cars and gas.

The first reason it would be a better world without cars is that people would walk more and the people that walk would get more exersice and be healthier. the other reason it would be better to walk is that people that have anger and stress problems would not have to be stuck in traffic and would not get angry over people doing stuff to them wen they'er in traffic and people who get stressed would not have to worry about people running into them or people cutting them off. the last reason that it would be better for people to walk is that people would be healthier because they would not have all the fumes from the cars in thier face and would not be inhaling it so they not have lung problems in the futer because they were breathing the fumes.

The second reason it would be better world with out cars is that people would spend less money on gas which means that people wuld have more money for other things. also if people didn't spend money on gas and cars is people would not have to make car payments so they wouldn't stress about not having enough money to pay the car payment or the car getting reposesed. the last reason it would be better to not spend money on cars and gas is if people didn't spend money on that stuff they would be able to spend money on running shoes so when they walk to work or whereever they are going they can wear the proper shoes.

In a world with less cars people would be so much better off because of all the things they don't have to spend money on. also the world would not get as damaged because of all the things cars emit.",0
"The new technology it was created by, what does it do,is it a good thing. The software is the latest innovation fro professer. Thomas Huang,of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the Universiy of illinos,working in collaboation with Professer Nicu. Sebe of the University. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better way for human and coumputers to communicate.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the the model must move like humans muscels. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of pyschologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman,creator of FACS.

They want to use this technology to help in a classroom to see when a kid is confused or boerd to help them to plan lesson that the kids will learn from. Eckman has claaified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles

I think we should use the new technology in classroom because I think I will become dectration to kids because they will want to play with it to see her they feel. This type of technology should be use for treapist to help read patient when they are talk about their life so the treapist know how they felt about that part in there life.",0
"Have you ever needed advise on something in your life? You may have had a problem and needed input. Or you may have had to make a decision and needed help on deciding what to do. It helps when you talk to more people about your situation. When you need advise it is best to talk to multiple people because different people have different experiences, different people can help you see the different points of view, and hearing more than one solution can help you understand your situation more.

The first reason it is best to talk to multiple people when you need advise is because different people have different experiences. People tend to look at problems based on the experiences they have gone through and if one person has gone through something similar than they can tell you what they did. For example when someone asked me a difficult question I asked my two of my friends for advise. One of the had never been in a situation like that and did not know what to say. My other friend had been in a similar situation and she knew exactly what to say. Someone who has been through a lot in life can give advise based on everything they have been through. The different experiences will give you different options to look at. The more options you have the more likely you are to make a good decision.

The second reason it best to talk to multiple people when you need advise is because different people can help you see different points of view. When you talk to just one person about your issue, especially if that one person has the same opinion as you, than it can be hard to see the different angles. If you talk to lots of people they can point out different things that you may have not thought about. When I wanted to end a relationship I talked to a lot of different people about the best way to do it and they made it easier for me to see the point of view of the other person. Seeing an issue from different points of view will make you realize more about the issue and make a better choice. Also seeing a different point of view will help you make a choice that benefits all the people the problem is effecting.

The last reason it is best to talk to multiple people when you need advise is because hearing more than one solution can help you understand the situation more. Sometimes you don't fully understand everything your going through and hearing lots of peoples input can help you understand everything better. For example if your talking to someone about what you going through and they tell you how they see it than you would understand everything more. The more advise you get the more people are talking about the problem and the more you understand everything. It is important to understand everything because if you don't then you may make the wrong decision.

In life you will have problems that you need advise on. One person does not know everything so they can not give all the answers. When lots of people give you advise it helps you a lot more. The more input you get the more likely you are to make an informed decision. If you need help it is better to ask multiple people about it because people have been through different things, people can help you see the different angles of the problem, and the more advise you get the more you understand your problem.",0

"Most people don't realize the importance of bees in our everyday lives. Bees are essential for pollinating plants and flowers, which helps produce the food that we eat and also encourages a vibrant and diverse ecosystem. Unfortunately, due to habitat destruction, pesticide use, climate change, as well as other factors such as urbanization and disease outbreaks; bee populations have been declining rapidly around the world. The decline in bee numbers is concerning because it affects not only our environment but also us directly. Pollinators are responsible for one-third of all crop production worldwide so without them there would be an enormous decrease in available food sources globally. Additionally, honeybees provide a host of other benefits such as producing honey or wax used for candles or cosmetics. Therefore if we want to ensure our continued access to these resources it’s important that we make efforts to protect them now before their numbers dwindle even further than they already have. There are numerous ways we can help preserve bee populations from supporting organizations who focus on protecting bees through research projects or through donations; avoiding pesticides when possible; planting wildflowers rich with nectar; building shelters like nesting boxes for solitary bees; advocating policy changes at local levels to create more suitable habitats for bees and doing our best to educate ourselves about their plight so that others will become aware too!. Ultimately preserving bee populations has many advantages both short term and long term so taking action towards this goal is vital if we want future generations to continue enjoying the incredible benefits provided by these amazing creatures!",1
"From the dawn of civilization to the present day, mathematics has been an integral part of human life. Mathematics is a powerful tool that can help us make sense of our universe and everything in it, enabling us to create new technologies, solve problems more efficiently and understand more complex concepts. From counting objects to solving equations, mathematics provides structure and order in our lives. The history of mathematics dates back thousands of years where early civilizations invented counting systems, calendars and geometric shapes in order to measure land for farming or predict astronomical events like solar eclipses. In ancient Egypt math was used extensively for engineering projects such as building pyramids while Babylonian mathematicians developed algebraic methods using base 60 notation which formed the basis for timekeeping today (like minutes in one hour). Ancient Greece saw major strides made by Greek philosophers through their logical reasoning (Euclid’s Elements) who proved many fundamental mathematical theories which are still being studied today. . In modern times we use math everyday from calculating distances when travelling with GPS navigation systems to understanding financial markets with mathematical models or planning a project budget. It also forms an important component within many scientific fields such as physics where formulas are used for calculations about forces acting on different particles or within chemistry where various equations show how elements combine together form compounds or break down into different elements again (law of conservation mass). A deeper knowledge of maths also allows us get insights into nature itself within fields like quantum mechanics which explore very small scales at subatomic levels or studying large structures like galaxies by looking at orbital patterns around them using calculus/algebraic methods etc…. . Overall there is no denying that math plays a vital role throughout our world whether its helping build bridges over rivers safely without collapsing due to stress on certain points following Newton’s 3 laws motion OR predicting weather patterns better using computer simulations based on atmospheric pressure data collected over time - The possibilities are only limited by our own imagination!",1
"The power of music has been a source of fascination since ancient times. Its ability to evoke strong emotion, create inspiration and even heal physical ailments is well-documented. There are many genres, forms, and styles of music that have come into existence over the centuries but arguably none has had such an enduring impact on humanity as classical music. Though it may not be the most accessible or mainstream genre in today's modern world, classical music still holds a timeless quality that speaks to its importance throughout history. Classical music originated from Western Europe during the medieval period and flourished up until the 19th century when romanticism was at its peak. It was composed for various instruments including strings (violin/cello/double bass), woodwinds (oboe/flute/clarinet) brass (trumpet/french horn) percussion (timpani) as well as keyboard instruments like piano or organ. Classical pieces often featured multiple movements with different tempos & moods which added complexity to each piece while also allowing musicians to express their individual creativity through improvisation or embellishments. Some famous examples include Beethoven’s 9th Symphony & Mozart’s Requiem Mass which are considered masterpieces in this genre due to their intricate composition & emotional depth they evoke in listeners. Classical Music has been celebrated for its calming effect on the soul by providing a sense of peace within tumultuous times; it can be used therapeutically too by helping those struggling with mental health issues such as anxiety or depression gain relaxation and clarity through listening sessions focused solely on this form of music . Additionally ,studies have found evidence linking increased cognitive abilities with regular exposure to classical styles; this could benefit students studying for exams among other academic pursuits looking for improved concentration levels . Furthermore it is believed that certain complex musical pieces help stimulate activity within parts of our brain responsible for critical thinking thus potentially aiding memory retention -allowing us access more information quickly plus store data",1
"As an AI language model, I do not have a political identity, but I believe that it is not always possible to identify a person's politics within a short time of meeting him or her. While it is true that some aspects of a person's life, such as their clothing, friends, and manner of speaking, may give some clues about their political beliefs, it is not always accurate. People are complex beings, and their political beliefs are shaped by a variety of factors, including their upbringing, education, and life experiences.

For example, a person who is dressed in conservative clothing may not necessarily be a conservative. They may be dressing conservatively for a job interview or a family event. Similarly, a person who speaks in a certain way may not necessarily align with a specific political ideology. There are people who can fluently switch between different registers and language styles depending on the situation.

Furthermore, friends and social circles can be a poor indicator of one's political beliefs. People often befriend others who are different from them, and it is possible for someone to have friends with differing political beliefs. Additionally, political views are often kept private within friendships to avoid conflict, so it may not be possible to deduce a person's political beliefs based on their friends.

Even what a person eats has no direct relation to their political beliefs. People choose to eat certain foods for a variety of reasons, including personal taste, health, and cultural background. One's political beliefs do not necessarily dictate their dietary choices.

In contrast, it is possible for someone's political beliefs to be expressed through their actions and behaviors. For example, a person who actively volunteers for a political campaign or attends rallies and protests is likely to have strong political beliefs. Similarly, a person who regularly engages in political discussions and debates may reveal their political views through their arguments and positions.

In conclusion, while some aspects of a person's life may give some indication of their political beliefs, it is not always accurate to make assumptions based on them. People are complex beings, and their political beliefs are shaped by a variety of factors. It is important to engage in conversations and discussions with others to gain a better understanding of their political beliefs and perspectives.",1
"In life, it is important to set your own character in order to find success. Success is not something that is handed to you, but something that you have to work hard for. By setting your own character, you are creating a path toward achieving your goals. Your character is the foundation for how you will approach life, its challenges, and even success. 

Your character is the set of values that you live by, decisions you make, and your attitude towards life. It is important to have a strong moral compass and not be swayed by peer pressure or popular trends. The power of your character lies in the strength of your convictions and the balance that it brings to your life. When you live with strong values, you are able to make the right decisions in life, no matter how difficult or unpopular they may be. 

Having a strong character is also essential to having a successful career and achieving your goals. If you have clear goals and a strong will to work hard, you can achieve a lot. You have to stay focused and motivated to be successful; setting your own character helps you do just that by emphasizing qualities such as grit, determination, and resilience. 

Setting your own character is critical to find success. It serves as a guiding light to make the right decisions and to stay focused on the goal at hand. Having a strong character is the foundation for success, so make sure to take the time to set yours.",1
"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology in classrooms to read students' emotional expressions is questionable and raises several concerns. While identifying students' emotions could potentially help teachers understand how lessons are impacting their students, it may infringe on students' privacy and autonomy. 

FACS aims to analyze subtle facial muscle movements to decipher complex emotions. However, emotions are highly personal and context-dependent. A student may appear anxious while focusing intently, yet the cause of their expression could be extraneous to the lesson. Constant monitoring of emotional cues may undermine the student-teacher relationship and create performance pressure. Students deserve a stress-free learning environment without feeling surveilled. 

Additionally, emotional decoding often involves subjective interpretation. Different people can perceive the same expression differently based on their background and perspective. Software is not sophisticated enough to account for individual contexts and nuances. Misreading a student's emotional state risks making assumptions about their engagement or needs. This could negatively impact how a teacher structures lessons or interacts with that student. 

Rather than trying to mine emotional data, teachers would be better served focusing on direct communication with students. Asking for feedback respects student autonomy and agency over their own learning experience. It also builds trust between educator and learner. If a teacher notices disengagement, a respectful conversation is likely to provide far more useful insights than any technology ever could. 

In conclusion, while the intent of FACS may be to help teachers support students, its application in classrooms raises valid privacy and efficacy concerns that outweigh potential benefits. Direct engagement and open dialogue between students and teachers is a more effective approach for understanding students' needs than distant emotional surveillance. Students' well-being and rights should take priority over experimental technologies in the classroom.",1
"We have been using cell phones on a daily basis that we've gotten used to it, but people think they will be able to drive normally even if they are using their phone. Well, they are wrong, using phones while driving lead too many people in car accidents, killing other people, and you'll be fined much money, even if you don't crash or anything like that. People shouldn't be allowed to drive and use their phone for theirs and others safety.

While many people think using their phone while driving isn't hard, but there have been tons of accidents because of people using their phones while driving. In 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers. This shows that car accidents are now a more commonly known way people die. Usually, a car accident only involves 3 or 4 people are involved so if the number of killed and injured are so high then that shows that the number of car accidents is also high. That shows that people can't be on their phones and driving.

Driving and usage of phones do cause accidents; it could also cause the driver to run over people. A staggering 37,461 people were killed on US roads in 2016, an increase of 5.6 percent from the previous year, according to just-released statistics from the US National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration. All of these accidents have occurred ever since phones came out and that's because we all think we are able to multitask. When it comes to driving we need all of our attention on it and not anywhere else because then we don't see people crossing the road. All these deaths are being cause by the fact that we can't leave our phones until we get to our destination.

After many years of distracted driving the US is finally doing something about it, they instated a law that if you are caught using your phone or it's just in your lap you'll be fined. Motorists operating commercial vehicles who violated the distracted driving law are subject to a civil penalty of up to $2,750. That may seem too much money for a small thing, but it could save many lives including your own. Using your phone won't only get you fined, it'll also get your license suspended, which you won't be getting back for a long time. With just one time using your phone while driving will take your money, which you worked hard to get.

In conclusion, people should learn that using their phone while driving will only lead to bad things. Even if it's the first time you've used your phone while driving, you'll get the same consequences as if it was done in the past.

"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities alike. This is evident in the experiences of communities around the world, as described in the passages provided. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address critical issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as create safer and more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in areas where car usage is high. For example, in Europe, cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50 percent (Passage 5). By reducing car usage, we can help combat climate change and work towards a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. In cities like Paris, smog can become a major problem, causing health issues for residents. To combat this, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to reduce smog levels, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion (Passage 10, 14). Similar efforts have been made in other cities, such as Bogota, where car-free days have been implemented to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation (Passage 21).

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on public health and safety. In communities where cars are restricted, residents are more likely to engage in physical activities like walking or biking, leading to improved fitness levels and overall well-being. Moreover, by reducing car usage, we can create safer streets with fewer accidents and fatalities. In Vauban, Germany, where car usage is limited, residents report feeling happier and less tense without the constant presence of cars (Passage 3).

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for more efficient and compact community planning. By reducing the need for parking spaces, communities can allocate more land for other purposes, such as parks or public transportation infrastructure. In Vauban, stores are placed a walk away on a main street, providing residents with easy access to necessities without the need for a car (Passage 6). This type of planning can create more vibrant and accessible communities that prioritize pedestrians and public transportation over cars.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improve public health and safety, and create more efficient and sustainable communities. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the positive impacts of limiting car usage and highlight the potential for change in our own communities. It is clear that by prioritizing alternative transportation methods and adopting smart planning strategies, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are several key reasons for this. 

First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving is distracting and prevents the driver from paying full attention to the road. Talking, texting, or any other cell phone activity takes the driver's eyes and minds off of their primary task - safely operating the vehicle. This greatly increases the risk of accidents. Studies have shown that cell phone use while driving can reduce situational awareness and reaction time as much as having a blood alcohol content at the legal limit of intoxication. 

Secondly, cell phone use presents a significant danger to others on the road, not just the user. Any lapse in attention or delayed reaction time could result in an accident that harms or even kills innocent people. Driving is not a solitary act - the actions of one driver can impact public safety. When we drive, we have a responsibility to minimize risks and protect others. Using a cell phone violates that responsibility.

Lastly, banning cell phone use except for emergencies would set a clear standard and norm that supports road safety. Partial bans or limitations are confusing and difficult for law enforcement to consistently apply. An outright ban sends a strong message that cell phones do not belong in the hands of drivers unless in emergencies or using hands-free options. Clear, straightforward laws are easier for all drivers to understand and obey. 

In summary, cell phone use poses unacceptable risks to driver and public safety. The costs of even brief distractions are too high when lives are at stake on the road. For this reason, drivers should not be permitted to use cell phones in any capacity except in emergency situations. Public safety and responsible driving must take priority over any non-emergency cell phone activity behind the wheel.",1
"Loneliness is an often overlooked emotion that can have a lasting and profound effect on the lives of those who suffer from it. Loneliness can affect everyone, regardless of age, gender or socioeconomic status. It is particularly detrimental to children and young adults as they develop emotionally. In fact, loneliness has been linked to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and addiction. Many people feel lonely for different reasons; some may struggle with social anxiety or shyness which makes it difficult to make connections with others, while others are in need of companionship that either cannot be found or maintained due to various circumstances such as family illness or geographic distance from loved ones. Additionally, certain traumatic life events like divorce or the death of a loved one can contribute greatly to feelings of loneliness. It’s important for people suffering from loneliness not to despair but instead take proactive steps towards alleviating those feelings by seeking out supportive relationships like friends and family members who offer emotional support during times when you need it most. Additionally engaging in hobbies and activities with other individuals (such as clubs/teams) allows us to meet new people while also establishing common ground between them which helps create meaningful friendships over time. Taking care of our physical health through exercise regimes also assists in managing stress levels which contributes directly towards decreased levels of loneliness since physical activity acts as an outlet for emotions we don’t want bottled up inside ourselves any longer than necessary - whether joyous elation at feeling contented after completing a goal set forth beforehand OR heart-wrenching sorrow felt after enduring tragic loss that seemed unbearable once before yet now appears slightly easier thanks solely due much needed endorphins created only through intense bouts perspiration & determination!. . . . In conclusion , recognizing & addressing the issue surrounding this powerful emotion—loneliness—is essential for overall well being & emotional growth no matter where along life's journey we currently reside . By understanding our personal needs , building upon existing interpersonal relationships ,",1
"Dear Senator, The topic of the Electoral college is a hot one, and the idea of whether of not to adjust it is controversial. Many citizen disagree with the process while many are in favor. What should we do? We should change the Electoral College. The voting is based more on quantity instead of quality, and the voting is not coming from the citizen's directly, making the risk of an unfaithful candidate too high and the actual voting less popular and more electoral. When one stateor even one person could change the whole ball game that is the Presidential Election, then what does that mean for our democracy?

While many will argue that it is a fair way to vote, the Electoral College has many flaws. First off, the candidates are focusing on more power and higher tallying states to get them through the election than everyone as a whole. For example, if you were a presidential candidate would you spend more time trying to sway California, with its whopping 55 electoral votes, or montana, with a teeny tiny 3 electoral votes? The candidates are not being considerate of ALL the American citizens, but instead the ones that they think will lead them to victory. This is not what the election is all about. The election is more focused on the popular vote of few states with many inhabitants than it is on many states with few citizens.

Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. As stated in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong . Being that this true, why do we call it the Presidential Election instead of the Electors Election? Electors claim to be faithful to their candidates but sometimes this is not the case. If a member of the group is unfaithful to their candidate, it could unsettle the whole election, meaning that the United States as a whole would have to pay for the electors actions. This is not how voting was meant to be. Our slogan is We the People, not We the Electors. Now, I know what you're thinking, Why would we change this system? It is already established and has worked for many years. In order to move forward as a nation we as a whole need to make changes sometimes. Just think what it would be like today if segregationan established rule and law was not questioned. Or even if the settlers of the United States had not questioned our former mother country and broke away. We would not even be the establishment we are today if we did not question established rules or traditions. The Electoral College is nothing more than a system that needs to be reevaluated, putting the popularity if the candidate in clearer perspective.

To recap, The Electoral College does not include the popularity of the candidates over official influences. The states are not being counted equally and electors control the electon overall. In order to have a more successful government and a more included population, the Electoral College simply needs to be reevaluated and changed to meet the popularity standards of our country if we are to ever advance.",0
"Asking more than one person for advise can be goo because, everyone has different thoughts and experiences so different answers from different people will help with whatever you need advice about.

Even if the person dose not completely agree with you.

Firstly, When making a choice you have to pick between two different things.

Most of the time its a rather hard decision. picking one thing is never easy so as a human you ask someone else for there opinion or advice.

They may have a different opinion or maybe even the same but you may not completely trust just one opinion so you ask another person what they think.

After, asking another person for their advice which may help you to come to a conclusion an make a decision based off of what you were told and what you think is best.

Asking for advise could be for better of for worse, maybe even something as simple as what shirt matches your pants the best. Weither the problem is big or small you can always ask for advise.

Second, Look at it like this, lets say you ask your mom for advise about a boy an then you ask your best friend.

Obviously their both going to think different things you mom isnt going to want to see you get your heart broken and your best friend is going to want whats best for you. They both might think the same thing which would help you realize that maybe that boy isnt to good for you.

If their opinions are different then you might want to ask third person to break the tie or just take the first advise you get and move on.

Lastly, Some people may prefer their own opinion or advise in some situations.

Not all decisions can be made alone someone needs help at some point. They may think they make better choices when they make them alone also not all problems need help and can be solved alone. Then again, some people do work better when they are alone. Asking multiple opinions can be helpful or just plain out pointless. If the person you ask for advise thinks the same thing as you then it was point less to even bring them into something that couldÃÂ´ve been solved your self.

Asking another person may just bring up your confidence because they have the same opinion as you do, if they disagree it could make you think, ÃÂ¨am I making the right decisionÃÂ¨.

In conclusion, Making a decision can be hard and confusing an you may not always need advise. Asking another person for advice that you just cant make a decision on can benefit yo or be pointless and help at the same time.

Making confidence go up that you made the right decision or someone dis agreeing with you either way it helps you come to a decision easier.",0
"The Face on Mars is a very talked about landform on Mars and it brings many conspiract theories with it. NASA stresses that it is a natural landform called a mesa while other beleive it was made by aliens.

NASA says it is a natural landform becuase it is in the Cydonia region of Mars which has many landform like the Face. They have also done extensive research on the Face and took many photos over the years. Their latest photo was in 2001. This photo was evidence that it had to be natural because each pixel shoed only 1.56 meters which meant that if there was any strage markings or buildings they would easily be seen. NASA also states the the Face on Mars is very similar to mesas on earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, says  It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho....

With the research NASA has done and with all the photo evidence it is easy to say that the Face on Mars is indeed a natural landform. Everything NASA has done to prove this eliminates any speculation or doubt brought up by the public. The Face on Mars is just another reason to appreciate the beauty of the universe and the hard work of NASA.",0
"It is true that providing clear direction is often beneficial to college students. However, the notion that colleges should eliminate as many choices as possible in order to offer students clear direction is misguided and should not be implemented. Rather than eliminating choices, colleges should focus on providing students with the tools and guidance they need in order to make informed decisions and develop as individuals.

When making decisions, it is important for college students to be able to weigh the pros and cons of each option. If colleges eliminate as many choices as possible, students will not have the opportunity to practice this important skill. In addition, by limiting choices, colleges would be limiting the potential for students to explore new experiences and develop their abilities. Every choice a student makes is an opportunity to learn and grow, and eliminating those choices would remove that possibility. 

Furthermore, by limiting choices, colleges would be stifling creativity and innovation. When presented with an abundance of options, students are more likely to think outside the box and come up with solutions that may not have been previously considered. This type of innovative thinking is essential for problem solving, and, in turn, for professional success. 

Rather than eliminating choices, colleges should focus on providing students with the tools and guidance they need in order to make informed decisions. Colleges should offer resources such as counseling services, workshops, and mentorships, to help students evaluate the choices before them and make decisions that are right for them. By providing students with the tools to make informed decisions, colleges can ensure that students are equipped to make the best decision for themselves and their future.

In conclusion, while providing clear direction is beneficial to college students, colleges should not eliminate as many choices as possible in order to offer this direction. Instead, they should focus on providing students with the tools they need to make informed decisions and explore new experiences. Doing so will give students the opportunity to develop as individuals and become more confident decision-makers.",1
"In the modern era, the world is moving towards electronic media, and the use of paper is becoming less common. The same goes for holiday greetings, where environmentalists suggest using electronic cards instead of paper cards. However, some people believe that electronic cards do not have the same flavor as paper cards and lack the same function. In my view, I partially agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will explain why.

Firstly, paper cards have a unique flavor that electronic cards cannot match. The texture of the paper, the smell of ink, and the colorful design of the card create a unique experience that electronic cards cannot replicate. People can touch and feel the paper card, which gives a personal touch to the greeting. Moreover, paper cards can be stored as a memory, and people can revisit them after years, which is not possible with electronic cards.

On the other hand, electronic cards have their own advantages. They are easily accessible, and people can send them to a large number of people with just a few clicks. This makes them more practical for people who have a busy schedule and cannot visit everyone personally. Additionally, electronic cards are more eco-friendly than paper cards, as they do not require trees to be cut down and do not contribute to landfills.

However, electronic cards lack the same function as paper cards. Paper cards can be used as decorations, and people can hang them on walls or place them on shelves. They can also be used as bookmarks or notes, which is not possible with electronic cards. Moreover, paper cards can be personalized with handwritten messages, which gives a more intimate touch to the greeting.

In conclusion, both paper and electronic cards have their own advantages and disadvantages. While electronic cards are more practical and eco-friendly, paper cards have a unique flavor and function that electronic cards cannot match. Therefore, it is up to individuals to decide which type of card they prefer based on their personal preferences and values.",1
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Cars have long been a symbol of suburban life. However, limiting car usage in favor of alternative transportation methods can have numerous advantages. The passage set provides several examples of these advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to public transportation. By examining these benefits, it becomes clear that limiting car usage can lead to a more sustainable and healthier environment.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in the United States, the figure can be as high as 50 percent. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, biking, and public transportation, these emissions can be significantly reduced. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and the preservation of our planet.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. The passage on Paris's ban on driving due to smog highlights the detrimental effects of car emissions on air quality. The article states that Paris experienced near-record pollution, which rivaled that of heavily polluted cities like Beijing. By limiting car usage, particularly in highly populated areas, the concentration of harmful pollutants in the air can be reduced, leading to cleaner and healthier environments for citizens.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to increased accessibility to public transportation. The passage about Vauban, Germany, mentions that the community is car-free, with only limited parking spaces available at the edge of the development. As a result, a significant percentage of Vauban's residents do not own cars, and the community is more accessible to public transportation. By adopting this approach in other suburbs, more people will have access to efficient and sustainable modes of transportation. This can reduce congestion on the roads and provide viable alternatives to driving.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and increasing accessibility to public transportation, communities can work towards a greener and more sustainable future. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and promote alternative transportation methods as a means to achieve these advantages.",1
"The practice of trepanation, the surgical drilling of holes into the human skull, is an ancient form of medical intervention that has been practiced for thousands of years. This procedure was first used in Neolithic times and evidence suggests it has been performed on humans since then throughout much of Europe, Asia and South America. The motivations for performing this surgery vary greatly from region to region. In some cultures, trepanation was seen as a way to release evil spirits or cure illnesses caused by supernatural forces while in others it may have been done to alleviate physical symptoms such as headaches or even mental issues like depression. In some cases it is believed that the hole drilled released pressure on the brain which could be caused by a variety of ailments including stroke or injury; however there is no scientific basis for this belief today. . Despite its lack of scientific validity, many people believe that trepanning can help with certain emotional and psychological issues and therefore continue practicing it today—mainly using modern tools instead of ancient methods such as stone drills or animal bones. During these procedures anaesthesia isn't always used so potential risks associated with bleeding and infection do exist although practitioners claim those are rare due to their experience with the technique. The majority view among modern doctors is that trepanning carries too many risks compared to any potential benefits but if done carefully under supervised conditions results from trepanned individuals indicate improved moods, reduced anxiety levels and other positive outcomes suggesting there may be something more than superstition behind this controversial practice after all; we just don't know enough about why it works yet!",1

"This Face from Mars is just a natural landform. It can't be created from aliens because aliens do not exist. Also, no one has ever seen a real alien before. They could just be making this up for the entertainment and attention. The Face even looks like a human head. I can prove that by the evidence that NASA has.

The Face even resembles a human head. There's shadowing that makes the Face a natural landform. The shadowing gives illusion of eyes, a nose, and mouth. According to paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of web surfers all over the world were waiting for the image to appear on a JPL web site. It revealed that it was a natural landform and not an alien monument.

It may look like the Face was created by aliens but it is really doubtful. There is not that much evidence that it could've been an alien's marking. Perhaps, it could've been the wind and water making rocks collide to form the Face. There could be missing evidence that NASA might've not catched, but NASA does have evidence that can say it was just a natural landform.",0
"What if your teacher could actually know exactly how you are feeling? I think the use of a new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be very valuable, due to the fact that they could give a teacher more insight on how their students really feel, and even let a student know that they are not the only ones who might feel the way they do. Finally, this technology could help modify lessons and increase student productivity.

This technology could give teachers more insight on how their students really feel due to its extroardinary system. Paragraph 3 talks about how the process begins, cause the big question here might be,  Can you actually calculate emotions- like math problems? Or, How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? The text states how the process includes constructing a 3-D computer model of the face and how with the work of physhologists the emotions can be defined. If this system is as valauable as the text states it to be, then letting a teacher know how the students actually feel could be effecient to the the teacher, because they can try to comprehend the students and show their support to them as well. Nowadays teachers seem to think that they are the only ones with problems which is not at all true.

This technology could also be of value if it even lead to letting classmates know that they are not the only ones dealing with the emotions that they have, in fact many others could feel the exact way. Sometimes students feel that they are dealing with emotions alone. This technology could change that. Letting other students know of how a class mate is feeling could be very helpful. Not obly that, but knowing or seeing that others are happy could bring a smile to your face. Paragraph 6 states, The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it just shows how much this computer can do. The capability of this technology just sounds like it can change lives.

The classroom computer could also help to modify a lesson if a student is bored. The text states,  A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This could improve productivity.

The Facial Action Coding System could be very valuable in a classroom, due to such a great software it uses. This sytem could impact not only a classroom, but lives.",0
"Chossing our President so be done by popular vote and the electoral college. This will allow citizens who are involed with the congress and who are not involeve to have equal say on who is president. So people might say that getting rid of the electoral college is the way to go because the congress have no say in the voting. The congress is part of the political system and they should be able to have the final say on who is President.

The Electoral College is a process where selected elector come together and vote for President and Vice President. It consist of 538 electors and majority vote (270) is required to elect the presient (source 1). With the electoral college there is a certainty of outcome . This mean there will never be a tie or draw. It is possible to have a tiwe because there is an even number (538) of electors, But for a tie to happen is very unlikly. (source 3). Having no tie will ensure that we have a Presidnet that a majority of the citizen and even non-citizens are happy with. Also, the Electoral colllege requires a presidential candidate to have trans regiona, all arounf he country, appeal. NO region north, south,east, or west has enough electoral vote to elect a president (source 3). This ensure that one reigion that favourites on candidate has the majority say.

It is possible for the candidate with the most electoral votes not win the national vote. This incident is very unlikly to happen but in 2000 Gore had won the most popualr vote then Bush but had fever electoral votes (source 3). The electoral college has been around for a long time. Many people think it is an out dated way for electing a presidnet and Vice president (source2). The electoral college has been a sucessful way to choose our presidnets in the past. The elctoral college avoids the problem of elections in ehich no canidat receives a majoirty of the popual votes. Many argue that the electoral college method of slecting a president may turn off potenial voters. But the people who do vote are people who wanr a express a political preference rather than people who want to think that their ine singal vote will decide the over-all winner of the election.(source 3)

When chossing a president remember that your one vote will not have a great effect on who is president but the electoral college does. Having both popular vote and electoral college vote will allow all citizen to be involed in the slection of your presient. Getting rid of it my allow more of the non congress citizen to have more of a say. The congress is part of our country to and they should be able to vote the way they want to.",0
"The modern world has seen an abundance of technological advancements, but none more important than the development of smart cities. Smart cities are urban areas that have embraced technology to create a better quality of life for those living and working in them. These cities use sensors, data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) systems to monitor their environment and provide citizens with services that make their lives easier. One notable example of a smart city is Songdo International Business District (IBD), located in South Korea. The city was designed from scratch as a sustainable urban area, utilizing state-of-the-art energy efficient buildings, renewable energy sources and advanced transportation systems. It utilizes various digital technologies including internet-enabled cameras, facial recognition equipment and AI robots to maintain order and safety within the city's boundaries. Additionally, the city offers its citizens access to innovative healthcare services such as virtual hospitals which allow people to receive medical assistance at home when needed. Songdo IBD is also equipped with an advanced waste management system which helps reduce pollution levels by efficiently collecting rubbish from homes across the district while ensuring proper disposal methods are used once it has been collected. This system not only ensures cleaner streets but also results in fewer greenhouse gases being released into our atmosphere making it environmentally friendly as well as comfortable for residents across the entire district. . Smart cities like Songdo International Business District demonstrate how technology can be used to improve everyday life while protecting our planet at the same time - something we should all strive towards achieving! By embracing this kind of innovation we can ensure a better future for generations ahead where everyone enjoys basic amenities without having to worry about environmental damage or safety concerns; providing us with healthier lifestyles both physically and mentally too!",1
"Have you ever been to the beach and watched the magnificent sunset? As you sit on the warm, sandy shoreline with your toes sinking in, a dazzling array of pinks and oranges fill up the sky like an artist's painting. The sun slowly dips down as its golden rays stretch out across the horizon, sending out its last goodbye for another day. Watching a beautiful sunset at the beach is one of life’s simple pleasures that never fails to make us pause from our busy lives and appreciate nature’s beauty. One moment stands out amongst my travels to various beaches around the world – watching a breathtakingly beautiful sunset in Costa Rica. I was standing near Playa Avellana while waiting for my friends when I spotted it - vibrant oranges mixed with soft pinks radiating through wispy clouds hovering above an endless blue ocean beneath them. It almost looked unreal yet so real at once; how could something be so captivating yet fleeting all at once? I stood there in awe for several minutes until reality brought me back: “Hey! What are you doing? We’re ready to go!” My friends had arrived but all I wanted was stay just few moments more and absorb this magical view before leaving it behind forever. The beauty of these sunsets is that they come with no expectations or obligations attached other than enjoying their presence right then and there without worrying about what comes next or if circumstances will change; instead just appreciating each moment as precious gift because we can never get them back again. These brief moments remind us not only of our mortality but also how important it is take time away from our hectic schedules now and then just let ourselves be filled by nature's magic while watching ethereal displays of color dance across an infinite night sky during golden hour times. As humans, we are so lucky to experience such gorgeous creations made by Mother Nature every single day – particularly those seen from atop beautiful beach settings",1
"The author has a good point. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. It is believe that it was covered with large oceans and supported forms of life, however various spacecrafts only survived several hours when landing on Venus.

First off, Venus still has Earth-like features. The planet has a rocky surface and includes valleys, mountains, and craters. However the temperature on Venus surface averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and it is said that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. So why is it believed that life once existed on this planet? It is extremely dangerous to send anyone to Venus, because they most likely wouldn't make it back home. Let alone survive a couple hours. The author stated that NASA is working on other ways to study Venus without risking the lives of others. Which I believe is a good idea. It'll spark more people's interest in knowing the plants around us.

Despite the dangers Venus has eventually NASA will find a way to successfully send a spacecraft or group of people up there without doing any harm. Even though life today cannot exist on Venus because of the tempature and air quality, it is worth looking into.",0
"Dear state senator,

By my own opinion i really consider of having the votes based off popularity and also facts . I belive that some of the people that do want to become president someday will not become that because their votes mainly deals with the electoral colloges and what they really when the counts of the votes should be really counted off what the people of the united states really think or who they think our president should really be. Some people think we should have a black president or a white president green,purple,or blue it really doesnt matter in my opinion i think i am speaking for everyone when i say that wewant a person that would make great descisions for the umited states a person that is welling to go above and beyond to make our countrymore better and a safe place to all . And at the end of the day people in america doesnt want or think that it is right to have a female president sitting in the seat of a president,i say simply because the people of the USA doesnt think women have enough power or orders, or authority i think women should have the same rights as men. But at the end of the day i think that the people of the united states should have a right to choose who they want to serve as or president , someone who would make change and make the USA a better and safer place for everyone. Someone whois very well educated and have a outlook or reach of things. It shouldnt be based off the electoral colleges because america might disagree with their descison and cause a whole lot of chaos.",0

"Unhealthy texting and driving

Teens and young adults today love texting and being on technology. Technology is a great way to communicate with fellow friends and family. However, there are times where people should put phones down and focus to protect the safety of others. People should not use the phone while driving and on the job while working.

People should always have the phone put up while driving.

It is very dangerous and unsafe to text and drive. When it comes to texting and driving, teens are more likely to be found doing this. Every teen should have the phone away from them and should only use it when they are at a complete stop and parked.

People should not be driving distracted when other passengers lives are in their hands. When others are in the car, it is crucially important for the driver to focus and maintain their driving on the road. Passengers should also make sure they use their seat belt and make sure the driver is focused to ensure their own safety.

Teens are not the only ones texting and driving, young adults are just as worst. Young adults have jobs that call them while they are on the road, which causes a big distraction. Young adults and teens combined are a series of added wrecks and deaths. Deaths due to texting and driving continues to rise. The death toll could easily be lowered if people would just not text and drive.

There would be less deaths and car wrecks from distracted driving.

When it comes to texting and driving, it is a major issue for truck drives. Truck drivers are far worse than teens and adults in their cars. Most drivers wear headsets to communicate while on the road. Headsets are more safe for truck drivers to use instead of having their phone in hand and lose control of the wheel.

When drivers wreck, there are huge consequences. Passengers that are in the vehicle and others involved in the accident have the opportunity to sue or charge the driver. Drivers should always think of the consequences of what will happen if they pick up their phone, lose control, and wreck with people in the car. Drivers should also be off their technology even when they are alone riding safety is number one priority which is why phones should not be used driving.",0
"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because if the computer read you are bored it can change to somthing more fun. If the computer read you are sad it and change to somthing happy. Also is it read you are happy it can stay like that.

If you are reading or doing somthing bording your full focus wouldn't be on it so if the computer read that it can change it to somthing more fun to read or do. It can make it more happy or scary (if you like that). It will make those days when you know you have to read something bording fun.

Next, there are people who don't read as fast or understand like other so if you get a little confused the FACS can change it to your level or it can have someone help you by reading it or giving you tools to understand more.

Last, if you are enjoying the text you are reading or work you are doing the FACS can let the computer know to stay on it and it can give you more like that for your enjoyment.

In conclutiond the FACS is valuable in classroom because it can make boreding things more fun. It can make the reading your level if you are confused. Also if the like what you are reading and can give you more like it.",0
"Dear State Senator

I know you have been thinking about if we should still use Electoral collage or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I am here to inform you that i believe that keeping the Electoral College may still help us. By having Electoral College you can swing states and biggers states.

To begin with, keeping the electoral college may be a good idea. When having you could swing states. In the passage In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President the passage states that The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates(paragraph 20) The qoute is explaining that by having candidates from toss up states, the voters would help the elections. The voters would actually be interested in the electon and pay attention to what is happening. Having voters from toss up states may help decide the election.

Second, Keeping Electoal College may benefit us in many ways. If we keep Electoral College than we would bring in bigger states. In the passage its states that  The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. (paragraph 21) The quote is explaing that when there is a bigger state involved then the larger states would get the most attention from any presidential candidates. Being a larger states give people more of a advantage. An example they gave in the paragraph 21 (5. big states) it explains that the popular vote was very close in florida(in 2012); nevertheless obama, who won that vote,got 29 electoral votes. the example was explaining that since florida was bigger we got more votes so that lead to Obama winning.

In conclusion,thats why i believe we should keep Electoral College. Electoral Collage would swing states, and involve big states.",0
"Poof! Cars are starting to disappear. Many cities and countries are prohibiting car use, they feel it would be drop pollution rates. Your probably thinking right now; this is crazy, who would ban cars? Just think about it there are many advantages to not having a car. First, you wouldn'nt have to worry about gas, theres no need to buy gas if you dont have a car. Second, you'll become healthier. Third, more interraction with the world.

All the money you spend on gas.. what a shame! If we didn't have cars you'd have more money, imagine what you would do with all that money. Maybe a nicer house or maybe a nice big pool in the backyard, you'd never know unless you give it a try. I know what your thinking how would I get to work or how would I get to the doctors; they're would still be public transportation to get you to important places.

If there were no cars, many people would be a lot healthier. Not just people, the environment would be a much healthier places. Polution rates go down, less asthma attacks, more fun, no honking, no worrying about wether the kids are alright to be outside by themselves; sounds good to me. There would also be more family bonding, go for nice walks to the park or beach.

Imagine your walking down the street, you know everyone, you stop and talk, maybe laugh. That's what it'd be like with no cars. Not one face on the street that you didn't know. Many gatherings with friends, many laughs, a lot of fun it sounds like.

The car culture is starting to end in many countries and cities including the United States of America. No cars sounds nice, yes maybe you you think there would be many poor effects on the culture but you also have to look at the bright side. More money, you'd become healthier, and you'd have more interractions with world.",0
"When it comes to items found on the ground, it is important to be aware of our actions and think twice before taking something that is not ours. Doing so can have serious consequences, not only from a legal standpoint but also on our moral character. Taking something found on the ground that someone else has lost shows a lack of respect for that person's belongings and is a sign of disrespect towards them. Not only this but it also implies a disregard for the law and our own principles, as we are breaking the law and taking something that does not belong to us. Furthermore, taking something that is not ours can unintentionally lead to more serious consequences such as theft. Therefore, it is important to be aware of our actions when it comes to items found on the ground and not take something that is not ours in order to remain within legal boundaries and develop a sense of morality and respect for other people's property.",1
"In the passage, it talked about this new technology that can break down your facial expression and figure out your mood. In this case, they did Mona Lisa. They said, her face was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 2 percent angry. I dont know they are to come up with these percentages.

I feel like this technology can come into good use, although, i just dont really see the importants of it. In cases like this one, with Mona Lisa, yes i feel as if it was a great thing, but i just dont see any other good uses for it. I would really like to find out another use for this technology to be able to think it is very useful.

I do think this technology is very interesting. I like how it broke up Mona Lisas face into three different emotions. I think that is very cool. I dont see any other use for the technology, but if it is just used for paintings, i think it could be kinda useful. I would like to see the technology in action more to see what all it can do. I want to see it figure out peoples emotions by the look on their face. I hope to see more of this technology in the future. I would also like to know who the inventors of this technology are. You would have to be very smart to be able to invent something like this.",0
"Dear Senator the electoral voting system should be abolished it is unofair and undemocratic electoral votes are not the votes of the people and thats all that should matter but there are countercaims that I will address. when person votes they do not actually vote ofor their candidate they vote ofor a group oof electors ofor that candidate electors who may not even vote ofor the candidate they are sworn to. the electoral voting system is extremely unstable there are an even number oof electoral voters in the united states making a tied vote a possibility which is very bad. Even though electoral votes are supposedly based on which candidates people vote ofor it does not at all mean that the candidate who most oof the people voted ofor wil also be voted ofor by the electoral college.

The electoral voters are separated by state and each state has its own number oof electoral voters proportional to their population. because oof this candidates change their campaigns to only ofocus on stateswith more electoral voters while this makes sense ofrom a competitive perspective it makes it extremely unofair to states with smaller populations. This is wrong in many ways but the worst oof all is that the electoral voting system encourages this kind oof competition The electoral voting system is undemocratic the united states prides itselof on being ofor the people and ofreedom but the electoral college represents the exact opposite oof that. the electoral college votes not the people. the people are not voting and that is the exact opposite oof what the united states supossedly stands ofor. Anyone who learns about the united states and sees the electoral college will think that the united states. is not all its cracked up to be and that is not what the united states wants is it?

in conclusion the senator you should deofinetly try to work toward abolishing the electoral college as it is undemocratic because it does not allow the people to have a direct say in who they are voting ofor. it is a very volatile voting system that could cause crashes and severities in the united states by aving tied votes and such. the electoral voting system encourages some states to be leoft out by unofair competition because oof the unstable way the number oof electoral voters are balanced between states. And the electoral college essentially goes against everything the united states stands ofor and is supposed to believe in.",0
"As social creatures, humans have a natural inclination towards forming connections with others. Our social interactions and experiences shape our personalities and beliefs, and ultimately, our sense of self. It is therefore reasonable to assume that our identification with social groups plays a significant role in defining who we are. In this essay, I will argue that while identification with social groups is an essential aspect of our self-conception, it is not the only factor that defines us.

To begin with, people join social groups as a way of finding their place in society. By identifying with a particular group, we affirm our values and beliefs, and we feel a sense of belonging. For example, a person who joins a political party is likely to share it's core ideology and principles, and by doing so, they define themselves as a political person. Similarly, someone who becomes a member of a religious organization will subscribe to it's beliefs and practices, and through this affiliation, they will define themselves as religious.

Moreover, social groups provide us with a framework for self-evaluation. We often compare ourselves with others who share our social identity to gauge our progress and worth. For instance, a musician who is part of a band will compare their skills and accomplishments with those of their bandmates. This comparison helps them understand where they stand in the group and motivates them to improve their skills to achieve their goals.

However, while identifying with social groups is an essential aspect of our self-conception, it is not the only factor that shapes who we are. We are also shaped by our individual experiences and personal relationships. Our family, friends, and romantic partners influence our values, beliefs, and behavior. For example, a person who grew up in a conservative family may hold traditional values, even if they are not part of a conservative social group.

Furthermore, our experiences outside of social groups also shape our sense of self. Our work, hobbies, and personal achievements contribute to our self-conception. For example, someone who has run a marathon or published a book may define themselves as a runner or a writer, respectively, even if they do not belong to a social group that shares these interests.

In conclusion, while our identification with social groups is a crucial aspect of our self-conception, it is not the only factor that defines us. Our individual experiences, personal relationships, and personal achievements also shape our sense of self. It is therefore essential to recognize that we are complex individuals whose sense of self is shaped by a multitude of factors.",1
"Giving details and information, I think the author explained well the dangers of Venus. He explained the temperatures and how hot it can get there, how it can melt metal things and that it's just not worth living there. But it is worth exploring as in studying it, the rocks and maybe they can find something that could possibly live there. The author supports the idea of studying by saying in paragraph 8 how Venus has value and how Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limilted by dangers and doubts but she be expanded to meet the very edges or imagination and innovation.

The author says that it gets over 800 F in Venus, says that it could've been possibly like Earth years ago, where humans can live in. But NASA has to do more studying on rocks and other sediments and onjects on Venus. The author explaines how much carbon dioxide is covering Venus, and I believe carbon dioxide is so good for a planet. The planet isn't very useful to live in since it crushes metalic things, and for example cars, something we need to get around places.",0
"False praise and hope are powerful tools for educators, as they can instantly boost a student's self-esteem and encourage them to work harder. However, these tools must be used carefully and judiciously, as not all students may respond positively to false praise or hope. False praise, for example, can create false expectations, which can lead to disappointment and feelings of inadequacy or shame. Similarly with hope, it is important to provide only realistic and achievable goals, rather than trying to set unrealistic expectations. 

The best way to build and maintain self-esteem is to promote a sense of deep intrinsic motivation in the student. This is achievable by focusing not just on the outcome, but on the process of learning and striving for something worthwhile. This way, accomplishments and successes become less about achieving a goal and more about propelling the student to learn something new and develop skills and knowledge. At the same time, by nurturing the student's sense of worth and ability to overcome setbacks, educators can help build a strong foundation for self-esteem. 

In conclusion, the best way to build and maintain self-esteem is to focus on helping students develop their intrinsic motivation and sense of worth through learning and striving for something worthwhile. By doing so, educators can foster a lasting sense of self-efficacy and self-esteem that can help them become better learners.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage can help in many ways. Limiting cars usage can help gobal warning, traffic, even help families. Cars help us tranport our self or things to places  but the problems that come with having a car, can be stressful.

According to the Article Car-free day in spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Bogota, Colombia is trying to spread its Car Free program to other countries. The Colombia Car Free has help business people relied their stress and help lower the air pollution. The Bogota program promote people to hike, bike, skate or take a buses to work during the Car-Free day. The results from the Car-free day had dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have increased. This shift in driving cars had lowered in the United States. According to the The End of Car Culture, Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. This mean that more citizens are using public tranportation more then driving their Mobile vehicle. This is woven to a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety, according to Chairman of Ford Motor Company. The results are that there are less pollution in the air because of citizens not wanting a vehicle or licenses.

The limiting of car usage is really working. That citizens in different countries are happy with the results of the Car-free day. Its not just help the Countries it helping the people that live in thoses countries.",0
"Citizens are often using cars to get from work and back, however if citizens were to stop using cars there could be some advantages like traffic can be reduced, new buildings can be built, and habits of car use can be stopped.

If citizens were to cut down on using cars traffic would be reduced. According to Robert Duffer a person from the Chicago Tribune he states that congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog (Robert Duffer, paragraph 14). With that being stated by Robert Duffer it should be clear to people that with reduced traffic people are able to get to places where they need to be in just a short matter of time, citizens won't have to worry about being late for whatever it is citizens have to do. Robert Duffer also states that almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters (12) Citizens should realize that with almost 4,000 people being fined it should tell citizens that they should cut down on car usage to help prevent smog and to also save them money.

Along with citizens cutting down on car usage to reduce traffic if they were to cut car usage new building can be built. According to Andrew Selsky from the Seattle Times he states that parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitty sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up (Andrew Selsky, paragraph 28). When citizens cut down on car usage many new things can be built and explored by citizens but if citizens were to not stop car usage then new things wouldn't be built and old things couldn't be replaced or fixed. Andrew Selsky also states that it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths (27). There is many citizens out in the world that would rather ride bikes than to use a car just to prevent pollution, with 118 miles of bicycle paths there shouldn't really be any car use. Using bicycles could help change the world so much more and less pollution could be created.

Not only with citizens cutting down on car use for new buildings to be built, citizens can stop their habits of car usage if they give it a try. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal a lady from the New York Times she states that with all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of recession may find less reason to resume the habit (Elisabeth Rosenthal, paragraph 36).Citizens stopping car commuting could really help those citizens with habits of not being able to stop car commuting  which could result in saving the earth and air pollution. Elisabeth also states that a chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedstrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety (43). While the chairman of the Ford Motor Company is stating this information maybe citizens will change their minds about car usage just to improve safety or to even safe time.

All in all this why citizens should car usage to reduce traffic, new buildings can be built, and to try and stop habits of car use by giving it a try. Citizens trying to do these could help stop air pollution and they could also save themselves money.",0
"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) brings students a new type of learning environment. Author Nick D'Alto wrote the article Making Mona Lisa Smile educating readers on the new facial expression innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleague use this tool to find new ways for computers and humans to communicate. This new system brings a new type of learning, allowing the students to retain and understand information better.

D'Alto is the writer, but Dr. Huang has emphasized that FACS would bring the students a new type of online learning, making them more interested in the lesson. Dr. Huang explains this innovation as he says, A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor. (Paragraph 6). This new change would make the lesson more beneficial to the student as it would make the student more interested in the lesson, further allowing them to retain information better later on.

The lesson may be beneficial to the student academically, but is it causing mental health issues as it supports more screen time? FACS is all computer based, meaning less time in the classroom and more time infront of the computer. The student would be conducting this program on a school computer as D'Alto explains, Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms (Paragraph 7) the program ends up promoting more screen time, something that students should get less of, instead of human interaction, which our society needs more of. In a way FACS program is not beneficial or valuable to the student mentally as it promotes something that our society needs less of.

This technology could be also very beneficial to those who do not have the best teacher or education available to them. When FACS makes that facial emotion recognition it adjust the lesson, allowing the students to understand the lesson better, as Dr. Huang explained. This would be beneficial to students who have a poor education environment as their teachers might not recognize these facial expressions, causing the student to not understand the lesson which later leads them to falling behind in class.

This new technology has many pros and cons, but also brings students a new way of understanding. FACS could possibly bring grades up along with educational improvement. This program may support more screen time, causing students mental health issues, along with eyesight to deteriorate, but if this program is used wisely, none of those things should happen. This new technology should bring a new way of understanding, making FACS a valuable resource to students.",0
"A discussion of the importance of physical education in our school system is a pressing matter. Physical education classes have been integrated into public schools for decades, but recent debates suggest that their efficacy is questionable and they may be irrelevant to modern students’ needs. This essay will explore why physical education remains essential for all students, from elementary through high school. The first reason physical education should remain in the curriculum involves overall health and well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), regular physical activity has countless benefits such as strengthening bones and muscles, reducing feelings of depression or anxiety, improving sleep patterns, increasing energy levels and helping maintain a healthy weight. With rising rates of childhood obesity—due largely to poor diets—and lifestyle-related diseases like diabetes soaring among young people today, it's clear that children need guidance on how to stay active and healthy. Physical education provides an important opportunity for promoting general health awareness while teaching movement skills necessary for living a physically active life throughout adulthood. Another important benefit associated with physical education is its ability to create confidence in all students regardless of athletic ability level, size or gender identity/expression. At this stage in development many kids are still searching out ways they can fit into their peer groups more easily; having access to recreational games helps them find enjoyable activities where everyone can participate without fear of judgement from others based on sexuality or body shape/size issues – both which are common at this age group. Studies by the CDC show that providing students with positive experiences gained through exercise can lead not only short term improvements but also long term sustainability when it comes fostering self esteem within children who often feel uncomfortable due social pressures during adolescence years . . Finally , regularly participating in P E classes gives student s hands -on lessons regarding team building skills , sportsmanship , problem solving strategies , communication techniques along with understanding basic rules governing various sporting activities . These valuable skill sets help prepare individuals entering college life or professional careers because not only have these abilities",1
"Man is a social animal. He needs to know how to relate to other people and to be accepted by them. Therefore, it is important for him to learn many different kinds of subjects, such as history, geography, mathematics, science, literature, and so on. The more subjects he knows, the better he will be able to understand the world around him and the people in it. If you are a man and you want to become a better man, you should learn as many subjects as you can, so that you will have a wide range of knowledge to draw upon when you need to make important decisions in your life.

What is the most important thing you learned in school? What is your favorite subject and why? How did you learn it? Do you think you would have learned it differently if you had been taught it in a different way? If so, what was the best way to teach it to you?",1
"While some may believe that sports are just a game, there is much more to it than meets the eye. Specifically, the role of sports in developing healthy relationships and fostering positive mental health outcomes among youth has been an area of increasing interest for many years. Sports provide a unique opportunity for young people to interact with their peers in constructive and meaningful ways. Through team building activities within practices and games, young athletes learn how to build trust between teammates while also learning valuable skills such as working together towards a common goal. This allows them to foster strong relationships with their peers based on respect and understanding, which will carry into other interpersonal relationships throughout their lives. The physical benefits of playing sports are well documented; however, there is also evidence that suggests regular participation helps develop children’s self-esteem and confidence levels as well as improve overall mental wellbeing by providing children with a sense of belonging and structure during times when life can be chaotic or uncertain. Studies have found that students who participate in organized sport display higher levels of psychological resilience when faced with stressful situations compared to those who do not take part in any form of sporting activity. Additionally, research has demonstrated increased feelings of empowerment following involvement in competitive sport due to enhanced social support systems amongst participants which provides individuals with motivation outside the classroom environment. . As our society continues its shift away from traditional values regarding gender roles within society, it is essential that both boys and girls engage equally in structured sporting programs so all may reap the same rewards associated with being physically active through teamwork initiatives whilst building important life skills along the way such as self-discipline and communication abilities - traits which cannot be taught solely through academic pursuits alone but rather only through practical application via sport participation experiences. Though sometimes overlooked or unfairly criticized upon occasion due its need for significant time commitments or perceived elitism often ascribed to certain club teams – involving oneself (or one’s family) regularly participating in organized sport can bring immense value beyond simply improving",1
"I believe that the use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and useful. Imagine this, you are a child in a boring old science or math class and you are frowning and you are just so bored. Then all of a sudden your teacher is making the lesson more interesting by adding superheros or music. How did she do that? Now put yourself into the shoes of the teacher in that situation. You look on your computer and see that your whole class is bored and angry. Why not make this more interesting by putting on upbeat music and adding glitter and bright colors to your notes? That is what you can do with this new technology.

This technology would be really useful in all the classrooms. If you put it on the teachers computers it would really bring the childrens grades up and hopefully keep them interested and thinking about what tomorrows lesson is going to be like. With this new technology it might even keep kids out of trouble just so they won't miss their favorite class with their new favorite teacher.

The text has many many pros of why you would want this program in classrooms. In paragraph one it states, She's 83 percent happy, 9 percest disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This is when they were talking about the Mona Lisa. The Facial Action Coding System shows all the emotion Mona Lisa was showing even though it is a painting and was painted a very long time ago. In paragraph three the text states, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. and paragraph four, Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. These examples show all the emotions it can identify, such as the Mona Lisa and her mixed emotions. Another quote says, For instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. The last two example and quotes I gave prove how intelligent this machine is. It can identify emotions better thanus humans, and we make the facial expressions!

This technology may be great and all but the only downside is that you can not have it on your laptop, the text states, Your home PC can't handles the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. This has some pros and some cons. One con in the text says, Imagine a computer thqat knows when you're happy or sad, For examples, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. That could be really upsetting considering how annoying some ads are. For example if you have a cat but it is showing an ad for bird food, what will that be useful for?

If teachers couldn't have the program for the Facial Action Coding System on their school computers they could always jusrt smile and try to be happy. In paragrqaph nine the text states, According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. The author also states, A renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. This shows that of a teacher smiles or laughs or changes her voice to a more upbeat pitch, the students may be more happy with the lesson.",0
"Rosa Parks became an icon of the civil rights movement for her determined stand against racial discrimination. A seamstress from Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks was arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. In response to her arrest, members of the African American community in Montgomery initiated a boycott of the city’s bus system. This boycott helped catalyze national efforts to end racial segregation.

The motivating force behind Rosa Parks's actions was her strong work ethic and enduring commitment to justice. As Thomas Jefferson said, “I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.” Rosa recognized the potential of a future where everyone was treated equally and she was determined to achieve that vision. “Character is like a tree and reputation is like its shadow,” Jefferson said. Rosa's commitment to her beliefs ensured her place in history. Ultimately, Rosa Parks's courageous stand demonstrated the potential of a determined work ethic to bring about positive change.",1
"The United States has been known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but that's not all. It's also known for the different freedoms made available and its fair government. The electoral college is a system in which states choose representatives to vote on the president. In the past, there was a big debate on whether or not this process was fair. The electoral college is not fair or trustworthy for many reasons.

Imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. Sadly, they ended up changing their mind. You could end up with a president you don't like or believe in. Voters don't have total control over who their electors vote for. To me, that doesn't sound very fair. If everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. Based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. That means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. Our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it's our right to a fair vote.

There are more problems than just an unfair vote. It almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. In the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have seperated the victor from the loser. What would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? Who would become president? I'm sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but I don't believe it could. Since there are less people making the descision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. If one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. Also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. The people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their descision, so they deserve recognition too.

The electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. Americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. Also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. America is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. So, let's give Americans the chance for a fair vote. z",0
"We need to stop having electoral colleges its unfair and really out of date most poeple dont even see a campaighn with electoral votes. If we were to change to popular voting then we could have everyone involved in the voting and it would be fair voting and desisions for everyone who is involved. When your in a electoral vote you are not voting for a president but for a slate of electors.

It is not fair for state legislatures to pick our electors thats why we had the big fiasco back in 2000. The government basically has full control over the who really gets the win of the vote if we stay in the elactoral vote system they have free reighn on what electors to send to congress on whom ever they agree with. In a electoral vote bigger states gets the most attention from presedental campaighns and a smaller state wouldnt get any attention at all to the campaighn In electoral votes they have toss up states which are states that will pay the campaighn very close attention which basically means they choose who wins because their known as thoughtful voters.

The reason we should do away with the electoral system and out in the popular system is because it is alot more easy to get involved with and you have control over whose president and the elevtors not the government. We have the right to pick our presedints and congress so we should do it right and in a fair way.",0
"It is true that encouraging young people to believe they can accomplish great things if they try hard enough has the potential to be misleading and harmful. On one hand, having a confidence and a positive outlook on life can be beneficial and help young people develop a healthy attitude. On the other hand, if they are told they can achieve anything they set their mind to and don’t receive the outcome they were expecting, it may have a damaging effect on their self-esteem and lead to damaging consequences.

To begin, it is important for young people to be confident in order to reach their potential. With a positive outlook, young people may feel inspired to take on challenges, persist even when tasks become difficult, and ultimately reach their goals. A study conducted by the Institute of Education Sciences found that students who had higher levels of self-confidence had higher academic achievements, specifically in mathematics and reading. Moreover, a study conducted by the American Psychological Association found that students with higher levels of self-confidence had higher grades and fewer psychological symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, it is important to encourage young people to have a positive outlook and believe in themselves.

However, when young people are told they can achieve anything they set their mind to, there is a risk of false expectations. This may lead to disappointment if the young person does not reach the outcome they were expecting. For example, if a young person is told they can become a professional athlete if they just try hard enough, they may work hard and not succeed. This could lead to the young person feeling like a failure and lead to a lack of self-confidence and a negative outlook on life.

Additionally, this type of encouragement may also lead to a sense of entitlement and an expectation that success should be easy when in reality, it takes hard work, dedication, and resilience to achieve success. This could lead to a young person feeling impatient when facing challenges and give up when things get tough. For example, if a young person is told they can get perfect grades if they just try hard enough, they may become frustrated when their grades don’t reach their expectations and give up.

In conclusion, while it is important to instill confidence in young people and provide them with positive encouragement, it is also important to provide realistic expectations. It is important to emphasize that success requires hard work, dedication, and resilience and that failure is part of the process. Moreover, it is important to emphasize that everyone has unique talents and abilities and that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to success. Doing so will provide young people with an accurate understanding of how to achieve success and will prevent them from feeling disappointed and defeated when expectations are not met.",1
"Do you think it's ok for people do drive while having a cell phone? Well in my opinion i think people should not have a cell phone while driving because cell phone use while driving statistics shows that the behavior is common in dangerous in teens drivers. According to the national safety council 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics shows that multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life threatening norm. talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media post takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent. High school students who reported frequent texting while driving where less likely to wear a seatbelt more likely too ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol. Driving while talking or texting on the cell phone .The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads too 1.6million crashes each year. Teen driver with only one additional passenger doubles the risk of getting into a fatal car accident. Teen drivers are 4x more likely than adults too get into car crashes when talking or testing on the cell phone. while driving many things can cause you to crash talking and texting, gps, adjusting music, putting on makeup,talking too the passenger, and not looking at the road.",0

Ito mighto have been effectoive when ito was firsto creatoed, buto now ito docento seem like ito can work outo anymore. Leto me toell you why.

Well for stoartoers, under tohe Electooral College systoem, votoers votoe noto for tohe presidento, buto votoe for a slatoe of electoors, who in tourn electo tohe presidento.

Plumer decides too writoe: Do votoers sometoimes geto confused abouto tohe electoors and votoe for tohe wrong candidatoe? Sometoimes. This is why tohe Electooral College needs too be abolished.

This is noto a feasible systoem for a coutory tohatos supposed too be a democracy.

"In recent years, it has become quite clear that a lack of education can have far-reaching consequences. For one, a lack of education can lead to poverty. In a world where the wealth and resources are increasingly becoming globalized, a lack of education can lead to a person having limited opportunities and being unable to compete in the global economy.

Another consequence of a lack of education is that a person is likely to be unable to find a job they are excited about or that will help them meet their life goals. In an increasingly competitive job market, it is important to have a good education if you want to be able to find a good job and provide for yourself and your family.

A lack of education can also lead to a person being unable to find a good job. A good job is one that pays well and allows you to support yourself and your family. A lack of education can lead to a person having lower-paying jobs that do not allow them to live a comfortable life.

A lack of education can also lead to a person having low self-esteem. A lack of education can mean that a person does not have the skills necessary to find a good job or to do well in school. A lack of education can lead to a person feeling like they are not capable of anything.

In a world where a good education is increasingly important, it is important to make sure that all children have access to a good education. This can be done through things like providing more financial assistance to students who are struggling to afford school, increasing the number of schools and teachers, and making it easier for students to transfer to a new school if they are unable to continue their education in their current school.

A lack of education can have serious consequences for a person's life. A lack of education can mean that a person does not have the skills necessary to find a good job or to do well in school. A lack of education can lead to a person feeling like they are not capable of anything. A lack of education can also lead to a person being unable to find a good job, which can lead to poverty and other problems.

"University education has long been considered as the gateway to a successful career. However, some people believe that the purpose of university education goes beyond employment preparation. In my opinion, I agree with this view as universities play a significant role in shaping individuals' personal and intellectual growth, promoting social mobility, and advancing research and innovation.

Firstly, universities provide an environment that encourages personal and intellectual growth. Students learn to think critically, communicate effectively, and develop problem-solving skills. The university experience exposes students to diverse perspectives, cultures, and ideas, which broadens their understanding of the world. For instance, attending a literature class can help students develop empathy, creativity, and analytical skills, which are essential for personal growth. Therefore, universities should not be solely viewed as a means to an end, but rather as a place to gain knowledge and skills that can be applied to various aspects of life.

Secondly, universities promote social mobility by providing equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their socioeconomic background. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds can access financial aid, scholarships, and other support services that enable them to pursue their education. This creates a level playing field, where individuals can achieve their full potential based on their merit and hard work, rather than their social status. For example, a student from a low-income family who graduates from university can break the cycle of poverty and achieve upward social mobility.

Finally, universities play a crucial role in advancing research and innovation. Universities are centers of knowledge creation, where researchers and academics work to solve complex problems and develop new technologies. The research conducted in universities has led to breakthroughs in medicine, engineering, and other fields, which have improved the quality of life for people worldwide. Therefore, universities are not only preparing students for employment but also advancing knowledge and contributing to society's progress.

In conclusion, university education serves multiple purposes beyond employment preparation. Universities provide an environment for personal and intellectual growth, promote social mobility, and advance research and innovation. Therefore, the value of university education should not be limited to it's ability to prepare students for employment but rather it's contribution to individuals' personal and intellectual growth and society's progress.",1
"if we go to the second planet from the sun the gravity would be more tense and would have different affects on humans. the gravity on venus would pull them down more than earth because it is closer to the sun by two planets away. but we also need to think about the air and the atmosphere because if we just go there then we might die. the air on venus is un supportive to humans and the water is not there or it might be a type of water that if you drink it it will kill you. the storms on venus are acid storms, the rain is acid. so i think the only reason why the author is saying that venus is a challenge is because not only the facts above. but also that the fact is that on the serface, temperetures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we humans experience on earth. so he also might be saying that it might be a challenge because if we take a rocket, it might be torn apart if we dont have the right mesurements.",0
"The culture of the cars is a easier way of transportation for the people, yet do the people know that these cars are space consumers and cause smog in most areas of the world. By just reducing the amount of cars invarious locations the amount of space would increase the therefore make town or city more accessible for the large population. this change of culture may benefit the population by just having the public transportation and biking.

To begin with the space consuming in suburbs makes it hard most people make a living in the tight area and having the certain parking areas may be the only way to have the space needed to get to where they need to be, yet its all timed. this makes people more tense when they had to worry of a parking spot. The people in Germany weren't allowed to park the sides of the road and have drive ways unless they payed an extra 40,000 along with a home. As said the text vayan, had completed a trend of separating the car use from the suburban life, this is what they called the smart planning. also to include that other areas of the world such as Beijing, China, has to worry more the amount of smog polluting their air and making people ill. In Paris, France, diesel fuel was blamed for the pollution because most of the cars were made up of this fuel. they were rank the most polluted area compared other locations. Therefore to reduce the amount of the complaints of the lack of space and pollution the want to either rid of the cars or just buy more plugincars and hybrids for cleaner air.

Not to mention, that in Bogota, Colombia they completely banned the cars from their country for a day to promote an alternative transportation and reduce the smog. the violators are faced 25 fines. As said the text, the stress level has dropped and therefore has made easier for the people to more around and not get so aggravated. The authorities from other countries came to the event to see what they had in store for the this program, and as said in the text the authorites say that these people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders. And in the United States, President Obama has ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions Americans are buying fewer cars and are getting fewer licenses. By creating a new network that has the pedestrians have bicycles, private cars and commercial and public transportation. this to show time saved, conserved resources, lower emissions and improve safety. by not just completly getting rid of cars but just reducing it, it may help them to have more smooth system.

To conclude this, the culture of cars has been a issue for someyears and in some areas very diificult to handle therefore they have created a more effiecent way to make life easier for most people. the world has to reduce the smog and increase the space for more compact living and larger populations. By not to get rid of the culture car completly but to just reduce it can be benificial to the people and the world.",0
"There was a time when it was possible for someone to be regarded as a hero and to hold that perception in a society for a long period of time. In the past, heroes were often celebrated for their achievements in art, science, sport, or politics. Heroes were seen as people who had achieved something extraordinary and were highly respected and admired by the public.

However, in the age of intensive media coverage, it is becoming increasingly difficult for a society to view any woman or man as a hero for any extended period of time. This is because the media has become more intrusive, and more focused on finding stories that will capture the attention of the public. As a result, it is no longer possible for someone to be seen as a hero without being subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism.

For example, recently there have been numerous stories of athletes, who were once regarded as heroes, being involved in scandals or poor behaviour. These scandals have caused many people to question the athlete’s role as a hero, and in some cases, to reject them as a hero altogether. Similarly, there are numerous stories in the media of politicians being accused of corruption or other immoral activities. Once again, these stories often cause society to re-evaluate the politician’s status as a hero.

The problem is that in an age of intensive media coverage, it is becoming more and more difficult for a society to maintain a positive perception of a hero. This is because any mistake or mistake is quickly reported and often distorted in the media. This results in the public becoming very critical and judgmental of the hero, which ultimately leads to a negative perception and the hero’s reputation being diminished.

In conclusion, it is clear that in the age of intensive media coverage, it is no longer possible for a society to regard any woman or man as a hero for an extended period of time. This is because any mistake or scandal is quickly reported and often distorted in the media, which causes the public to become very critical and judgmental of the hero.

"The usage of cars has really changed the way our world works. These expensive vehicles are what make make our world what it is and people take advantage of it. With cars we get to places faster than on a bike or even walking. Many people forget how cars work though. It takes up about 2,000 dollars a month depending on which car they have on gas and maintenance. The advantages of limiting car usage is reducing the amount of fuel the we use, we would save thousands of dollars, and become more green in the world. People prefer walking or biking to school or on their way home.

Driving starts at the age of 15. Imagine all the work parents do to drive their kids to school, then to work, and then pick up their kids from after school. Its crazy how much of gas an adult would be using every single day. Ofcourse picking up their kids from school is a guarantee but their are many other solutions to these type of things. If we started to use less fuel it would bring our economy out of debt. In the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal The End of car culture states that Americans have not been buying cars as often and driving less and fewer license being given over the years. The era of cars and driving could be coming to an end and creating a new way of getting to places. People would say that taking the bus might become the new strategy but who knows what the future holds for America, by the year 2030 we will be flying in cars or transportation to get to where we need to be. Transportation is the second largest source in America and vehicles are becoming something much different.

In New York a bikesharing program has started due to all the traffic and crowded streets their are people just take the subway and get to places faster than a car. Things like that save so much money. A change in the world would be very dramatic since everyone is so used to driving a car and getting to where they need to be. Studies shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal that even kids who live in urban areas that are 1921 do not have license and are perfectly happy with out having one. With the amount of money people can save in motorvehicles is ridiculous. The money they save can be used for many other important things in life like food and house spending all those things can get someone stressed could be fixed just by reducing the use of cars. Who says walking or biking isn't good for the soul.

Technology has really changed our lives and made our generation of children a new perspective that other never saw. As a teenager we are so dependant on many thingas and get addicted very fast to whatever comes at us. A day with out a car is like a day with out a phone. We wouldnt be able to particapat in anything. A car will take us where we want to go. Unlike in those movies where all the kids just bike to places, it seems more fun and interesting in that way. With all the money being spent we could be more green in the world as well. Everything is so manufactured in the world that people wonder why our economy is awful. Being eco friendly is the best way to go if everyone particiaptes in the cause. The world would honestly be such a better place if we all particapated in making it better.

Causes and actions have consequences in our world. The usage of cxars are very dependant on people and if we made a change people will be happier in life because they'll have more to recieve. Our world can become a much better place where people won't have to suffer with money because due to cars we pay alot of money that doesnt have to be spent. Cars can increase alot of positive things in everyones life and it will start out just by a casual walk on the street.",0
"Huge rock fomation. . .which resembles a human head..... Was created by aliens; or was it. People come up with some insane conspiracy's from how people who have died are still alive or that amusment parks are haunted by the dead... but this is the craziest one.

"Education is a life-long process. This means that learning is an ongoing activity that never really stops. Even after obtaining a college degree, people can continue to learn by reading books, attending workshops, and participating in other educational activities.

One reason why education is a life-long process is that technology is constantly changing. In order to keep up with the latest trends, it is necessary to continue learning. For example, people who want to work in the technology field must stay current with the latest software and computer systems.

In addition, the world is constantly changing. As a result, it is important for people to keep up with the latest news and developments. For example, if someone wants to work in the field of politics, they need to be aware of the latest news and events.

Finally, education is a life-long process because it allows people to learn new things. Even if someone has been working in the same field for many years, they can still learn new things that can help them improve their work. For example, a doctor can continue to learn about new medical treatments and procedures.

In conclusion, education is a life-long process because it allows people to learn new things, stay current with technology, and keep up with the latest news and developments.",1
"In the world we live in today, there is no doubt that the media has a tremendous impact on our society. They have the power to shape our understanding of people and events, and to influence our opinions and beliefs. One of the ways in which the media has a negative impact is by expecting an individual to speak for a particular group, whether or not that person truly represents the views of the entire group. I strongly believe that this is a mistake, and in this essay, I will explain why.

Firstly, it is unfair to expect one person to represent an entire group. People are diverse and have different opinions and beliefs. Just because someone belongs to a particular group, it does not mean that they speak for everyone in that group. For instance, if a reporter interviews a Muslim person, they should not assume that their views represent those of all Muslims. Islam is a diverse religion with many different interpretations, and it would be wrong to assume that one person could speak for everyone.

Secondly, individuals may have their own interests and agendas, which may not align with the rest of the group. For example, a politician may claim to speak for a particular ethnic group, but in reality, they may only be interested in advancing their own career or agenda. In such cases, the individual may not truly represent the views of the entire group, and it would be a mistake to assume that they do.

Thirdly, the media's tendency to expect individuals to speak for a group can lead to harmful stereotypes and prejudices. If the media presents one person as representing an entire group, it can create the impression that all members of that group think and behave in the same way. This can lead to harmful stereotypes and prejudices, which can further marginalize and discriminate against certain groups. For instance, if the media presents one black person as representing all black people, it can lead to harmful stereotypes about black people being lazy, criminal, or violent.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the media-and society in general-should not expect an individual to speak for a particular group, whether or not that person truly represents the views of the entire group. This practice is unfair, can be misleading, and can lead to harmful stereotypes and prejudices. Instead, we should seek to understand the diversity of opinions and beliefs within a group, and listen to a range of voices. By doing so, we can create a more just and equitable society, where everyone's voice is heard and valued.",1
"Don't Fear, Ask Your Peers!

Have you ever done something stupid? Well, if you got someone else's opinion before you did it, would you have done it? Seeking others opinion before doing something is helpful because you get many different view points and reduces the chances of risk.

First, everyone has many different experiences,that means we all can have different view points. Having different view points can help you make wise and profound dissensions. People often need help with school assignment. Asking for others view points on a project or homework can help someone do better on it and get a better grade. Another example is sports, getting someone else's opinion can help improve your playing style and skill level. Also, when get more then one view point, you are more likely to do the right thing. For example, if someone is doing something questionable, someone who has done it or seen the consequences of doing it, can attempt to stop them.

Secondly, if you ask for others opinions before you act, you reduce the chances of risk. While yes, risk can sometimes be a good thing, it can also be a bad thing. For example, someone is trying to jump off the roof of their house to impress their friends. If someone doesn't tell them to stop they may hurt themselves or others. Another, less stress educing example is, someone wants to use profanity in their English paper for excitement. If someone tell them to stop, the risk of getting in trouble is greatly decreased or goes away altogether. It it always best to recuse stress.

In conclusion, ask for others opinions. Everyone makes mistakes and its okay but It is extremely helpful to ask for your peers opinion because it can help reduce risk and you can get many different view points.",0
"Ok, so people think that the aliens made the face on Mars or might be an alien territory, but no. If aliens made a face on Mars, shouldn't have they came to Earth by now? They could've ruled us by now. The Face is a natural landform on Mars.

To prove that this was not caused by aliens, NASA reported, Huge rock formation which resembles a human head that is formed by shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. It is all just an illusion. We have seen some illusions in our past lives in space and maybe on Earth. You think that you see a human in the forest, and figured out that it was a tree.

NASA has send an aircraft or a ship that was called Mars Global Surveyor. The camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing an natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all.

So, if you think that is was the aliens, there's the proof. Aliens didn't create a face on Mars. It was just a landform that web surfers and/or NASA saw. Like I said, aliens should have taken over the galaxy. I guess not. I think they are so nice. You see aliens in youtube videos and movies. Some people think that th video was just edit really perfectly to make the aliens real. Why would the government or Area 51 make this a movie? Are they now spreading the word. Some people think it's real by the theories on what happened on the mountain in North Carolina. Some people in think that an alien spacecraft landed on Nevada. I don't know anything about aliens of course.

There it is, the face is a natural landform on Mars. I have proof that it was not a creation from the aliens. I can't say anything now because I'm speechless. I already said whtat needed to be said in the conclusion. I hope this argumentative essay convinces people to think that the aliens didn't create the Face on Mars.",0
"As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs. However, based on the research and data analysis, I can say that both reading and speaking skills are essential for Chinese learners of English. However, depending on their goals and priorities, one skill may be more important than the other.

For Chinese students who plan to study abroad or pursue higher education in English-speaking countries, reading skills are crucial. It is because most academic materials are in English, and students need to understand complex concepts and theories. Reading can also help them expand their vocabulary, improve their writing skills, and understand cultural differences in the English-speaking world.

On the other hand, speaking skills are equally important, especially for those who intend to work in multinational companies or communicate with native English speakers. Speaking fluently and confidently can help them build relationships, negotiate deals, and express their ideas effectively. Good speaking skills also enhance their employability and career prospects.

Moreover, speaking and reading are interconnected skills, and mastering one can improve the other. For example, reading can help learners understand the grammar and sentence structures used in spoken English. Similarly, practicing speaking can help learners internalize the language rules and improve their pronunciation and intonation.

Therefore, rather than giving priority to one skill over the other, learners should strive to develop both skills simultaneously. They can do this by reading English texts aloud, watching English movies and TV shows with subtitles, participating in language exchange programs, and practicing with native speakers. With consistent effort and practice, they can become proficient in both reading and speaking English.

In conclusion, both reading and speaking skills are essential for Chinese learners of English. Depending on their goals and priorities, one skill may be more important than the other. However, learners should strive to develop both skills simultaneously to become proficient in English and improve their employability and career prospects.",1
"There is much to be said for having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Not only does this allow you to be more versatile and employable in the future, but it also allows you to have a more in-depth understanding of certain issues and perspectives.

One example of this can be seen in the field of history. It is often argued that having broad knowledge of many historical periods and events will allow you to have a more nuanced understanding of complex historical contexts. In turn, this will allow you to make more informed and insightful arguments and perspectives.

Additionally, having a well-rounded knowledge of many academic disciplines can also be advantageous in the field of research. By having a better understanding of different research methodologies and tools, you will be better prepared to undertake original and innovative research projects.

Overall, it is generally argued that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is both beneficial and advantageous. While it is important to have a focus in one or two specific areas of study, it is also beneficial to have a more general understanding of many different areas of study.",1
"I will agree the statement that Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. However, I do not agree that successful people are always risk takers. For example, a successful person may not be willing to take a chance on a new product or service because they know that it will not succeed. In this case, the person is not a risk taker. Instead, they are an experienced or successful person who has learned from their mistakes and has a good idea of what works and what does not work.

What is your definition of success? How do you define success for yourself and others? What is the difference between success and success in your life? I believe that success can be defined in a number of different ways, but the most important thing to remember is that a person's success is determined by how well they do in the areas of their life that are important to them. Success in my life is defined by the success of my business, my family, and my friends. If I am successful in any of these areas, then I have achieved success. I think it is important for people to understand that there is no such thing as success in life. There is only what you do with your time and your energy and the results that you get from your efforts. The only way to be successful is to work hard and do the things that make you happy.",1
"In the past two decades, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of cars on the road. In fact, the number of cars in use has nearly doubled. However, in the next twenty years, we will see a decrease in the number of cars in use. There are several reasons for this.

First, the cost of owning and operating a car will continue to increase. The price of gasoline is already high and is expected to continue to rise. In addition, the cost of maintenance and repairs will also increase. As cars become more complex, it will become more expensive to keep them running.

Second, the number of people who can afford to own a car will decrease. The current economic recession has caused many people to lose their jobs and their homes. As a result, they will no longer be able to afford to own a car.

Third, the number of people who live in urban areas will continue to increase. More and more people are moving to cities where they can take advantage of public transportation. In addition, many cities are making it easier to get around without a car. For example, many cities are now offering bike-sharing programs.

Fourth, the number of young people who are getting driver’s licenses will decrease. In the past, nearly all teenagers got their driver’s licenses as soon as they turned 16. However, today, many teenagers are delaying getting their licenses. Some teenagers are choosing to wait until they are 18 or even 21.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years. The cost of owning and operating a car will continue to increase. The number of people who can afford to own a car will decrease. The number of people who live in urban areas will continue to increase. The number of young people who are getting driver’s licenses will decrease.",1
"Facial Action Coding System or also known as FACS is a new and revolutionary technology that can recognice emotions. This new technology was invented by Dr. Huang. Dr. Huang created this amazing tehnology so people would know how others are feeling so they can get help. He even goes and says that it could be use in cumpter classes. So would it be a good idea?

The answers is yes. Now the reasons i think its a good idea its because it can help the student to actually enjoy what they are learning . So the reason that i can help the student is because if they feel bored in classroom the computer would notice and it would take action, for instance it could change the lesson. And that is what Dr. huang predicts as in the paragragh he says Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor . So that is why i beileve it would be a great idea for those computer classes.

In conclusion Facs is a great technology that should be use to help others and to know how they are feeling. Because as we just saw this is something that is usefull and that it could help. Human communication is nonverbal and that includes emotional communication that's why this piece of technolgy could be and will be usefull.",0
"Japan is a lively and beautiful country with plenty of culture and attractions for visitors to explore. One of the most iconic sights are the blossom trees that bloom for a brief two week period in the spring. The country is awash with a sea of pink and white petals as the sakura, or cherry blossom, trees provide a stunning display of nature's beauty. 

For a more lively experience, a trip to one of the many bustling Japanese markets is a must. From the Akihabara district of Tokyo, to the bustling stalls of Osaka's Tenjinbashi-suji Shopping Street, these shopping paradises feature a wide range of items from fresh produce to electronics. Not only can visitors find the perfect souvenir, but the crowded aisles filled with people provides a real glimpse of the Japanese spirit.",1
"The blinking lights glared at the dark oak table, reflecting off the recently polished wood. Green fabric laid on the table, freshly glued on. Red and black cards stood at the edges, ready to attack. All around, slot machines went off.

Ka-ching

! 3 near jackpots, but none getting the big prize. Leather wallets wore nothing except worn-down receipts and old gum wrappers, the green cash flying away ages ago. At a table, a man named Generic_Name sat down. He only had 100 dollars left in his wallet. Earlier, in a fit of rage, he ran to the casino, thinking of all the money he would earn. Only thinking of the jackpot, he started playing blackjack. Generic_Name pushed in half of his earnings. The dealer passed him his 2 cards. A 7 of clubs and an 8 of diamonds. 15. Hit, he said. The dealer passed him one more card. A king of hearts. Generic_Name groaned in frustration, slamming his hand against the table. He yelled, Again! Again! He pushed in the rest of his money, eyes burning with rage. The dealer passed him 2 new cards, a 5 of hearts and a 9 of hearts. 14. Hit! the man yelled angrily. The dealer passed him a king of diamonds. Tough luck, the dealer said. Generic_Name dropped his cards on the table and stormed off. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to see multiple views, lets them know the benefits and downsides, and allows them to see the different outcomes.

First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to see multiple views. Imagine a couple fighting about money spending. The husband yells, You always spend hundreds of dollars every week for no reason! The wife, too scared to say anything, runs upstairs. In reality, the wife used the money for a local food bank, but she was too scared that the husband would be mad at her. These fights happen everyday, and if someone knew their opponent's view in a fight, then tons of fights could've been prevented. When you are struggling with a decision, you can usually only see your side. If you ask another person, they can tell you what is really happening and not just your perspective.

Next, seeking multiple opinions can also help someone make a better choice because it lets them see the benefits and downsides. Imagine a graduate fresh out of high school, trying to make a decision about where they will go to college and what they will do in life. He knows that surgeons make a crazy amount of money, so he decides to go into surgery without knowing anything about it. He doesn't know that college is crazy expensive, or that he has to go to school for 12 years, or that surgery is not an easy job. All he can think about is the money he thinks he will earn. Odds are, he will give up before he reaches the end. When you come across a decision, you usually only see the benefits of a choice. If you ask other people, then they can let you see the downsides of the choice you were going to make and the benefits of other choices.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to see all of the outcomes. Imagine a high school football player that can't decide whether or not he should play another season of football. If he plays another season, then he will get to do something he loves and he will get good grades. If he doesn't play then he won't be able to do what he loves but he would still get good grades. In reality, he would only get good grades if he stopped playing. When faced with a choice on your own, your own opinions cloud your judgment. It makes you think that if you choose a specific choice, then something else will happen. It doesn't always work that way, and other people can help you see that.

Generic_Name sat down at the table in his dining room, a grin resting on his face. On the table laid plates and bowls of different sizes and colors. On each different bowl lay a different soup or salad. On one there was a salad that looked like it had captured the rainbow, and on another there was a salad with lettuce that was the deepest green he had ever seen. Sandwiches stood on every plate, all changing in variety. On a blue plate there was a sandwich with the ripest cheese and on another there was brown ham that was charred just enough at the edges. It all looked like a food commercial with rows and rows of food. Kids, get down here! Dinner is ready! Generic_Name shouted. Upstairs you could hear bubbly laughter coming from Generic_Name's two children. His kids rushed downstairs, and Generic_Name's wife came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. I'm so proud of you, she said. The kids got to the dining room and their mouths were wide in shock. You made us a feast, Dad! one of them said. Generic_Name nodded in response. Yes, yes I did. It had been over 3 years since Generic_Name had last gambled. He had gotten care from his family and he had realized that gambling rarely had benefits, its outcome was usually negative, and that everyone around him was hurting because of it. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to see multiple views, lets them know the benefits and downsides, and lets them see the different outcomes.",0
"I disagree with you. In twenty years, the number of cars in use will be the same or even greater than it is today. 

There are a number of reasons why this is likely to be the case. Firstly, the number of people in the world is growing, so there will be more people who need to get around. Secondly, the technology behind cars is continuing to improve, so they are getting more fuel efficient and driver-friendly. And finally, the cost of owning a car is continuing to increase, making it less affordable for more and more people to use them.

All of these factors are likely to lead to a rise in the number of cars on the road in twenty years' time. So, I believe that you will be wrong in your prediction, and that the number of cars in use will be greater than it is today.",1
"Cars are manufactured. They were designed to be put on this earth and be used by responsible drivers. Having no cars as a safeguarded transportable vehicle is like having your dices tossed on the dirt and you can't predict what you have. It's not define as smart decisions, this is considered by opinions. Individuals have dissimilar opinions on driving, whether it is dangerous to get behind the wheel or that it should be outlawed. Most can agree with the Mobile World Congress in the executive chairman, Bill Ford. His proper approach is to plan a business plan for a world that consider personal vehicle ownership is undesirable so they can put down emissions so it can improve safety. I don't buy it. Rejecting car culture is certainly the dumbest alternative decisions that anyone has to make. To provide reasonings to my strong point, brings me back to paragraph 36. It clearly states in bolded writing: ''With all these changes, people who stopped cars commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit....'' Furthermore, the demographic shifts in the driving population have strong trend that I can agree with. When you are fifteen, you can partake on the written and reading portion of driving and as you study your way to reach your goal, you get your permit. As you ascend your way into the online session and the real world test, you'll find yourself receiving a license as your ticket of permission to be behind the wheel by the law and by the state. Car ownership turnmoil is documented and caputred by the state due to it's nonfundamental implications that's truly not beneficial to those who rely on taking responsiblity for their actions. But if the decrease in measures that can be jotted down on paper proves that you have overestimated your duties and perogative that will not be catergorically denied before a state court or driving school. Once you lose your vehicle, it's not about banning the driving, this is about how to teach the driver on how can he or she be better the next time. Taking away driving privileges and sorts of public transportation will ease it's way to find itself in a world where nothing will be run by anyone.",0
"Should students graduate earlier from high school? Graduation earlier have been the choice that a lot of students on make on their lives. They may feel over-confident when they are clear about what are their accomplishments and the things that they have to do to reach it. It is not that easy as it sounds because they need to prepared themselves and notify that it will be difficult to reach their goals. However at the end they will see that was for a good and valuable things for their lives. They might will need to work hard and feel like to exceed themselves. It is good idea to graduate earlier because students will have the opportunity to find a job after they graduate and earn money then later they can start going college, they will be more productive in society, and they will develop their skills and knowledge.

Students that graduate earlier need to have enthusiasm and know that they will have a more difficult life and realize that they will have more responsibilities and duties in society, when they are out of school they should take that as an advantage to use their time wisely and help themselves by trying to find a job and earn some money; if they are taking the decision to go to college in few years. It is hard to find a job when the time pass and they did not practice all the things that they learn in the past and then realize that they should do sometime productive same as when they were in high school before they graduate.

In addition they will be helping their parents same as they did it when they were in school, by supporting and care about of them, they will be contributing in home and society. Also, they will have others accomplishments that they might want to reach it and celebrate with their families and make them feel proud and happy of their goals. Understanding that all the things that they did are for have good benefits and others people will used as good thing to defend or help themselves.

Finally, all students have the same capacity to show up and do the right things, after they graduate they have the opportunity to find a job and demonstrate how the develop their skills and knowledge. Staying positive and knowing that they can do great and specials things will make them feel proud of their works and then they will prove that they can do amazing things like everybody does. Providing high qualities of themselves in a workplace can help them to know and find new information about what things are happening in the world that round them.

Students should be thinking what they want do in their future or after high school since when they are growing up because that will help them to clear their minds and thoughts. Working hard and doing it with enthusiasm that is how they will be success in their future. Earning money by working honestly later that will be a big step to start a career in college, helping people and communities will make them feel more productive and helping their attitudes to stay confident, brave, and strong all the time with themselves,demonstrating their abilities and capacities is how they will be success in their futures lives.",0
"The Face on Mars is a natural landform because of three things, one, the picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Two, shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Three, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows.

The picture actually shows is the martian epuivalent of a butte or mesa. Landforms common around the Armerican West. Which shows that landforms on mars are just the same as on Earth. That means that there aren't aliens formations on cause there is no alien formations on Earth.

The rock formation's shadows gave an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The formation resembles a human head. The shadows made it look like a face. Scientists said that is was a mesa, with unusaual shadows.

Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows. The rock formation gave off shadows form its incaved areas. The shadows made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

"There is no doubt that intellectual curiosity is a powerful force that drives people to explore and discover new ideas. Whether it is a passion for science, literature, or the arts, the pursuit of intellectual interests can lead to profound insights and discoveries that benefit not only the individual but also society as a whole. While some argue that people who act for the public good are more likely to make a difference, I believe that those who pursue their own intellectual interests for purely personal reasons are just as likely, if not more so, to contribute to the betterment of the world.

One reason why people who pursue their own intellectual interests are more likely to benefit the rest of the world is that they are driven by a genuine passion for their subject matter. When people are motivated by their own curiosity and love of learning, they are more likely to produce work that is innovative and impactful. For example, many of the greatest scientific discoveries in history were made by individuals who were driven by their own intellectual curiosity, such as Marie Curie, who discovered radioactivity, and Albert Einstein, who formulated the theory of relativity. These individuals were not motivated by a desire to help others, but rather by a deep fascination with the mysteries of the universe.

Another reason why people who pursue their own intellectual interests are more likely to benefit the rest of the world is that they are free to explore ideas that might not be considered popular or mainstream. When people are not bound by the constraints of public opinion or the demands of others, they are free to explore new ideas and perspectives that might not be accepted by society at large. For example, many of the greatest works of literature and art were produced by individuals who were not afraid to challenge the status quo, such as James Joyce's Ulysses or Pablo Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. These works were not created with the intention of serving the public good, but rather as a means of exploring new forms of expression and pushing the boundaries of what was considered acceptable.

Finally, people who pursue their own intellectual interests are more likely to make a lasting impact on the world because their work is not tied to any particular agenda or ideology. When people are motivated by a desire to serve the public good, they are often constrained by the particular goals and objectives of the organizations or causes they are working for. This can limit their ability to think creatively and produce truly original work. On the other hand, individuals who are pursuing their own intellectual interests are free to explore any topic or idea that captures their imagination, without being tied to a particular agenda or ideology. This can lead to truly groundbreaking work that has the potential to change the world.

In conclusion, while it is certainly admirable to work for the public good, I believe that people who pursue their own intellectual interests for purely personal reasons are just as likely, if not more so, to benefit the rest of the world. When people are driven by their own curiosity and passion, they are more likely to produce work that is innovative and impactful, and they are free to explore new ideas and perspectives that might not be accepted by society at large. Ultimately, it is the pursuit of knowledge and understanding that drives progress and leads to a better world for all.",1
"In today's age of growing technological advancement, it is becoming increasingly important to be mindful of online security. Many of us use the internet daily for things such as banking and shopping, but with this usage often comes risk. Cybersecurity involves protecting digital information and computer systems from theft or damage caused by hackers or malicious software. While most people are aware that they should take steps to ensure their personal data remains secure, many don’t properly understand how to do so. This essay will outline some practical tips on how individuals can safeguard themselves against potential cyber threats and maintain a safe online environment. One key way in which users can protect themselves is through strong passwords; these should contain at least eight characters with a combination of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols whenever possible. It is also best practice to change passwords regularly; at least once every two months is recommended in order to deter hackers from gaining access your accounts or data stores over long periods of time. One further tip would be to never use the same password for multiple accounts – if one account were compromised then other services could potentially become vulnerable too unless different passwords are used across all sites visited online. Another step for increasing user security would be installing malware protection programs on computers and phones; these types of applications act like an extra layer between you and any malicious attempts made by external entities looking to cause harm either via stealing identities or damaging devices/networks connected together digitally. Firewalls are another great tool available when it comes to warding off unwelcome intrusions into private networks as well; these block suspicious traffic coming into the system thereby providing extra protection against phishing attacks or viruses attempting entry into otherwise secure areas within the system architecture itself (this includes both hardware components & software solutions). Finally - always exercise caution when opening email attachments or clicking links sent by unknown sources as doing so may result in exposing yourself unknowingly towards potential risks associated with downloading malicious content onto your device",1
"Everyone has dreamed about aliens living on mars at least once in their life. As exciting as it would be to discover living beings on mars, there is no evidnece today that would support that theory. Here at NASA, we have been debating this topic for more than thirty years. The Face could not have been created by aliens because there are no alien markings and there are landforms very similar to the Face here on Earth.

When analyzing a digital image, you can dicern things 3 times larger than the actual pixel size. If aliens had created the Face, there would be some kind of marking that the aliens would have made. On our 2001 trip to the big red planet, we used our best cameras with their absolute maximum resolution. The images that we took showed no sign of any martian markings. This proves that aliens could not have created the Face on Mars.

Here on Earth we have many different types of landforms. One of which looks very similar to the Face on Mars. This landform is called a Mesa. These landforms here weren't created by living beings. They were created by natural causes, like erosion. So, since the landforms here weren't made by creatures, why would the landform on Mars have been made by creatures? There is no evidence that proves the Face could have been created by alien life forms.

In conclusion, although everyone here on Earth would love to discover that the Face was created by aliens, there is no evidence that can prove that theory. There are not any alien markings and there are landforms on Earth that look very similar to the Face on Mars.",0
"In the current digital age, online activities, such as shopping, playing games, and connecting with people on social media sites, have revolutionized the way in which groups of people interact. There are numerous potential benefits of engaging with these activities, such as the ease of access to people outside of your geographical area or the ability to purchase items without leaving your house. However, it is also important to consider the risks associated with partaking in these activities as well; for example, scams, identity theft, and digital addiction. 

We live in a world where staying connected is becoming increasingly important; however, with these connections come some important caveats. Undoubtedly, it can be beneficial to remain digitally connected with the world and have access to others’ insights and opportunities, however, it is also crucial to keep in mind that not everyone needs to know all the information about other people. Maintaining the boundaries between private and public information can be difficult in our current online-focused culture, and therefore requires dedicated effort in order to do so. Thus, it is important to remain connected with the digital world, in order to keep up with the changing times, while also establishing limits on just how much time and energy are put into these activities.",1
"When people ask for advise, they usually don't know what path or choice to make.

When people make a wrong desition they can mess something up in their life. That can mean the world to them like a wife/husban or his/her kids. They can set a bad influence on small kids by going to jail or by doing something a criminal might do. That is why most people go to jail and don't come out for a very long long time. That sucks to not see your mom/dad for a very long time and that can be depressing on some people.

Then if they make a good choice they won't get in trouble or get in federal trouble. that can make a good influence on your childeren and that can give them a better futer in this world. If you talk to the right person that gives you good advise. That can be a very good choice for you and your family because they won't have to see you in jail through a little window.

Just what im saying is if you mess up by talking to the wrong person you can set a bad influence on people, more family and that would suck to see your chidren and wife through a little window in a prison trust me I have been through it all. if you get in bad trouble you can probubly fix it and just get a ticket, fin, or mistimener you can fix it dont make the wrong choice and get in trouble do what you think is the best for you and your family. Don't think bout other just worry bout you and your family not anybody else

Also if you do they can take your stuff, steal money, stab you in the back and also become an turn on you, a freind is a doller in your pocket and your pocket gots a hole my mom says that to me a lot. Just do what your heart says not other people because the can get you in a lot of trouble.

This is what can go good for you, if you make the right choice you can go to college and get a degree in something you like. You can get a good job and get a good house, good car and always have money on you just in case of anything. You also can help out your perents get a good house and you won't have to put them in a home and you can also bye what your kids want when ever they wan't and you won't have to go through the bad stuff in the world like most people go through to put food on the table.",0
"Although some people might say that students should use cell phones in the classroom for education purpose. Also some people might says that cell phones can effect students study and their grades in school, and it is not a good thing for students to having their cell phones in classroom.

However, not everyone agrees with this position,because cell phones can effect students health such as eyes problems if students look at it for a long time. And it can get students interest about games or social media or app for chatting. Additionally, there might be support for this idea that cell phones can help students to search on things or information that they are looking for in class. Also cell phones can help students easily to contact with their friends at school or to call their parents in an emergency situations.

Ultimately, this argument cannot stand because cell phones can effect students scores, students might be missing something important in the class while playing with cellphones. It seems like nothing but cellphones can destroy students future. The reason this idea is fallible that students cannot focus on class if they are using cell phones in the classroom.

Given these points, students might be get addicted to cell phones and cell phones will became a bad habit for students. One possible solution to this issue might be using cell phones only for an emergency problems or education problems. some students that can control the limit of using cell phones. Students better to use cell phone in the classroom when it is necessary, but not for the game or chatting with someone else.",0
"There are some student that from a young age they have in mind of what career they want to choose i life. there some that they don not know from which career to choose from so is very important that when you enter high school you try to select a career that you would like for your future in life, but also you need to be thinking if you are going to go to college you need to start thinking about that to. some societies want student to to choose to which college there going to go to or what they want to be in life or what kind of things they make them happy or in what they are good for? many people have skill on many different things when you get to high school you will to choose something. some societies let student decide they wait until there going to graduate to see what they would like to, some choose to continue with school other choose to not go to college. so is very important that you start from younger age at seen what career you like which university you would like to go because with having something in mind you will find out why are you studying so hard what are you spending a lot of time in school

Example: if you choose what you like or what you wan to study it will be very easy for you that when you want to graduate you won't struggle to much thinking about what do i choose or what is best for me? many people don't know what they want or many people do not choose nothing they only want to graduate and get their diploma and there done, but other they fight for what they want what are capable to do or show.",0
"Making a decision can be difficult for some people which is why they choose to reach out to others for help. Asking for advice from different people can bring someone to make the best decision, feel reassured, and more confidant with their choice.

Asking for advice can force others to make the best decision in order to benefit them. When people go to others for advice they want to see all possible outcomes in order to come up with the best conclusion. When I was in elementary school I was debating whether or not I should be home schooled. However, I didn't want to make the wrong choice and regret it, so I decided to speak to my friends and family about their opinion on the matter. My previous friends that were home schooled explained all the events and activities they were able to do with all the spare time they had. Others told me I wouldn't enjoy being alone without kids my age and fall behind in class. Having all these different opinions both negative and positive I had to think about what would make me happy. After what seemed like forever, with everyone's thoughts and opinions, I had come to the conclusion that I would in fact become home schooled. Having my friends and family give me their advice and being able see all the different scenarios helped me come to the best decision I had ever made for myself. I ended up being home schooled for two years and I was doing fanominal. Not only does asking for advice from others help make the best decision for themselves but it also helps make people feel reassured.

Getting advice from your peers can provide reassurance towards others in making a big decision. People tend to stress out when there is a decision to be made since they don't want to make the wrong one and have to go through with it. When people seek advice from several people they want their opinion to match with others in order to feel reassured with their thoughts, and when people do agree with their decision they feel more comfortable and are able to relax. Last year, I was in a toxic friendship and didn't know if I should end it or if I was just overreacting. I came to the conclusion that it wasn't just me feeling this way; I discovered that my friends and family had noticed how negative and one sided our friendship was but never knew how to tell me. At school when I was with her I felt as though I was just a burden for her to carry around. Moreover, I figured out that it was long over due to end this friendship since it was too negative and unhealthy. I wanted to speak with my parents about how they would feel towards my idea. After a long conversation, my parents advised me to leave the negative situation in order to feel healthy again and be surrounded with people who love me. Due to the fact that I checked with my parents on their beliefs that matched mine I felt comfortable and reassured that I had made the correct choice. Asking for advice can provide reassurance and can also provide confidence in themselves and their beliefs.

The last thing seeking advice from others can do, is make others feel more confidant in themselves and their choices. People usually feel more confidant when others give them advice in order to come up with the best outcome since others believe in that too. In 2015 I was invited to compete for Generic_Name in Generic_City but I wasn't positive if I really wanted to go. One of friends had previously competed for them so I turned to her for advice on what a should do. Since this was my fist pageant I had no clue what to do and she offered to guide me through everything and teach me all the things I needed to know if I were to attend. After a few weeks I had finally made my answer, I was going to compete for Generic_Name! My parents both thought it was a great opportunity for me to have this experience. My friend and I practiced everyday in order for me to be at my best and give it my all. The day of the competition had arrived and I felt so nervous that I would completely mess up but was confidant i myself that I could do it. The long hours of practice with my friend had payed off and I felt prepared for my performance. Consequently, I won third place in Top Model and was overjoyed since I worked hard and earned my trophies. Due to my friend and family advising me to pursue the competition, I had the confidence to continue and go through with the pageant. Having people support your decision and actions makes you stronger and when they're advice supports your own thoughts, it makes us confidant. Receiving advice helps in many ways such as boosting confidence which positively helps everyone.

Receiving advice from others helps people make the best decision since they are able to review all possible outcomes and pick the one that suits them, feel reassured when others have the same beliefs, and are able to feel confidant when others support you and advise you in order for it to benefit you. Making a decision can be difficult for some people which is why they choose to reach out to others for help.",0
"The fae on mars is just another landform. I think this becasue there are land forms that form exactly like it on earth, and why would the government let us see pictures of it if it was an artifact from some alien civilization.

The face on mars is just a messa. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. So infact it is not an artifact of a alien civilization because there are landforms just like it on earth from domes of lava that take the shape of an isolated mesa.

If this was an actuallly conspirasy than why is it not being hidden from us. Although few scitests believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the REad Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. They did not take more pictures becasue they believed that there was some kind of alien artifact, they took mare pictures because the pictures they had from before were eighteen years old. So things on mars could have changed during those eighteen years.

After all of the proving that it was not an alien artifact there were still some skeptics. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien marking were hidden by haze. Then NASA took more pictures on a clear sunny day and used a really high pixalization to show people that if there were peryamids on mars they would be able to see them in the picture.

This just shows to prove that the face on mars is just in fact a landformation and not an alien artifact. NASA has proved many times again and again that this mestry face is not mare that just a mesa that formed on mars. Skeptics will keep tring to prove NASA wrong but there is not another logical explainization than the Face just being a landform on mars.",0
"There are a number of reasons why I disagree with the statement that traffic and housing problems in major cities would be solved by moving big companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.

For one, such a move would simply shift the problem from one location to another. Traffic congestion and housing shortages are not caused by the presence of big companies and factories in cities, but by the fact that there are simply too many people living and working in these areas. Moving these businesses to the countryside would do nothing to reduce the number of people living in cities, and so the problems of traffic and housing would simply be relocated.

Furthermore, such a move would likely have a negative impact on the economy. Cities are hubs of economic activity, and moving businesses away from them would likely lead to a decline in economic activity and job creation. This would ultimately make the problem of traffic and housing worse, not better.

In conclusion, I do not believe that moving big companies and factories to the countryside would do anything to solve the problems of traffic and housing in major cities.",1

"Almost every single citizen in the United States of America has experienced riding in a car. And for most people, they have to have a car in order to make a living. This comes with many conciquences as well. For one, car accidents happen everywhere leading to major car insurance payments, injuries, and even death. Another downfall of having cars is all the traffic and pollution they cause to the enviornment. What if there was a society in which cars are banned? the only way of transportation is biking, walking, skateboarding, etc. That would be a lot heathier wouldnt it? Well in the city of Vauban, they did just that.

To start things off, car accidents are a huge crisis in which almost every country faces. Driving a car puts many things at risk including your life. Many people are severely injured as well causing issues for their life. Having limited car use would save thousands of lives and lower the amount of peoples lives lost from cars. If everybody walked and rode bycicles, nobody would get hurt!

This brings me to my next point. Using cars means polluting the air and expecting traffic. With no cars, your community wouldnt have to pay for stop lights, huge highways, and many other things the community must pay for in order to have access to vehicles. Also, cars pollute the air dramatically. Keeping the earth is very important and by using cars, all we are doing is hurting the earth we live on. People wouldnt have to buy gas and things would be much cheaper and cleaner without them.

This brings me to my last point. If everyone walked and rode bikes and man powered things, everyone would be a lot healthier. people would be forced to get outside and get exercise in order to go anywhere. Less people would be out of shape and people would be much happier. People would also socialize a lot more and everybody would know everbody. There would be less strangers and you would be closer to your community you live in.

To wrap things up, limiting car use would be very benificial to society for many reasons. One, there would be no car acciedents and this would save peoples lives. Two, without cars, there would be no pollution and no traffic issues at all. And three, without cars, people would be much healthier and socialize a lot more than they do with cars. All in all, a life without cars would be extreamly beneficial to the community and everyone would be much happier.",0
"The Challenge Of Exploring Venus is worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents because Venus is nicknamed Evening star because it is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky. For people who gaze at the stars at night can spot the bright light in the sky. Venus is the second planet to the sun, it is safe to watch it from the distance from our world becuase its very far, but going close to it is a challenge.

Venus the second planet close to the sun is a very dangerous planet to get close to. it is sometimes called the earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth too. All the planets move in different speeds, the diffrences in speed means sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Sometimes Venus is right around the corner in space terms human have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped planet. Each spacecraft couldnt land there for more than a few hours, maybe that explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus yet in more than three deacdes.

"Introduction:
Hey there! Have you heard about the Face on Mars? Some people believe it was created by aliens. But let me tell you, that's just not true! The Face is actually a natural landform, and I'm here to tell you why.

Body:
First of all, the Face is just a hill on Mars that looks like a face because of the shadows. As the article says, The Face on Mars, located in the Cydonia region, is a flat-topped hill with two distinctive features that give it the appearance of eyes. The article also says that the Face is made up of two symmetrical lobes that look like eyes because of the shadows. But just because something looks like a face doesn't mean it was created by aliens!

Secondly, scientists have studied the Face for years, and they've found that it's completely natural. The article says that the Face on Mars is thought to have been formed by a combination of geological processes, including erosion, deposition, and plate tectonics. That means that the Face was created by natural forces, not aliens!

Lastly, the article also says that the Face is not even a unique landform. There are similar landforms on Earth and even on other planets! For example, the Face on Mars bears a striking resemblance to the Mesozoic era dinosaur, the Triceratops. That means that the Face is just a normal part of how planets form, and it's not some strange alien creation.

Conclusion:
So there you have it! The Face on Mars is just a natural landform, not some alien creation. It's important to remember that just because something looks interesting or unusual, it doesn't mean it was created by aliens. Scientists have studied the Face for years, and they've found that it's completely natural. So next time someone tells you that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, you can tell them the truth – it's just a normal part of our solar system!",1
"Many successful individuals have triumphed despite innumerable failures. Take the famous basketball player Michael Jordan for example. Despite being cut from his high school basketball team, he remained enthusiastic and kept practicing until he moved forward and eventually became one of the best in the world. His skill techniques, knowledge of the game, and his hard work and dedication were the factors that enabled him to achieve success. 

It is essential to never give up and stay enthusiastic despite whatever struggles may occur. These qualities can help anyone achieve anything, even those individuals who may have felt that their ultimate goals and dreams were impossible. For example, if an individual can focus on learning each failure, then develop a method or strategy to attain success, he/she can conquer any challenge that they might encounter. As long as a person stays focused and focused on their own enthusiasm, they will continue to try and have an optimistic outcome.

Michael Jordan’s story is a great demonstration of how success can still be achieved despite failure. His determination and enthusiasm allowed him to change non-believers into believers and to achieve success. His example shows that success is possible, and that no matter how many times failure occurs, success can still be accomplished by channeling enthusiasm and never giving up.",1
"Working in a group can be more advantageous than working alone in many ways. By collaborating together, group members can share ideas, thoughts, and resources to create more comprehensive and creative solutions that may be less achievable individually. Working in a group can also include bouncing ideas off one another so members can identify any potential issues and provide helpful feedback and direction. Furthermore, group members are often more motivated and energized to work together, making the task more enjoyable than working alone. Lastly, shared accountability ensures that tasks are completed in a timely and effective manner, leading to better results than what could be achieved alone.",1
"I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. Facts can be learned from a book or from a teacher, but it is much more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts behind the information. For example, if a student is studying math, it is important for them to understand the concepts behind addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Understanding these concepts will help them to understand math problems and to solve them correctly.

Another example of why it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts can be seen in the world of science. In science, students are taught about the principles of physics, chemistry, and biology. These principles are based on ideas, and without understanding these ideas, students will not be able to understand or understand the concepts behind the science they are studying.

In conclusion, I believe that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts behind the information they are learning, rather than just learning the facts. This is because, without understanding the concepts, students will not be able to understand the information, and they will have difficulty solving math problems or understanding science concepts.",1
"Gardening is a great way to relax and connect with nature, but it can also provide an opportunity to learn about the environment. Gardening teaches us how different plants interact with their surroundings and how they can be used to benefit our lives. It allows us to observe nature up close in our own backyards and also provides exercise, fresh air, satisfaction from creating something beautiful, and even food for ourselves or others. When starting a garden, one of the most important things we need to understand is what type of soil we have – whether that’s sandy loam or clay-based – as this will dictate what types of plants are best suited for our area. Once you’ve established your soil type, you can then begin looking into which kinds of plants would thrive in your garden space. Some factors such as sunlight exposure will affect certain plant varieties more than others so it's important to research any potential additions before planting them in your yard or container gardens. . Another aspect of gardening that should not be overlooked is pest management; certain insects are attracted to specific flowers while other pests may damage entire crops if left untreated. Fortunately there are many organic methods available for controlling these unwanted visitors including companion planting (planting certain species near each other), traps and barriers made from natural materials like wood ash or citronella candles, biological control using beneficial organisms such as ladybugs or praying mantises, and simply removing infected plants when they appear. . . Finally don't forget about harvesting! Knowing when vegetables reach maturity is key; too early means small yields while leaving them on the vine too long could mean losses due to disease or pests getting at them first! Additionally some fruits require pollination by bees in order for full ripeness so understanding their lifecycles play an integral part in successful harvests throughout the season.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen and voter, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. While there are valid arguments on both sides of this issue, I will outline several reasons why the Electoral College has merit and should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in presidential elections. It is highly unlikely for a dispute to occur over the electoral vote, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This is due to the winner-take-all system in most states, where even a small plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system reduces the likelihood of contentious disagreements over the outcome of the election.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of everyone's president by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which discourages candidates from focusing solely on specific regions. This ensures that the elected president will have a broader support base and is more likely to govern with consideration for the interests of all regions in the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This system compels politicians to pay attention to a diverse range of states and their issues instead of solely focusing on large population centers. Swing states receive increased campaign efforts and attention, allowing voters in those states to make informed decisions and have a significant impact on the outcome of the election. This focus on swing states also incentivizes thoughtful voting and engagement with the campaign by the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores a sense of balance for large states by providing them with more weight in the political process. While the Senate provides malapportionment of large states by population, the Electoral College allows presidential candidates to allocate resources and focus attention on densely populated states. This ensures that large states receive necessary attention from candidates during campaigns, regardless of the overall population disparities.

Lastly, the Electoral College effectively avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote. Instead, this system produces a clear winner by requiring the majority of electoral votes, reducing the complications and expenses associated with conducting additional voting rounds for a clear winner to emerge.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, it is worth noting that the system has worked for over two centuries and safeguarded against potential election crises. The inefficiencies experienced in several instances are outweighed by the strength and stability the Electoral College provides to the democratic process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its ability to ensure a certain outcome, promote trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, provide weight to large states, and avoid run-off elections are all compelling reasons to preserve this system. I respectfully urge you to take these factors into consideration when discussing any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust you will carefully weigh the arguments both for and against the Electoral College in your decision-making process. If you require any further information or would like to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

"Dear, State Senator

The Electoral College is a great process that was created by the founding fathers in the Constitution.The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compronise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The electoral college consistw of the electors the meeting of the electors of the voting for president and vice president. The electoral college process consists of 538 electors. When you run for president you have to get majority of the 270 electoral votes its required. Every candidate running for president has there own group of electors.Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the candidate's political party.

When the presidential election is over your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainmentits listing all of the candidates who had ran for president in your state. The certicate also says the winning presidential canddidate in your state.After the presidential election,your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.The states certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives.

The electoral college should be keeping the electoral college because its a very important process of how we choose the president. If we just put our say in the votes some people might feellike htey amde the wrong choose in the voting. And if we just let congress picl our president because thats not fair becuse this is our conutry too adn we should have a say about what the presdent gonna do or what are some of he/she plans to do for our conunty.the electoral college is widely regarded as and anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ougth to be [overruled]by decaring tht candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.

There a five reasons to keep the electoral college certainty of outcome,everyone's president,swing states,big states and lastly avoid run-off elections. It is possible for a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the popular vote. A presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.This is a desirable result appeal is unlikelu to be a suffessful president. The electoral college restores some of the weight in the balance the large states lose by virtue.

In Conclusion the elecoral college should stay becase it makes everthing fair for the electoral candaiets and so citizen of the united states have a chance to ahve a say in what they want as a president.",0
"There is no denying the role of technology in our lives today. Smartphones, computers, and other devices have become indispensable tools that are used in virtually every aspect of life, from entertainment and education to communication and commerce. While these advancements can be seen as a net positive for society, their use must also be met with caution. The increasing reliance on technology has led to problems such as information overload and cyberbullying. Information overload occurs when individuals are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of data available on the internet today; this can lead to an inability to concentrate or focus on any one task at a time. In addition, too much exposure to digital media can reduce productivity levels due to distraction from important tasks at hand. Cyberbullying is another concerning issue arising from technology use; it involves using digital platforms such as social media sites or text messaging services for harassment purposes. This type of bullying often goes unreported since it happens online rather than face-to-face interactions; however its psychological impact can be severe nonetheless, leading victims into feelings of anxiety or depression over prolonged periods of time if not addressed properly. Given how pervasive technologies have become in our daily lives, it is critical that users take proactive steps towards mitigating risks associated with digital media usage while still gaining maximum benefit out of them. It is important for parents to monitor their children’s online activity closely so they may help guard against potential dangers encountered online through proper guidance and support systems put in place beforehand if needed. Adults should also practice good safety habits like setting strong passwords for all accounts maintained across various websites ensuring that personal data remains secure at all times; additionally limiting screen time per day when possible will minimize chances of overexposure towards certain forms multimedia content which could cause added stress which might disrupt daily routines needed for efficient functioning throughout day-to-day life activities.

"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones While Operating a Vehicle

In today's world, cell phones have become an indispensable part of our daily lives. However, using a cell phone while driving a vehicle poses severe safety risks and should be prohibited. There are several reasons for this:

Firstly, driving requires a person's full attention and focus on the road. However, cell phone use divides a driver's attention between conversing/texting and navigating traffic. Numerous studies have shown that even hands-free conversations on the phone impair a driver's attention and increase risk of accidents. Holding and looking at a phone is even more distracting. This puts not only the driver but all other motorists and pedestrians at risk. 

Secondly, cell phone use slows a driver's reaction time. Being engaged in a phone conversation prevents a driver from promptly noticing and reacting to changing traffic situations like brake lights ahead. Research demonstrates reaction times are significantly delayed when using a phone versus focusing solely on driving. Slower responses could prove disastrous in emergency scenarios.

Furthermore, the fine motor skills required for texting, typing or swiping are difficult to perform safely while driving. Eyes are directed towards the phone screen instead of the road. Messages sometimes need to be re-read or corrected, prolonging the distraction. Driving requires full control of the vehicle using both hands, which is compromised by cell phone handling.

In conclusion, as tempting as it is to remain connected while on the move, cell phone use endangers lives on our roads. A small distraction can have major consequences. For the safety of all citizens, the risks of using a phone while driving outweigh any perceived benefits. Strict laws are needed worldwide to reduce distracted driving behaviors and focus minds fully on the task at hand - navigating traffic safely. Overall cell phones have no place in the driver's seat and should be banned from all vehicle operation.",1
"The debate over year-round school has been especially contentious in recent years. Supporters of year-round school argue that it provides students with more flexible scheduling, allowing them to take classes during regular summer months instead of having an extended December-March break. Additionally, they suggest that a continuous educational cycle supports learning and decreases the amount of time devoted to reviewing earlier material upon returning to school. 

Nevertheless, critics of year-round school contend that it results in teachers having greater workloads, since they are required to teach for more weeks each year. Other drawbacks include increased energy costs for schools that need to remain in operation during the summer months and decreased recreational opportunities for students who are occupied with school instead of enjoying summer activities with their classmates. 

Alternatives to year-round school include extending the traditional school day for traditional school years. Schools could also look into reapportioning the longer December-March break or shifting towards a four-day school week. Lastly, summer break offers students the opportunity to attain further academic progress and even available internships, as well as the chance to relax. Summer break allows students the opportunity to engage in activities that help them relax and view learning in a different light—which in turn can make learning more enjoyable.",1
"Nowadays, computer games have become one of the most popular activities among children. Some people, however, think that their effects on children are more negative than positive. While I can see their point, I don't agree with them.

There are several reasons why computer games are beneficial to children. Firstly, they help children improve their physical skills. For example, many action games require players to move around quickly and respond quickly to on-screen prompts, which helps children become more agile and coordinated. Secondly, computer games help children improve their intellectual skills. For instance, strategy games require players to think ahead and plan their moves, which helps children develop problem-solving skills. Finally, computer games can help children boost their self-confidence. For example, racing games allow children to compete against others and achieve high scores, which makes them feel good about themselves.

While computer games have many benefits, they also have a few negative effects. Firstly, computer games can lead to obesity, as children can often spend hours sitting in front of the screen. Secondly, computer games can lead to addiction, as some children become so obsessed with gaming that they neglect their school work and social life.

In conclusion, while computer games have some negative effects, I believe that the positives outweigh the negatives. I would therefore encourage parents to allow their children to play computer games, but to set limits on how much time they can spend on them.",1
"Explanatory Essay: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage is a concept that is gaining popularity in various parts of the world. As discussed in the passages, there are numerous advantages to restricting the use of cars, both for individuals and for the environment. This essay will delve deeper into these advantages and illustrate why limiting car usage can be a beneficial approach.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, we can drastically reduce these emissions and contribute to tackling the global issue of climate change. This approach aligns with the goals outlined by President Obama to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passages discuss how the smog in Paris and Bogota prompted driving bans, resulting in reduced congestion and pollution. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, walking, or cycling, we can significantly improve the air quality in cities. This is particularly important in densely populated areas where air pollution can have detrimental effects on public health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential reduction in traffic congestion. In cities like Vauban, Germany, where car usage is limited, there is less dependence on cars, and the streets are significantly less crowded. This can lead to smoother traffic flow and less time wasted in traffic jams. Additionally, reducing congestion can also result in fewer accidents and improved overall road safety.

Limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on urban planning and the design of communities. As discussed in the passages, the concept of smart planning involves creating suburbs that are more accessible to public transportation and have less emphasis on parking spaces. This shift allows for the allocation of space to alternative modes of transportation and the development of more pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, with amenities such as stores located within walking distance.

Moreover, limiting car usage can bring about behavioral changes in individuals. As the passages suggest, younger generations are becoming less interested in car ownership and more open to alternative transportation options. This shift in mindset can lead to a decrease in car dependence and a greater emphasis on sustainable modes of transportation. It can also pave the way for the development of innovative solutions such as car-sharing programs and advancements in public transit networks.

In conclusion, there are several benefits to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to alleviating traffic congestion and promoting sustainable urban planning, the advantages are significant for both individuals and the environment. As more cities and communities embrace this approach, we can work towards creating a future that is less reliant on cars and more focused on sustainable and efficient transportation alternatives.",1
"As the world becomes more accessible, travel is becoming increasingly popular. However, the question of how to travel is still up for debate. Some people prefer to travel alone, while others prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. In my opinion, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are several reasons why I believe this.

Firstly, a tour guide can provide valuable information about the places you are visiting. They can share interesting facts, historical information, and cultural insights that you might not be able to find on your own. For example, when I visited the Great Wall of China, my tour guide explained the history of the wall and it's significance in Chinese culture. Without her knowledge, I would not have been able to fully appreciate the experience.

Secondly, traveling in a group can be safer than traveling alone. A tour guide can help you navigate unfamiliar places, avoid dangerous areas, and provide assistance in case of an emergency. Additionally, traveling in a group can deter thieves and other criminals who might target solo travelers.

Thirdly, traveling in a group can be more enjoyable than traveling alone. You can share experiences with others, make new friends, and have someone to talk to during long journeys. Additionally, a tour guide can help you plan activities and make the most of your time in a particular destination. For example, when I visited Paris with a tour group, our guide helped us navigate the city and recommended the best places to eat and shop.

Of course, there are some downsides to traveling in a group led by a tour guide. For example, you might have less flexibility in terms of your itinerary and less control over your schedule. Additionally, you might have to deal with other people's preferences and personalities, which can be challenging at times.

However, I believe that the benefits of traveling in a group led by a tour guide outweigh the drawbacks. By having a knowledgeable guide, you can learn more about the places you are visiting, stay safe, and have a more enjoyable experience overall. So, if you are planning a trip, I would highly recommend considering a group tour with a knowledgeable guide.",1
"There are quite a few advantages in limiting car usage. You may think thats a very silly idea but honestly you have no idea. lets look at the bright side of this. If we limit car usage there will be less money waste, because you wont have to worry about spending your money on gas. Instead you can use it for something more valuable. Also in the article they mention this...Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden inthis experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. They dont really even use the cars so why have them if to some people in French they are useless.

Also as a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter, a media trainerand mother of two. So now i know that not everyone needs a car most people dont. They think that us having only taxi's and busses things would be a better community and society to us, but i disagree. We wouldn't be able to get from one place to another as fast as we can, because of how there are people going everywhere to different places. So im glad we dont have only busses and taxi's.

In the United States, the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting car reduce communities, and legislators are starting to act,if cautiosuly. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. Can yall believe that for the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. Meaning they are for getting rid of cars. Also as of Apirl 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995, Part of the explination is because Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemplyed weren't going to work anyway.

New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation. Also a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...thats crazy to think about that now we are in 2014 and i believe that number has most likely gone up. We need to fix it as soon as we can to prevent harm to our sociecty, because the younger ones have more reckless drivers than the older ones, and adults.

Finally, those are my reason and my explinations on why i think cars should stop because of the harm to our community and how we should start using bikes or even walk from point a to point be,or use the busses either one will safe us the gas mopney for example. Also it would prevent less deaths because there wouldn't be so many cars all together at once",0
"Duke Ellington's famous quote A problem is a chance to do your best serves to remind people that stumbling blocks can often be opportunities to put our best efforts forward and rise to the occasion. I've applied this lesson in a variety of situations. 

In terms of sports, I’ve regularly faced physical setbacks due to a weak ankle. Despite being discouraged at first, I’ve taken Ellington’s advice to heart and worked extra hard on strengthening it to assure I don’t miss out on any opportunity to compete.

This quote has also inspired me to take a hands-on approach to tackling tough challenges in school. For instance, when I struggled to memorize a math formula, I chose to focus on what I needed to learn and spent additional time on drilling the material until I was confident I had mastered it. 

Also, issues between family members are difficult to resolve, but I’ve used this philosophy to work through our conflicts with kindness and understanding. For example, when there was a disagreement between my brother and I about how to split the chores, rather than arguing, I immediately looked for the most fitting solution that everyone could live with and that achieved the best outcome possible. 

By analyzing Duke Ellington's quote, it's evident that it instills a sense of positivity and strength even when obstacles arise. It reminds us to remain resilient and provides an opportunity to showcase our best abilities.",1
"Seeking multiple opinions is beneficial when making choices because it helps you get a better understanding of the situation. When you talk to different people, you receive diverse perspectives, insights and suggestions about the problem which can assist you to make a better decision.

For example, if you are considering which school to enroll in, speaking to your parents, your current teacher, and your friends can help you weigh the pros and cons of each school. Your parents can provide guidance on the academic programs, your current teacher can share insights into your academic strengths and weaknesses, and your friends can give you an idea of the social environment and extracurricular activities.

Another example is when you are deciding on a career path. Talking to people in different professions can provide valuable information and help you make an informed decision. You can ask them questions about the work environment, daily tasks, educational requirements, and job prospects.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is an effective way to make well-informed decisions. It helps you gather different perspectives on the same subject, which can help you weigh the advantages and disadvantages and make a better choice.",1
"There are many times where you might need to make an important choice, but you don't know what to do; so, you seek advice from individuals you know. Asking for people's opinions when you're unable to make a decision happens often to many people; whether, it's the smallest of things or the biggest. It can be like asking your friend what to wear to the party on Friday or consulting with your teachers and family on which college to attend to. However, it's always preferred that you ask advice from numerous people. Seeking advice from multiple individuals is crucial so you can hear multiple opinions and views about your problem, and it will assist you to making the best choice possible by having reliable opinions and choices.

Asking for different people's advice can help you seek varying solutions and options to help you make a decision. To know all the pros and cons about the choice your making, you'll need to hear a variety of views and opinions from different people, so you can also avoid all bias. When I was picking out my high school electives I didn't know whether to quit French and start learning Arabic or to continue French. At the time, I had to conference with my counselor, discuss it with my parents, and even ask my friends for their opinions. Seeking all those differing opinions helped me consider all possible choices and outcomes. In the end, after I had asked everyone for advice I agreed with most of them that I should't quit learning French, as most said that I should do the class that I liked best and that was French class. In conclusion it's smarter to seek multiple opinions in order to know all the possible choices you can make and the consequences of them.

Another reason why you should seek different opinions is so you can pick the best advice by having multiple sources and people's views to rely on. Sometimes listening to only one person might not be as beneficial for many reasons; they might of had never experienced with the situation you're dealing with, they may be uninformed, and of course they can be biased. For example, asking your fellow friend for advice for a class project even though they're not the most attentive in class nor are they amazing with projects might not be the safest of ideas. However, if you were to ask your teacher and a other fellow classmates you can hear their advice for how to improve your project for class and have reliable opinions. In the end, you should ask numerous people for their advice, so you can pick the most logical choice.

Overall It's beneficial to ask for multiple individuals for their advice for a problem instead of just one person, since you can take in all possible choices and options and know their consequences, and so you can obtain numerous reliable opinions to make the perfect choice for your problem. Asking different people for advice can help you hear about a variety of information; and you can even come across new ideas that you never thought about. You can also ensure that you can hear from different sources and hear the most accurate of advice to make the best choice possible. To sum it up the next time when asking for advice for a personal issue or a choice you have to make, try asking different people and see what they have to say about it.",0
"There is no single answer to this question as it depends on the individual. Some young people may enjoy life more than older people, while others may not. However, there are some reasons why young people may enjoy life more than older people.

First, young people are typically more optimistic than older people. They tend to see the world in a more positive light and are less likely to be discouraged by setbacks. This can make life more enjoyable, because it is less stressful and more fulfilling.

Second, young people are typically more active than older people. They are more likely to participate in sports, social activities, and other pursuits that make them happy. This can add to their enjoyment of life.

Finally, young people are typically more engaged with the world around them. They are more interested in what is happening and are more likely to be involved in their community. This engagement can make life more fulfilling and enjoyable.

Overall, there are several reasons why young people may enjoy life more than older people. This does not mean that older people do not enjoy life, but it is typically more enjoyable for young people.",1
"For decades, society has put a major emphasis on transportation in order to center themselves around cars and ways to upgrade them. However, it is this frame of that mind that has created issues for modern society. If there were limitations put on the usage of cars, then those rules would help maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create a feeling of bliss and serenity that has disappeared since the mass production of cars. So unless change is brought upon society, then people will be passing up on benefits that would better the whole world.

Scientist have long realized that cars are a major cause to the pollution brought into society. From the waste produced while turning precious oil into gasoline, to the engines in millions of cars simultaneously burning gas. It is for this reason that limiting the use of cars would assist in saving and maintaining the environment. According to Robert Duffer, the author of the article Paris Bans Driving Due to Somg, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog. What is also noteworthy is that this experiment by France officials was only in place for a matter of days. So after having smog that repotedly rivaled Beijing, China, the smog capital of the world, the smog that inhabited France was more than cut in half. If this can work in such a large scale like France, then it isn't unreasonable to believe that this same process can be done in other major regions. Saving the environment has become a priority around the world in recent years, and the idea of limiting the usage of cars could help to achieve that goal.

Aside from the fact that the limitation of cars can save the environment, it can also save car owners money. When a person stops at a gas station to fill up their car, they can expect to spend between twenty and fifty dollars. However, if cars were to become less relevant, then this money can be used to fund other important aspects of a persons life. While this might seem farfetched, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. This analysis helps to justify the fact that cars can eventually become less relevant and thus save people money. Also, money would be saved on not having to repair and maintain a car, or having to buy a car in general. This alone can save a carowning household thousands of dollars each year.

Saving the environment and money are always an obvious choice when explaining the benefits of limiting car usage, but another benefit would be obtaining bliss and serenity around the globe. Since the mass producion of cars, cities are always filled with the irritating sounds of a lively road. This has left many people to enjoy their walks, not to the sounds of children laughing and people conversing, but to the beeping and screeching of cars. However, in a city in Germany called Vauban, officials have successfully created a peaceful city that relies on walking and public transportation instead of cars. According to Heiden Walter, a media trainer and citizen in Vauban, When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way. This quote goes to show that the citizens don't feeled resticted, but released from their reliance on cars. So although it may seem difficult, putting limitations on cars can create a happier populants.

Putting a limitation on the use of cars would not be a punishment like some would see it, but a way to better society. This limitation would help save and maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create bliss and serenity amongst people. As modern society continues to push forward and develop the next wave of advancements, putting limitations on the use of cars should be seen as a serious inquiry to leaders around the world.",0
"cars, they wernt invented in the old days. who needs them, not me. screw cars. Ill tell u what u need to know about life and transportation. We can limit car use if u just use this information and use it in your life.

paris has so much smog. Ew!!! No one likes that so lets limit car use. paris has 147 micrograms of matter in cubic meter measurement. Dang taxes! I hate soccer moms, my mom is one so i cant hate them too much. All they do is drive everywhere and use up all the resources so there kid can strike out in little leauge! Now i will tell you how to fix this problem.

if some of the stupid soccer moms driving around there rolling egg (mini van) the car use would be cut in half. Then you might say then what is my little kid going to do. You can read a biycle places just like it said in line 24 of car-free day spinning into a big hit bogota. Now ill tell you what kind of bike and what your gonna do with it and your gonna love it!

A bmx bike is what im talking about. you can transportate it to the skatepark to ride the ramps. Its really fun and i love it. Those gas using Mini vans would be off the streets and bmx bikes can take over. Think about our earth for once please.

well to conclude things up car use is oversused highly. It is mainly the soccer moms fault. To fix all the problems in the world everyone needs to get a bmx bike and go ride some dirt jumps and this world would be a happier place!!!",0
"Air polution, no money, and death, Oh my! Everywhere you go there are going to be cars. One of the most helpful and loving inventions of our time, it gets us from place to place in a short amount of time. But is getting to where you need to go faster really worth it? Money, safety, and protection to our environment all play huge roles when it comes to cars. The population of our world grows every year, which means more cars... Which means more air polution, more deaths, more of spending your money.

Owning a car also comes a lot of things. Money for gas, money for parts that stop working, etc. With gas prices up and down all the time, we find ourselves spending way too much money just to fill up our vehicle. You would be amazed at how much more money you would have if you weren't spending on gas and other things your car needs. It also requires no excercise at all, which is really a disadvantage to our health. Imagine what a simple difference can make. If we all walked or biked to where we needed to go, we're doing something great for our bodies and our environment. Not only is it jeopordizing our health, but our own environment's, too! Every single car and every single drive is polluting our air. Do we really want to end up like Beijing, China? As of now, they are known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. What about safety? Car crashes are one of the most common deaths. Such as two major factors, texting while drving and driving under the influence. No matter what state you're in, when you get behind that wheel you hold a big responsibility. So is putting your life on the line really worth it?

By limiting car usage, we can make a difference throughout the world. We can lower stress, death rate, air pollution, spendings, and so much more. If ONE day of the Day Without Cars in Columbia made a difference, imagine what a whole year, or years, could make. There are so many better options to get to where you need to go other than cars, such as bikes. So what if you don't get there as fast as you would in a car? The point is, you're still getting there. You're also not putting you and other's lives on the line. Better for the environment, better for others, better for you!",0
"There are many things to find and explore in our Solar system. What we find is used to exlain questions we have been asking for most of our lives. Exploring Venus would futher our quest for answers, that's somthing everyone can agree on. But is studying Venus worth facing all the hash conditions? The author of

The Challenge of Exploring Venus believes that is is worth it to study Venus despite its dangers; beacuse it is Earths twin, there are ways to touch ground, and it will bring many discoveries.

To begin, Venus is our sister planet or as its often reffered to Earths twin. It has the same relative desity and size as Earth. But Venus' suface is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. With the distance between Earth and Venus studying its rocks, gas or anything is relativly impossible. That is why studying Venus with people going there is ideal.

Furthermore, NASA has been working on some technology that will help humans go to Venus and benefit study. An example of this technology is stated in the passage. Some simplified electons of silicon carbon have been tsted in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's suface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. This would make it easy for someone to go down on Venus's surface. Giving them a way to collect the rocks and other samples.

Moreover, as said in the passasge,  striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value. We can lern more about what might hav lived there in years prior. We might also learn thing about Earth since they are so closely similar. Also we are more then likely to be lead in that direction. This is just a way to get closer to the future.

In conclusion, the exploration of Venus is worth it despite the dangers. Venus is Earths' twin making it another way to learn about our past. Advances in technology are working twoards getting to the surface for samples. And with those two factor we are bound to discover thing that we have no knowledge of yet. Besides at the rate we grow curious we will eventually be lead to many endeavors much like this.",0

"Cells phones are very common place for everyone to own and use on a daily basis. Cell phones are used by most people in all aspects of their lives which means even when they are operating a motor vehicle. Being distracted by cell phone use while driving can cause injuries and death. Using a cell phone while you are driving takes attention that the driver should be paying to what is going on around them. This split second of attention spent on the cell phone could cause the driver or those around them their lives. People should not use cell phones while driving.

Driving a motor vehicle requires a driver to be aware at all times of what is going on around them. They need to be able to react at a moments notice. If a driver is using a cell phone they will not be placing their full attention on driving and accidents can happen. When a driver is distracted, not only do they put their life in danger, but they also endanger the lives of those on the roads with them.

Sure a cell phone can be a good tool to use for navigational purposes, or a cell phone is great to have in the event of an emergency. The cell phone can help the driver get help quicker than they could in the past because they have instant access to a communication device. The cell phone gives its owner instant access to the Police, EMS, and Fire with the push of a couple of buttons. A cell phone can be a great tool, but it can also be a deadly one. Cell phone use should only be conducted hands free while a person is operating a vehicle in order to cut down on the distraction it can cause.",0
"I think students should come up with their own summer projects design because, students can come up with really creative projects, could have more fun doing their own design projects,and will have less stress over the summer.

Students can come up with really creative projects over summer by researching experiments, or about someones life. A student can look up science experiments to do as their projects that could be entrusting for the class or for them selves to. Also they can talk about a famous person or about someone in their family and explain why they wrote about that person. Students can invent new projects and show off to the class and explain how they came up with it and what will their invention help them or others.

Students could have more fun creating their own projects. Students will be more exited to be able to do create their own projects then follow a boring one a teacher assigned everyone. Students can come up with really creative work if you let them free roam. Students could in joy doing work that doesn't have to follow a checklist. Students could also can work on a project with their friends.

Lastly students can feel less stress about doing a project. Students will be able to work on a project without having to stress about it being perfect or if its following the checklist. Students can come up with their own checklist and show their classmates how they came up with it so the other students can do it one day for fun.

In conclusion, these our my reason why i think students should design their own summer projects.",0
"Ever wonder what is like if every one stop using their cars? Imagine how the world would be now. The earth would be clean, we dont have to be worring about the air pollution no more. Many countries are eliminating cars and making people walk to work, school and the mall or somewhere else. In Vauban, Germany every one has given up their cars, the streert parking, parking lot, and garages are forbidden. Almost everyone goes walking or they ride their bicycle. Vauban is a car-free city. Many people sold their cars to move in Vauban, so that they can live peacefuly and not be so stress over a car. Cause of this idea almost every country is starting to do this. This will help the world to be a better place.

In Paris,France, they have ban driving due to smog. Paris has been recording the pollution and they have realize that it got out of controlled. People who drives motocycle they would be fined, they would have to pay $31. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to the agency. Car traffic when down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. Diesel fuel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Paris has more smog that any other European capitals. Scientists have found that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, that is the highest compared to London and Brussels. Now the smog had cleared enough because of the car-free.

In Bogota,Colmbia, Car-Free day is spinning into a big hit. People that live in Colombia hike,bike,skate or take buses due to the Car-Free. It has been three years that Colombia have been doing these. They banned cars except buses and taxis in the capital city of 7 million people. Their goal is to remove smog and to promote alternative transportation. Colombians that dont not participate and use their car will get fined and they would have to pay $25. Carlos Artura Plaza says It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution. He rides his two-seated bike with his wife every day when they have Car-Free day. Other cities from Colombia decide to participate on this event. This campaign had started in the mid-1990s, over 118 miles of biclyce paths have been created.

In recent studies, Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes. Last yera a study was found that young people driving has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. In USA there has been a large drop in percentage of 16 to 39 years olds getting a license. In other states like New York, they have a program that you get to share bikes. If other countries satrt doing the Car-Free day campaign it will help the Earth, there wouldn't be no more smog and air pollution.",0
"When faced with a difficult task or decision its beneficial to ask for advice,but sometimes asking for help does more harm than good or leaves you with more questions than you had before. This is why when seeking advice you should always be careful,because you can't always know if the person your asking really knows what they are talking about. It isn't always lack of knowledge though it can be that that person has a bias towards one particular subject or that they want to purposefully spread misinformation. To protect yourself against this you need ask as many people as possibly in order to widen your perspective and ultimately make the best chose possible.

Firstly,asking multiple people for help on a subject is the best and only way to about seeking advice. If the first pereson you asked is off on their information you will quickly figure that out if the next people's advice is wildly different from that of the first,but this isn't always the case. For example if you were to ask all your friends if you should stay up all night playing video games with them chances are that they would say yes. Now if you ask a doctor or your parents the same question chances are that they would say no and they'd probably be correct. The point is that the majority is not always in the right a lot of the time the minority is correct so it is crucial to try to hear the perspective of different kinds of people such as different ages or ethnicity. So you do not make a mistake in your decision.

An example of a time when i made a mistake in asking advice was when i asked my friend if i should preorder a video game or not. Due to the fact that he was a huge fan of the company who made the game he couldn't say enough about how good it was going to be and all the new and innovative features. Not realizing that i should have done my research and ask around a little bit more I pulled the trigger and preordered the game. Days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months when it finally gets released. I excitedly unpacked the game when I realize that its nothing like my friend hyped it up to be as. It was a 70$ mistake but it taught me an important lesson to always be on the look out for bias.

Bias is when are person has a predisposed opinion on a subject for example my dad is in the Navy so if you were to ask whether or not navy

(The college Football team)

would beat Army he would definitely tell you Navy would win. So when asking for advice it is important that you try to get information from people with the least amount bias.

The worst kind of advice you can get and sometimes not the most obviously wrong is that from people that want to purposefully lead you down the wrong path. This kind of advice is the worst due to the fact that a lot of the time it can get you in the worst trouble. It is most commonly seen online in the form of tabloids or fake news articles. It's also one of the most easily taken care of by simply not looking online for advice or making sure you know who exactly your seeking advice from.

In conclusion seeking advice is a great way to widen your point of view but it's important to be knowledgeable of who your asking so you don't end up making a costly mistake.",0
"Dear senator my opinion of the electoral college is that we should change it to a more popular vote. As stated in the article under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors  in this electoral college why do voters vote for electors and not for who they directly want voted in. Also what about the disaster factor and voters actually get confused on who they are actually voting for. At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system,in each state candidiates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the states they know they will have the best chance for more votes. Like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see the candididates at all, including Rhode island and South Carolina. The people need a popular vote because they dont want to vote for people who will vote for them they want to vote directly for the person they want to vote for and as everyone refers the electoral college to as an anachronism, a non democratic way of selecting a president that ought to be overruled  by declaring the candidtae who receives the most popular votes the winner. its official the elctoral college is unfair, outdated,and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without mush basis in reality. Cause some people get so confused or angry on who they are voting for they end up not voting or vote for someone completely random they become faithless as they cannot find a solution.",0
"Anytime someone goes out in public they are more than likely on camera. Technology is becoming more and more advance every day and it has a lot of good benefits. This article talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding system. The use of this technology reading the students expressions in a classroom is valuabe because it can adjust lessons to their need, can tell if something is wrong, and can read almost all emotions they are feeling.

The use of Facial Action Coding is valuable in the classroom because it can adjust lessons to the students needs. In the article the author says  'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'  This show that this technology would help all students learn in a way that benefits them and not be confused in class, but afraid to say anything. Each student learns at their own pace and by sitting infront of these computers they can learn and actually enjoy learning.

Having this type of technoloy in the classroom is really beneficial because it can tell if something is wrong. In the article it states They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. This show that if a student in the classroom is being bullied or going through bad things at home the computer can read that and send some type of alert out to the teacher. This benefits the student because they teacher would be able to sit down with them and help figure out a way to solve his/her problems or how to seek help.

Using the Facial Action Coding technology in the classroom is very valuable because it can read more than one emotion they are feeling. In the article the author states She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This shows that when a student sits infront of the computer it will analyze every part of their face to find how much they are feeling of each emotion. Reading all their emotions is quite beneficial because if they suddenly get very angry or sad they teacher could be notified and they could be pulled out of class to ask what is wrong instead of causing a big scene.

Finally, the Facial Action Coding may have its flaws, but it comes out on top with pretty good benefits especially for students. Putting this in classrooms could save a lot of bad things from happening and help our sociecty grow stronger and more intelligent. Giving this a try could be the beginning to a new and better future for kids all over.",0
"I think studing venus is a good idea becuase there a proboly a lot of new thing to descover on venus. Venus is the cloest planet to earth in the terms of density and size. Even tho each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more then a few hours, and it will still be a good risk for a new life. Not a single spaceship has touchdown on venus in more then three decades. I think studying venus is a good idea because the spaceship that was up there never made it back and one day sombody will. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 precent carbon dioxide blankets venus. the clouds are even more challenging (of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere). Venus has the hottest surface temerature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venus is almost's earth twin but it is just hard to get there and take a long time. There are alot of things that people haven't found yet but are geting closer to finding, it's up to them to bring it back. they are still tring new ways to study venus. for example, (some simplified simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condition). They are trying many different ways to study venus, they are looking back toan old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during the world war 2. I think that they should still study venus becaus it is a lot of thing that haven't found yet.",0
"Education is expensive, but the consequences of a failure to educate, especially in an increasingly globalized world, are even more expensive. Do you agree or disagree?

There are a number of reasons why education is expensive. The first is that it takes time and money to educate someone. Second, it can take a lot of effort and dedication to learn something. Third, it can be difficult to find jobs after leaving school. Fourth, education can help people develop their skills and knowledge. Fifth, it can help people make the most of their lives. Sixth, education can help people develop their civic responsibilities. Seventh, education can help people develop their personal character. Eighth, education can help people learn about the world around them. Ninth, education can help people find a job that they are good at. Tenth, education can help people learn about the different cultures in which they live. Eleventh, and twelfth, education can help people learn about the different ways in which people live.

The cost of education is significant. In the United States, for example, the cost of a high school diploma is $12,000. A college degree, on the other hand, can cost $50,000. This cost is not only expensive, but it can also be difficult to attain. For example, many people have to work hard to get a college degree. Additionally, many jobs do not require a college degree. Therefore, it is important to consider the cost of education before making a decision about whether or not to pursue a particular career.

The cost of education is also important because it can have negative consequences. For example, a person who does not have a college degree may be unable to find a job. This may lead to financial difficulties. Additionally, a person who does not have a college degree may be unable to find a job that is the right fit for them. This may lead to a lack of opportunities. Finally, a person who does not have a college degree may be unable to find a job that pays enough money. This may lead to a lack of financial security.

The cost of education also has a significant impact on the world. For example, a person who does not have a college degree may be unable to find a job in his or her field. This may lead to a lack of opportunities in that field. Additionally, a person who does not have a college degree may be unable to find a job that is the right job for him or her. This may lead to a lack of financial security.

In conclusion, the cost of education is significant. It can be expensive to obtain a college degree, and it can have negative consequences if a person does not have it. Additionally, the cost of education is important because it can help people develop their skills and knowledge, find jobs that they are good at, and learn about the different cultures in which they live.",1
"The author supports this idea by giving information how its different from today then on the 1940s. The author is telling the reader on paragrahp 7 to imagine a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size with the the author wants to say every planet has is own neighbor but they got thier sapce. The author wants to inform the planet Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even thought Mercury is closer to our sun. The author claim is why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface even when Venus still has some features that are analogous to those Earth. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humas to studt Venus.

The author is saying on paragraph 8; 'Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also only because of the human curiosity'. The travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovaton.",0
"Enthusiasm has long been seen as an important factor in achieving success. After all, it's great to have a goal of succeeding, but it takes enthusiasm and passion to actually take the steps necessary to reach that success. When someone is fueled by their passion and inner drive, their enthusiasm usually translates into hard work and dedication. To drive this point home, let us look at some inspiring examples of how enthusiasm has helped people or organizations to achieve great success.

One example can be seen in the rise of tech giants like Apple or Microsoft. Both companies started out with a team of individuals with a common goal: provide innovative and user-friendly technology to people around the world. To do so, they had to work with enthusiasm and dedication to build their products and bring them to the market. Their enthusiasm and hard work paid off, and now Apple and Microsoft are among the most successful and well-known companies in the world. 

Successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists are also an example of how enthusiasm can lead to success. For instance, Bill Gates devoted himself to his charitable work with immense enthusiasm and his organization has contributed immensely to the betterment of society. This shows that success is not always correlated to fame and fortune, but rather to how much effort someone can put in with enthusiasm.

Clearly, the examples provided here are only a few of many. Nevertheless, it is clear that having enthusiasm and passion is a key ingredient for success. It can help drive an individual or an organization to work towards their goal with dedication, until they finally obtain the success that they are aiming for.",1
"Dear Reader's

This statement is wrote by Ralp Waldo Emerson, it's trying to help to the peoples who's thinking about his life, if it's better work indibiduality?

"People that have their faces in front of a screen with there back slouching with the help of technology. Technology is advancing year by year and month by month. When teens or adults get there hands on the new technology they will spend weeks or even months in their rooms, trying to figure out what the device can and cannot do. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives, because it can lead to bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive.

However, not everyone agrees with this statement. Some people claim that technology has a positive effect on peoples lives. Neverless, this position overlooks an important point, mainly that technology cannot change how much human contact you have or do not have. For example, my friend she cannot drive, but she can have items get delivered to her; books, food, and clothes. Furthermore, when the delivery person came she did not know the proper way to greet him. Do to technology, people can have bad communication skills and they don't know how to communicate with people when they are in contact with someone.

Moreover, by being isolated, technology can lead to bad communication skills. When someone gets the newest device or game, they want to know how it works. By learning what the device or video game can and cannot do, they usually spend a month learning how the device works or how to unlock the next level in the game. For instance, my brother got a new video game, he has isolated himself in his room, so he can beat the level and go on to the next. When he was finish with the level, he had a hard time communicating properly. Before he played his video game, his grammar was good; now it wasn't. For example he would use the wrong past and present tense. Thus, by staring at the screen for so long, he has got very inactive.

Additionally, sitting on the couch or in a chair with a screen in front of you, every day for a whole month can make a person inactive. People that are inactive can become very lazy, and they intend on making a lot of mistakes when they are talking. They can also gain weight or have health problems. To illustrate, sitting in front of a screen while eating junk food can cause you to gain weight and can lead to health issues. During spring break, my friend had nothing to do, he was on his laptop everyday eating junk food.

Now he has to be careful on what he can and cannot eat, because he will get heart burn.

If he does not stop eating unhealthy foods in front of a screen he will gain more weight and have more health issues.

He does not know how to ask for help; he needs someone to push him to go outside and enjoy the weather, instead of being in front of a screen all day long.

Based on this argument, one must conclude that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives. Technology can effect us in many different ways; bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive. In conclusion, technology can change human contact in a negative way.",0
"In the modern world, young people are often criticized for not giving enough time to helping their communities. While this may be true in some cases, I believe that many young people are actively engaged in various community service activities. In this essay, I will argue that young people do, in fact, contribute significantly to their communities and that this contribution is essential for the betterment of society.

Firstly, young people are often involved in volunteer work, which is a significant form of community service. Many young people volunteer at local charities, hospitals, and schools, where they provide valuable services to the community. For example, they may help to organize events, provide support to those in need, or assist with fundraising efforts. These activities are essential for building stronger communities and improving the lives of those who live in them.

Secondly, young people are often at the forefront of social and environmental activism. They are passionate about issues such as climate change, social justice, and human rights, and they work tirelessly to raise awareness and effect change. For instance, young people have been instrumental in organizing protests, marches, and rallies to raise awareness about issues such as gun control, police brutality, and racial inequality. They have also been active in promoting sustainability and reducing waste by participating in initiatives such as beach cleanups and tree planting campaigns.

Finally, young people are often involved in mentoring and tutoring programs, which are critical for the development of future generations. Many young people volunteer their time to help children and teenagers with their studies, providing them with the support and guidance they need to succeed. These programs are essential for building stronger communities and ensuring that young people have the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in life.

In conclusion, while it is true that some young people may not give enough time to helping their communities, I believe that the majority of young people are actively engaged in various community service activities. They volunteer their time, participate in social and environmental activism, and mentor and tutor younger generations. These contributions are essential for building stronger communities and improving the lives of those who live in them. Therefore, it is essential to recognize and support the efforts of young people in their communities.",1
"Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be incredibly helpful in living an easier and more fulfilled life. To illustrate this point, I'll share two true stories. 

The first story is from my own experience. When I was struggling with a mental health issue, I decided to reach out to a professional counselor for help. Through talking with the counselor, I was able to identify unhealthy patterns of thinking that were holding me back. With the help of the counselor's guidance, I was able to let go of many of these patterns and move forward with more confidence.

The second story comes from my family. Recently my father encountered a difficult financial situation. He was getting nowhere trying to solve the problem on his own. However, when my father sought advice from a financial expert, he was able to come up with an effective plan to get back on track. My father was eventually able to overcome this obstacle with the help of the financial expert's advice.

These two stories clearly demonstrate the importance of seeking guidance from experts and authorities. To live an easier and more fulfilled life, it's important to be open to seeking help from those who have more knowledge and experience. In many cases, this advice can be the key to unlocking greater success and happiness.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

As our cities become increasingly crowded and our planet faces the threat of climate change, it is becoming clear that we need to find alternatives to our car-dependent lifestyles. Limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation can have several advantages for individuals and society as a whole. This essay will discuss the benefits of limiting car usage based on information from the passages provided.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some areas of the United States. By reducing car usage, we can make a significant impact in reducing our carbon footprint and combating climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The passages mention several instances where cities had to implement driving bans or car-free days due to smog and high levels of pollution. These measures resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and an improvement in air quality. For example, in Paris, congestion decreased by 60% after a partial driving ban was enforced. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can create cleaner and healthier cities.

Limiting car usage also has benefits for individuals. The passages mention that residents of car-free communities reported being happier and less stressed compared to when they owned cars. This is supported by the experience of residents in Vauban, Germany, where 70% of families do not own cars. One resident stated, “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way.” By relying less on cars, individuals can enjoy the benefits of less traffic, more walkable neighborhoods, and a more active and healthy lifestyle.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible neighborhoods. The passages mention the concept of smart planning in which suburbs are designed to be less dependent on cars and more accessible to public transportation. This includes placing stores within walking distance and creating compact communities. This approach not only reduces the need for cars but also promotes a sense of community and interaction among residents.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and society. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, and creates healthier and more connected communities. It also leads to less traffic congestion and can contribute to individuals' happiness and well-being. It is time to rethink our car-dependent lifestyles and embrace alternative modes of transportation for a sustainable and livable future.",1

"Graduating high school in three years instead of four has become a more popular option for many students; however, this can be associated with several drawbacks. For those taking this path, the fast-tracked schedule means having less time for family activities, elective classes that are outside of general academic subjects, and college preparation activities such as SAT and ACT prep as well as college admissions visits. Moreover, the intensified workload can also result in greater stress for those attending school in three years rather than four.

Despite the potential drawbacks, remaining in school for four years can have considerable advantages. Having an extra year of high school allows more time to hone academic interests, thus increasing college readiness. It also allows students to take more elective courses, partake in extracurricular activities, and take part in college preparation activities such as test prep and college visits. Graduating after four years of high school also gives students more time to appreciate their high school experience and make lifelong memories.",1
"In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile, author Nick D'Alto talks about the Facial Action Coding System, a new technology enabling computers to identify human emotions. In paragraph six he briefly talks about how it could work in a classroom setting and I believe that this would be a great new idea to bring into the school systems.

In Making Mona Lisa Smile, Nick D'Alto starts explaining the Facial Action Ciding System by talking about all of it's potential, like how it can recognize even subtle facial movements and how it works will all 44 major muscles in our face. He then talks about all the places where this softwear would be useful like being able to tell if someone , like an important politician, is tellikg the truth or not.

Although he only brings the subject up once, he talks about how in a school setting this softwear would be increadibly uesful to help teach students more by knowing when they are confussed or borded. If teachers had access to infromation like this they would know when a leason is becoming too much for their students and be able to move on or explain it better. I think that this would be one of the most efficient ways to learn properly in school.

Let say a student has been out of it and sudenly realizes he has no idea whats going on during an important leason in his english class, but he doesn't want to say anything to his teacher because he's afraed he'll get in trubble, or maybe he's just to lazy to ask. That student won't have any idea of what to do for the rest of class. If schools had the Facial Action Coding System then the teacher would know right away that the student had not been paying attention and would be able to go back and explain again.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be a great addition to the learning world. Students would never again have to sit through a class and have no idea what was going on because before they got too confused the system would let the teacher know.",0
"Dear Florida Senator,

I believe that we should not have the Electoral College no more. We are giving people false hopes that there vote counts when it really does not. We see on TV ads that we should vote and let our voices be heard but when in reality it is not. Didn't Lincoln once say A nation founded by the people for the people by the people...  he was saying that we should let people have a a voice in everything that happens in America, but we can not even have a voice in who we wanted as president.

We give all the power to the Electoral College but not to the people. In 2000 Al Gore won the popular votes but lost the presidency. What type of system is this where we vote for who we want  but get who we do not want. What the whole reason to vote if the Electoral College vote is more important then our. Beside voting for the president we want we vote for the slate of electors who elect the president. We don't even know who these mysterious Electoral College are they can vote for a president just because he is in the Democratic Party,we have no ideas why.

In 2000 we had the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse when it came to Electoral College. Consider that state legislatures was technically responsible for the picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. The people vote was not heard in that year,because they wanted Al Gore respresenting by the Democratic Party but we got Geroge W. Bush. I have never heard of a more unfair voting system before. Where were our rights the freedom of speech then, it was no where to be found. I feel that voting for who never we want should be in the Bill of Rights. So it okay to a gun for safety in our bag but itnot okay to vote for what we want.

On most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all-system in each state. Some candidates do not spend that much time in states they know they have no chance of winning. In 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not get to see Geroge Bush or Al Gore these states were Rhodes Island with 3 electoral votes and South Carolina with 9 electoral votes. Candidates mostly only visit the states with the most like Florida with 29 and Texas with 38. They do not care about the other states they only care about who have the most electoral votes.

Each party selects slate of electoral they trust to vote for the party nominee and they have rarely been betrayed. It is could be true that the winner of electoral  vote will not win base off of the national popular vote. But it is most likely not to happen again like in 2000 when Al Gore had more popular votes then Bush. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. So no Electoral can have a solid favorite they must vote on who would most likely chance America for the better.

But if the Al Gore vs. Bush happen once what stop it for happening again the reason why it happen was because we had Electoral College so to stop it. We Must stop it.

Florida state Senator as much of a good idea it is to have at some point in time it will go wrong. All good things, have bad endings. So I think it better to stop it now before things for the wrongs like Americans just stop voting becasue we all know our votes do not mean a thing when it come to Electoral College votes.",0
"I think that we should change from the Electoral College, to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Yes, the electoral College in good in some ways, but I believe the flaws it has out numbers the good things. When you vote you really aren't voting for the president but for a slate of electors, there was the 2000 fiasco, and there really isn't that many reasons to keep the current method of choosing our president.

According to the article What is Electoral College? The electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress. So you really are'nt voting for the president but for a slate of electors. electors can be anyone isn't holding a public office. Who is picked as the electors depends on the state. Sometimes there's state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't control who the electors vote for and sometimes voters get confused about electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

There was also the 2000 fiasco that was the biggest election crisis in a century, and the system allows for much worse, according to The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong. There have been a few occasions where faithless electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and casted the deciding vote for whomever they pleased. Oh, and what happens if a state sends two state electors to Congress? According to The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong it happened it hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richar Nixon, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. But who's to say it won't happen again?

The Electoral College does have some goods things about it as well. It states those things in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. 1. There is always a Certainty of Outcome A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. 2. It makes it Everyone's President.The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. Which means no regions has enogh elecotrol votes to elect a president. 3. Swing states, the winnertakeall method of awarding elecotral votes includes the candidates to focus their campaigns efforts on the tossup states. 4. Big States, The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the senate decreed in the Constitution 5. It avoids runoff Elections, Electoral College avoids the problem of electionsin which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Now, you can see why I think we should change from the College Electoral to election by Popular Vote. The Electoral Vote does have it's advantages but I think the many disadvantages that come with it outweigh those advantages.

When you vote you really aren't voting for the president but for a slate of electors, there was the 2000 fiasco, and there really isn't that many reasons to keep the current method of choosing our president.",0
"The idea that colleges and universities should offer more courses on popular music, film, advertising, and television is one that has been gaining traction in recent years. This is because contemporary culture has much greater relevance for students than do arts and literature of the past. While I believe that there is some validity to this argument, I ultimately disagree that colleges and universities should dedicate more of their curriculums to popular culture. 

First and foremost, it is important to note that the knowledge and skills acquired by studying literature and the arts are timeless and have a significant impact on students’ development. Arts and literature provide students with important skills such as critical thinking, analysis, and communication. Studying the arts also allows students to develop an understanding of history, culture, and philosophy that can be applied to contemporary problems. This kind of knowledge is essential in cultivating informed, thoughtful citizens. 

Moreover, while popular culture and technology are constantly changing, they do not always reflect the values and ideals that are important to a college education. Popular culture often reflects a limited range of perspectives and values, which can be limiting and unrepresentative of a diverse and global population. Additionally, much of popular culture is focused on entertainment rather than critical thinking and problem solving, which are integral elements of a college education. 

Finally, dedicating too much of a college curriculum to popular culture can be detrimental to students. It can be difficult for students to keep up with the ever-changing trends in popular culture, and this can lead to a shallow understanding of the topics. Additionally, dedicating too much of a college curriculum to popular culture can be a distraction from the more important topics that are necessary for a college education. 

In conclusion, while there is a case to be made that contemporary culture has much greater relevance for students than do arts and literature of the past, I believe that colleges and universities should not dedicate too much of their curriculums to popular culture. Arts and literature provide students with important skills that are essential for an informed and thoughtful citizenry, and popular culture can often be a distraction from the more important topics necessary for a college education.",1
"During my study I learned a lot about advertisements. One of the most important things I've learned is that most advertisements don't tell you the whole story. They only show you a small part of it. For example, if you see an advertisement for a new car, you might think it's the best car ever made. But when you get behind the wheel, it turns out that the car isn't as good as you thought. The same thing happens with most advertising. It'shows you only a little bit of what's really going on. If you want to learn more about advertising, I suggest you read the book Advertising: The Business of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini.",1
"Have you ever needed some good advice but didnt know who to ask or how many people to talk to about it?

I have an answer, talk to multiple people about it the more the better. Taking someones else's advice opens your eyes to how other people see the situation. also taking multiple peoples advice gives you options its good hearing how others would deal with the situation and different types of people like your family if you get advice from your family or friends they would most likely give you good advice or try to help. if they try to give you bad advice you can tell their fake and want to see you fail.

for example if two friends get in a fight and friend A is popular and has lots of friends but friend B is not so popular and only has a couple of friends. friend B asks one of friend As friends for advice anyways and she says

just stop being friends with her shes mean and doesnt like you anyways. she also asked one of her friends and they said its just a small argument try and apologize they are two different point of views and ones better then the other obviously getting good advice is so important like friend A and friend B if she hadnt gotten two peoples advice then they wouldnt be friends anymore it doesnt matter what the problem is. its important to get more then one persons advice on the situation so it doesnt leave you with no friends in conclusion you should always take someone elses advice and get multiple peoples opinon no mater what, to see who you can actually trust and who to get advice from in the furture",0
"Voting for a president is one of the most important decisions you can make. This person you vote for will be changing the country for better, or for worse. Electoral colleges are a way to see what each of the states want, although some people don't seem to like it. However, I believe it is a good way to see the majorities of the states, which will take account for the majority of the country.

Some people say that electoral colleges aren't a good way to determine which president is good for the country. They say that it's nondemocratic. source 3 However, you are still voting for the person you want. The people are still making a great contribution to the decision. Because in the big picture, your vote really does count. It's a lot better than not being able to contribute at all. Of course things can be better, but the thing is everything can be better in some way. Theres no such thing as something that can't be improved in some way. And there is obviously no way at all that you will be able to please everyone. So I think the electoral college is a good way to average up all the votes.

While there are a lot of variables in this system, it would be difficult to come up with a more solid way. The main complaint is that people think that this system is not a good way to show who the people really want. However, I think this is is not true. You are voting to get the electoral college votes for the president you think will do a better job guiding the country. Your vote truly does count. It adds more chance of the electoral college voting for your side. It shows that all the states are one, and the majority vote shows what side the people of the state want. And that seems like a nice idea to me.

Some of the counter arguments for electoral colleges is that the bigger states get more recognition. And this is true, but isn't that how it should be? Theres more people in the bigger states, so there will be more votes. However, they all count the same, so they don't really get any special advantage. The electoral college is a fair way to really show what the country wants, and some people don't like it, and I think this is a normal occurance.

The electoral college is a good way to show what all of the states want, by putting the majority vote into account to put electoral votes to show what president should be the leader of the country. There are admittedly some problems to it, but I think there would be even more problems with putting it to a popular individual vote. Every system has it's quirks, but overall, the electoral college is a great way to put all of the votes into account, and it's very more organized in the long run. It may not work for everyone, but honestly, nothing can.",0
"When people ask for advice they usually ask for advice in different areas like say you need help with a babys name you wouldnt know, thats why you need different opinions from your family, friends co-workers, people that care about you , people that would give you a great opinion or in this case , a great name to name your newborn baby.

Once you have a problem in mind that you caant seem to figure out and have trouble with, you tend to get a little hasty and you have to go around your friend group etc and get different opinions from everyone.

Different opinions are a great way to make the right decision, if you get bad opinions you can get the wrong idea and make a bad decision thats why you need to be careful who you ask and how you ask for an opinion.

More than one opinion, and both times they are the same opinion you are more likely to be right or make the right decision the first time than get a bad opinion and be wrong all the time.

In conclusion different opinions are a great way to make somehting happen, or make a right decision and have a great outcome, and having a bad opinion can lead you to a bad oucome and worse answers to your problem.",0
"The text

The Challenge of Exploring Venus, treats a very important decision, that is the worthines of pursuing or not the study of the planet Venus despite the danger it presents, the author agrees to this idea of pursuing said study, but he support's his idea of studying Venus in a very poorly way.

The autor of

The Challenge of Exploring Venus made the text so that people would know the rewards of exploring Venus, but during the text he does nothing but make the idea less apealing to the eyes of the people, this is shown by the following excerpt A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience in our own planet.... Venusion geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.this excerpt is one of the reasons this text apeals more to an idea of disagreement than one of agreement, making the reader feel more inclined to disagree with the authors oppinion, being this the opposite of the whole reason of the text.

This also can be shown by the next quote  However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the panet can provide only limited inshight on ground conditions... More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.

this quote not only does not help the authors point of view but it also contradicts this passage, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientis to float above the fray. this causes a clash of ideas, wich is not a good think to try and convince people.

In conclusion the Text of The Challenge of Exploring Venus creates a feeling of disagreement/fear towards the idea of studying the planet venus, this is conflicting with the idea of worhtines of pursuit of venus that the author tries to give the text, meaning that the text does not support the author's idea and if it does it, is in a very poorly way.",0
"What is the best way to learn? Students learn best when they are actively engaged in the learning process. Students should be encouraged to ask questions, make observations, and participate in class discussions. They should also be given the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them.

"Dear Senator of Florida, What is the point of people voting if they are not really getting a say in who they are really voting for? The Electoral College has a bigger say then the thousands of of people who vote. How can a group of peoples say mean more then thousands of people in the United States. Also, the WinnerTakeAll system does not help anymore then the Electoral college does. What is so special about the Electoral College that they get picked specially to make their vote count on who wins or loses the election?

Their has been many mishappens because of the Electoral College. For example, from an excerpt called The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong says The single argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worst. This shows that the electoral college does do damage to the United States because they let a huge crisis happen during the elections. They could have let it get even worst because they allow it to and make it easy to make things worst in certain crisis.

I feel like you should give the people more of a say because half of the people that vote probably don't even know that they are not actually voting for the president. They probably vote thinking that they are voting for the president not for the electoral college to see who will end up on the board. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters. Voters pay to vote, to what pay the Electoral College to vote and make their say so important it is sad. The reason it is sad is because all kids want to do when their younger is vote because they feel like it symbolizes them growing up and like they get a real say in who the next president is or the senate anything just as longs as they get a say. But truthful their not getting a say in who will be the next senate, treasurer, or president their actually picking the board who will be picking for them.

Even the People once wanted to abolish the Electoral College. These People were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO. Turned out their not the only ones according to the exerpt from The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong. is sates They're not alone according to a gallop poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al Gore thanks the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. It also states that This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. This show how the elections are in a way screwed up because they already in a way know how many votes a certain person is going to get and how many votes the other person is going to get. They practicly alredy know who is going to win the election before the voting even begins because the board already has it all planned out.

So really thier is no need for the Electoral College because all they do is make the competion unfair for the other person going for the election. Also, because they have cause or been a part of problems and mishappens. In an article it mentions Perhaps moat worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, were staes delegation vote on president. Also, when you are voting for the VicePresident you are not actually voting the senat picks who the VicePresident is. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters and the people running in the election.",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of whether to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from multiple sources, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained. Although there are valid counterarguments for changing to a popular vote, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures that every region is represented, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, gives weight to larger states, and prevents run-off elections.

One of the key reasons to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. While disputes over the Electoral College vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes in most states, where even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory, reduces the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to campaign across the country and appeal to diverse regions. This prevents candidates with only regional appeal from being elected and ensures that every region feels represented.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. In a close election, candidates concentrate their attention on the states that are most likely to determine the outcome. This leads to increased voter attention and engagement in those states, as voters feel that their votes will have a significant impact on the election. The thoughtful and informed voters in swing states should be the ones to decide the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance to the political weight of large states. Due to the malapportionment of the Senate, large states have less influence in the political process. The Electoral College provides a platform for presidential candidates to pay attention to larger states, as winning a large state garners more electoral votes compared to winning a small state. This ensures that the concerns and interests of residents in large states are not disregarded.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. With the Electoral College, a candidate who wins a majority in the Electoral College becomes the clear winner, regardless of their plurality in the popular vote. This eliminates the possibility of prolonged election procedures and complications that would arise from run-off elections.

While it can be argued that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the overall impact is minimal. The turnout in presidential elections is already high, with about half of the eligible American population voting. Voters participate to express their political preferences rather than in hopes of swinging a national election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained as it provides certainty of outcome, guarantees representation for every region, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, gives weight to larger states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote, the benefits of the Electoral College outweigh those arguments. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.

"Why should we study the Venus as a worthy pursuit? going to Venus we will discover a lot of new things that we didn't know about. When going to Venus you can give away the curiosity's that people may have on the planet. But going to Venus could be a risk factor or it can be something that we discover and put it on earth.

In the passage the author states that traviling to Veuins is going to be a challenge but is still wanting to make a pursuit to go. In paragraph five the author states that

''(NASA) has one particularly compeling idea for sending humans to study Venus''. The author states NASA to show that a very big company wants to know what is up in Venus, so it should be studieded. In paragraph eight the author states that ''Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has valued, not only because of the insights to be gained on the planet itself''. This shows that the author says taking a challnge is a good thing when you want to find something out, so take challenges. In paragrqph four the author says ''If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even disscusing further visits to its surface''. The author uses this to ask a question to have you thinking to show that even scientist are curious about the planet Venus and the readers should be to. In paragraph one the author explains what other people think about they say that Venus is a evening star so the author is saying that there are miths about Venus, so the author trys to explain that traviling to Venus will take away the curiositys so, it might be a new way to discover new things to bring back to earth to share with the world; because it can advance things. The author uses alot of questions to show what he is refering to with traviling to Venus and making the reader aprove with his oppinion. In paragraph seven he states that ''some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simbulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. This shows that NASA was conducting experiments where a computer can take such bad climate.

The author uses alot of questions to show that what they are talking about is true and they even had evidence to support there idea. They even used other researchers oppinons like NASA and other scientist to show that they are also on the authors side so should Venus be traviled?.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This trend is gaining popularity across the globe, as evidenced by the car-free communities in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and create more livable and vibrant communities.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some parts of the United States, that number can go as high as 50 percent. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint. This is particularly important in the fight against climate change and the pursuit of sustainable living.

Another benefit is the reduction of traffic congestion. Cars are the linchpin of suburban life, but their dominance on the roads leads to clogged highways and busy streets. By promoting car-free communities like Vauban in Germany, we can create more accessible and walkable neighborhoods. Placing stores along main streets instead of distant highways encourages people to walk or bike, reducing traffic congestion and improving overall mobility.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more livable and vibrant communities. The car-dominated suburbs that were popular in the 1950s may no longer be sustainable in the face of increasing car ownership and urbanization. By prioritizing public transportation, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, we can create communities that are more connected and cohesive. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but also attracts visitors and boosts local economies.

Moreover, the trend of limiting car usage can also have positive implications for public health. By encouraging active transportation like walking and biking, we can promote physical activity and reduce the sedentary lifestyle that often comes with car-centric living. This can help combat issues such as obesity and improve overall public health outcomes.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, creating livable communities, and promoting public health, we can move towards a more sustainable and resilient future. The examples of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to embrace this trend and work towards a future with a reduced reliance on cars.",1
"Dear Mr. Senator, Over the course of American history the US has always had an Electoral College, which was designed for untrustworthy ballot counting during the 18th century. Today the world is in the past century and therefore the Electoral College is outdated on a several century basis. The Electoral College should be abolished because it is outdated and creates politicians that only care about the larger states. Even though America is a Republic the vast majority of people believe it is a Democracy, and that they elect the elected politicians as a people, but in truth elect people to elect politicians for them.

To commence, the Electoral College has no need for presense because it is simply outdated. The Electoral College was made for people to elect people to elect a president, which in its entirety is completly unfair, also it was made when a smaller population was present and the ballot counters where unreliable without the use of electronic counters. Now, one can argue that age has nothing to do with the election process because the close ties rarely happen the most recent one in 2000 and before that 1888 but a close tie is not the reason. Today the world lives in a modern era where we know how many people voted for a specific candidate but still we use the electoral college to see who wins what state. For example, Al Gore, the presidential candidate in 2000, won the popular vote but lost the presidency9, now how is that fair? It is fair because of the Electoral College, where the popular vote isn't always the winner. Clearly, the Electoral College is outdated and should be abolished.

Furthermore, the Electoral College creates politicians that care not about the country but the large states, which have the most votes. A presidential candidate may forget about small states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina and focus on larger ones, like California or Texas, that foster larger amounts of votes. For example, during the 2000 election seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina13, but all the big states did. This is because politicians want to win and not focus on what needs to be done and only say what people want to hear. But once again there is always an argument people can argue that the Electoral College wins by region, which explains why some states don't see the candidates, or that big sates allows for political balance. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does21.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be abolished because it is outdated and creates politicians that only care about the larger states. The US has outdated politics that have no need in todays society, why should the people depend on this outdated system? Also, the politicians only want to win the large states because of this system that does not always coincide with the popular vote. Overall, the Electoral College needs to be abolished.",0
"Working in a group comes with clear advantages over working alone. While it can be tempting to go it alone on a project, expertise and efficiency are much better achieved when working with a team. For example, collaborating with others makes it easier to divide the work and to complete tasks faster. Additionally, the benefits of having access to different perspectives can significantly improve the accuracy of a project. Having a variety of opinions also helps ensure effective problem-solving. 

However, there are some potential drawbacks to working in a group. Teammates may not always agree on how to proceed or handle tough decisions. Moreover, conflicts may arise and disagreements may delay progress. Finally, interpersonal dynamics that are out of sync can lead to tension in the office. 

In conclusion, although there are some negatives to working in a group, the advantages generally outweigh the drawbacks. When people work together, it can be an incredibly powerful source of creativity, talent, and collaboration that can drive a project towards successful completion.",1
"Most people would like to think the Face on Mars is related to aliens in some way. However, that theory is highly unlikely. As in the in the article, the pictures from three different time periods, show different things, and each is more accurate than the other. It appears in the third picture (the most updated picture from 2001) that there is no face at all. It simply looks like a natural landform. The face was just shadows.

Even with the most updated and accurate picture from 2001, people still like to argue it could be a connection to alien life. Alien life has yet to be proven and is based off of theories, just like the face on Mars. These people are just ignoring the facts. My question is, why are people still basing there theory on an outdated and poor-pixlated picture when the newest one prooves its just a landform? I would like to think it has to do with fantasy. Most people get so stuck on something they wish were true just to make there life more entertaining, and most people like a little mystery as well. The thing is though that facts over-rule theories and perdictions.

According to the article, it says that with the newest picture, if there were something, we would've caught it in the picture. That is proof that it is only a landform. They even compare it to some of our landforms on earth, so I don't see how people still believe it could be something else. As I've adressed before, alien life isn't even prooven, so how could we be sure if this is connected to that all? We can't.

I would also like to adress shadows. In the first picture it had been said that they were only just shadows. There have been many instances of when we've seen shadows on objects and thought it looked like something else. This case isn't any different than that. We base most things on what we see rather than what it really is. It tells us in the article people have put the face in things such as movies, books, and magazines. For some reason people tend to feed into those things rather than whats really true. That goes along with the thing I said earlier about how people will believe what they want and pick the thing thats more exiting over whats logical.

There are facts and there are theories. Facts are what tell us that the 'Face on Mars isn't anything alien related just a natural landform. Kind of a dissapointment really.",0
"Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to you as a constituent and active participant in our democracy to share my perspective on a matter of national concern: the continuance or dissolution of the Electoral College. The founders of our nation crafted the Electoral College as a compromise to ensure both direct individual contribution and representation at a state level (Paragraph 1, Text 1). Nonetheless, its relevance and efficacy have become subjects of intense debate, and I believe it is crucial that we preserve this system.

One predominant argument against the Electoral College is that it is not in line with the tenets of a direct democracy (Paragraph 14, Text 2). While this critique holds some truth, the function of the Electoral College extends beyond simple vote counting. It stratifies attention based on state engagements, forcing presidential candidates to appeal across regional lines (Paragraph 19, Text 3). A candidate with a broad trans-regional appeal is more likely to effectively serve the entire country as their policies must be inclusive of various regions, making the election process more democratic in a comprehensive sense.

The current system has been criticized for allowing a presidential candidate to lose the popular vote but win the presidency via electoral votes, as occurred in the 2000 election (Paragraph 9, Text 2). This scenario, though striking, is rare, and the Electoral College, in contrast, often lends clarity to electoral outcomes (Paragraph 18, Text 3). The winner-takes-all method, usually resulting in landslide victories within states and a more definitive outcome, reduces the likelihood of contested results.

Critics also argue that the Electoral College encourages candidates to strategically target swing states, leaving certain areas inadequately represented (Paragraph 13, Text 2). However, all voters are equal stakeholders in our democracy, and their votes matter in shaping the final tally. Moreover, focusing on swing states encourages political engagement and thoughtful voting (Paragraph 20, Text 3).

Additionally, the Electoral College rectifies the political imbalance that large states suffer due to the Senate's mal-apportionment, ensuring they receive due attention from presidential candidates (Paragraph 21, Text 3). Finally, the Electoral College simplifies the electoral process, all but eliminating the need for run-off elections in instances where no candidate achieves the voting majority, providing a clear winner in each election cycle (Paragraph 22, Text 3).

While it is extremely important to voice criticisms of our electoral processes, it is equally crucial to understand the practical usefulness of the existing structures. Therefore, in light of the rationales listed above, I express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue. I am confident that you will consider all perspectives in this discussion when forming your stance.

"When you think about limiting car usage you might think Well how am I supposed to get there. Theres no way i'm able to get to my destination without a car. Yes, I'm pretty sure we all would'nt want to walk five thousand miles to visit a friend three hours away, but here me out. Doesnt a car make you all tired? Knowing you have to pay a bill every month, or getting gas four times a week. Just imagine a world where thats not a problem.

In Vauban Germany they are most of the time a car free zone. Owners of cars aren't allowed to have cars in there garage or in the streets or wherever a car would normally be. They have to keep there cars in a space they buy at the edge of the community for 40,000 plus the paying for their homes. Now I wouldnt want to pay all this money to park my car. Most people in suburban homes sold their vehicles so that they could live there without a problem. Heidren Walter said, When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. She says as she's walking down the street she can actual listen to the community of children playing and not be drown out from the loud motor in the car.

Now, limiting car usage doesnt mean we all have to walk to our destinations. We could start using bicycles more often and actually get a benefit of working out. Sure it might make you all sweaty and gross. But make a plan to get up a little earlier and then wash up at wherever it is you are to be. And limiting cars doesnt mean every single one of us need to give up our cars. Instead we can find a friend who lives near to us or a fellow coworker and car pool. Instead of all two hundred employes lugging their cars on the road and getting stuck in torturous traffic. make a plan to get five people in a car and instead of two hundred cars on their way to work, there would only be about fourty cars going to the same place. That would clear up our roads and reduce traffic. In France Congestion was down sixty percent after reducing cars.

Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Westurn Europe.. ,according to Robert Duffer. People today are now worrying to much on their cars and how much it will cost them. Not worrying about jobs and insurance. The invention of the car was not to see who can get the most miles or whos car gets better horse power. It was about helping people get from A to B, and we can do just that.

There are many people out here who will think that limiting car use is a waste of time and like to keep things the same. But we can be the generation who changes that. If we could go down to one car a family and start car pooling with one another, or even start using bikes to go to places with our friends, we can help make the community a better place. One day just try. Try walking to the super market. Instead of making your mom drive you and your friends to the mall, try making a plan to all ride your bikes there. It doesnt hurt to try, so try to start.",0
"The e-dictionary has become more and more popular among the students and there is no denying that it is really quite convenient to the students when they have some difficulties in learning.

However, there are some disadvantages of using the electronic dictionary. One of the disadvantages is the fact that students are not able to check the spelling of a word by themselves. They have to rely on the help of someone else to do it for them. Another disadvantage is that if a student has a spelling mistake in his/her essay, he/she has to go through the whole essay again to correct the mistake. This can be quite frustrating for the student who is trying to learn the English language. In addition to these disadvantages, students may also find it difficult to find the correct spellings of words in the dictionary, especially if they do not have access to a computer. Therefore, it would be better for students to use a dictionary that is available in their own country.",1
"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system in presidential elections. While there are valid arguments to change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that should be considered. I have thoroughly analyzed the information from various sources and would like to present my case based on the texts provided.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome, which is less likely to be disputed compared to a popular vote system. As highlighted in In Defense of the Electoral College by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all approach in most states creates a landslide victory, minimizing the possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This stability in outcome ensures that the election process does not suffer from prolonged uncertainty and potential disputes.

Another critical benefit of the Electoral College system is that it promotes the representation of all regions and discourages candidates from focusing solely on heavily populated areas. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, regional favorites without nationwide appeal are unlikely to be successful presidents. Under the Electoral College, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal to secure the necessary electoral votes for victory. This ensures that the president represents various regions of the country and takes into account the interests of all citizens, regardless of their geographical location.

The third advantage of the Electoral College system lies in its promotion of swing states. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's text, the winner-take-all approach incentivizes candidates to focus on competitive states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention, leading to better-informed and thoughtful decision-making. By concentrating campaign efforts in these states, candidates are more likely to engage with citizens, discuss important issues, and address the concerns of the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance regarding the influence of large states versus small states. Large states, as Bradford Plumer highlights in The Indefensible Electoral College, receive more attention from presidential candidates due to their greater number of electoral votes. This helps prevent the political disadvantages that large states face as a consequence of the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate. By providing a larger political weight to large states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates must campaign across both large and small states, guaranteeing a more inclusive approach to the electorate.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid the need for run-off elections. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, reducing the pressure for additional elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the complications and challenges associated with run-off elections and maintains the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College system can discourage some potential voters in states where their preferred candidate does not have a chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of eligible American citizens still exercise their right to vote in presidential elections. As voters, we express our political preferences and values, regardless of the potential impact of our individual votes on the national outcome. The Electoral College does not prevent citizens from engaging in the electoral process but ensures that all states and regions have a meaningful role in electing the president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, as established by our founding fathers, offers crucial benefits that should be taken into consideration. It promotes stability in election outcomes, encourages the representation of all regions, focuses campaigns on competitive swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. I respectfully request that you consider these points in your decision-making as you deliberate on the future of our electoral system.

Thank you for your time and attention. I trust that you will carefully consider the perspectives presented in this letter along with the information provided in the supporting texts. I look forward to witnessing your thoughtful determination on this matter that affects our democratic process.

Sincerely,

"There are many great ways to travel, but group travel is definitely the best way to do it. A group of people can be more organized and efficient than one person, and they can share the same interests and goals. This type of travel can be very rewarding, as it can give you a unique perspective on the world and allow you to meet new people from all over the world.

There are a few things that you should consider before booking a group tour. First, make sure that the group you choose has the right size. A group that is too small will not be able to enjoy the experience as much as a group that is correct in size. Additionally, make sure that the group has the right level of experience. A group that is too experienced will not be able to enjoy the trip as much as a group that is at the right level.

Finally, make sure that the group has the right equipment. This includes the right clothes, food, and transportation. If the group does not have the right equipment, the trip will not be as enjoyable.",1
"Living an active lifestyle is incredibly important for both individuals and societies alike. Physically active individuals have stronger physical and mental health, increased longevity, and exhibit personality traits linked to higher levels of well-being. For societies, physical activity reduces healthcare costs associated with chronic diseases, and increases productivity. 

For individuals, an active lifestyle can help to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, improve mental health, reduce anxiety and depression, and improve overall quality of life. Studies have shown that physical activity can also help to boost mood, increase self-esteem, and increase energy level. Regular aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular health and lowers blood pressure, and resistance training helps to build strength and muscular endurance. 

At the societal level, physical activity reduces healthcare costs associated with chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Exercise also boosts productivity, as it helps to reduce the number of days missed from work due to illness or injury, as well as reduces the cost of employee healthcare. Active individuals also contribute to a healthier and more productive environment, as they are more likely to engage in activities such as volunteering, and have involvement in their community. 

It is clear that living an active lifestyle is important for both individuals and society, and that the benefits of engaging in regular physical activity are vast. We should all strive to add more activity into our daily lives in order to reap the countless physical, mental, and social benefits.",1
"As technology becomes increasingly entrenched in our lives, the need for accessible and cost effective computer software has never been greater. While there are countless programs available to purchase or download for free, very few of them can match the effectiveness of open source software. Open source software is a type of computer application that is made freely available by its developers under an agreement that allows users to modify and redistribute it without any restrictions or fees. In other words, open source applications are not only affordable but also highly customizable making them ideal for any individual or business looking to get the most out of their computing experience. One example of popular open source software is Linux OS which offers a reliable alternative to Microsoft Windows operating systems thanks largely due to its advanced security features as well as its robust performance across different hardware configurations. Despite much skepticism from some quarters about the reliability and stability of Linux-based systems, recent versions have generally received positive reviews from industry experts who testify about its overall value in comparison with more expensive proprietary solutions. Open source applications aren't just limited to operating systems either; great examples exist within all areas including web browsers such as Firefox, music players such as VLC Player, document editors like LibreOffice Writer and even creative tools like GIMP image editor – all developed on an ‘open’ basis so everyone can access them at no cost whatsoever! In short then open source provides numerous benefits over their closed counterparts in terms both financial savings and user flexibility – allowing users full control over how they use their devices while saving money too!. Overall then it's clear why this type of computer application has become ever more popular in recent years - providing cheaper options compared with commercial packages while still offering great levels customization potential through direct user involvement with code development (something impossible with traditional license based models). As technology continues advancing so too will demand for innovative yet economical solutions – meaning we can expect this trend toward openness and affordability will continue into future generations where anyone seeking better computing experiences",1
"In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because venus could possibly be a planet that once had life on it. Venus may have once been the most Earth like planet in our solar system.

The author states in Paragraph 4,

Long Ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, like Earth. The author put this in the passage to explain why we should keep trying to explore Venus despite the dangers it presents. If we were to continue exploring Venus and there was life on the planet then we could possibly find out what killed the living things and how long they survived on venus and if something similar could happen to Earth.

The author also states in Paragraph 8, Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The author put this in the passage to explain that if there was once life on Venus and whatever killed them could happen to us, so we need to explore Venus so we know what things to watch for so we don't end up like the forms of life possibly did on Venus.

The author sugests the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because we could possibly explore Venus but may not be to that level because there are still many things that need to be figured out before anyone can land on Venus and survive longer than a couple hours.",0
"Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day.

Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them .

Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they don't go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day.

Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they don't have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day.

In my opinion I feel like we shouldn't add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we won't be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom can't .

I wouldn't like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep.",0
"There is no denying that our world is becoming increasingly filled with plastic bags and other forms of rubbish. While some people argue that this is simply a result of our throw-away society, I believe that there are other factors at play.

For one, the vast majority of plastic bags are not actually recycled. In fact, less than 1% of all plastic bags are recycled globally. This means that the vast majority of plastic bags end up in landfill, where they can take up to 1,000 years to decompose.

Furthermore, many plastic bags are not even made from recycled materials. In fact, most are made from virgin plastic, which is derived from fossil fuels. This means that not only are we filling up our landfills with plastic bags, but we are also contributing to the depletion of our natural resources.

So, while it is true that our throw-away society is partly to blame for the increasing amount of plastic bags in our environment, I believe that there are other factors at play. If we are to reduce the amount of plastic bags in our environment, we need to focus on recycling and reducing our reliance on virgin materials.",1
I think this pogram should be in every school beacuse this could help the younger students to learn more about the school. And the older students can the younger students and they can show them which room they have to go. And its better this way beacuse the older students knows more things about the school then the younger students do. And this could help the younger students learn more about the school. This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students. Now the srudents feel more comfortable beacuse they got helped from the other students from the other students so now the younger students feel way happier beacuse they know where to go. And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and fustrated beacuse they will be all lost beacuse they new to the school and wont have no one to help them. The younger students going to be really sad beacuse they wouldnt know what to do and what class they have to go. So this a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students. And the younger students gonna learn from the older students and this pogram can help the younger students get their grades up beacuse older students can help them do they work and get their grades up,0
"Cell Phone Drivers

Today, the majority of humans in the world own and use cell phones everyday, however no person should be allowed to use their cellular device while operating a vehicle. These vehicles include trucks, sedans, vans, heavy machinery vehicles, bikes, etc. The use of a cellular device while operating a vehicle serves as a major distraction to the driver; even if the driver only looked at the phone just a second could call for a fatal result. Thousands of people die every year due to cell phone use while operating a vehicle, however fatalities, as such, could easily be avoided if drivers would wait until they're no longer driving to check their phones. Texting and driving can be as dangerous as driving intoxicated, driving under the influence, for you reaction time is weakened due to the distraction of your phone. A good reason to not text while driving would be that it takes only a few seconds to park your car, if looking at your phone is that important. With how today's cellphones are made to draw the user in, it is imperative that drivers make the smart decision to just wait to use their phones.

When texting while driving, you are more likely to end up in a wreck rather than going about your day. According to https://www. netsafeutah. org/teens/staysafe/distracted_driving. html , Drivers on the phone have worse reaction times than many drunk drivers. this is important because when you look at your phone while driving is like the equivalent to driving with a blind fold on, and the time it takes the driver to look back at the road from looking at their phone is the same amount of time that it would take to take the blindfold off. According to https://www. nhtsa. gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving,

Texting is the most alarming distraction. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed. It only take five seconds of a distraction mistake to result in something that can catastrophically change your life forever, and not in a good way! In all consideration, as a driver, if there is a high need to be on the phone just pull the car over. Although it only takes five seconds of distraction to end in a crash, it takes just a few seconds to pull over safely.

Why risk the consequences of using a phone while driving to begin with? Although the results of using a phone while driving may very, the odds still are not in your favor! As the driver you not only risk your own life, but you also put other lives in your vicinity at risk. According to Jim Forsyth, a Reuters reporter, The typical reaction time without texting was between one and two seconds, but while texting it increased to three to four seconds, regardless of whether the driver was typing or reading a text. (https://www. abc. net. au/science/articles/2011/10/06/3333955. htm). When it comes to driving reacting and timing is everything, but when a driver gets distracted it is almost inevitable for something bad to happen. When driving there is already so much happening on the road, so much that there's not much room for error, that those two seconds of reaction time are key to preventing a car crash. There are so many rules and laws to driving a motor vehicle, however the easiest, of all the rules and laws, is to not text while driving. In fact if a driver always follow this rule, they could be considered a superhero for all the lives they save by not putting others at risk because they did not text and drive.

Is texting and driving at the same time dangerous? One must not have a brain to think there are no risks to texting and driving. Sure, everyone has done it, so why not? Everytime a person texts and drives, they put themselves and others on the road in danger of ending in a car accident or worse death. Don't text and drive, because doing this you will save lives!",0
"In the recent years the state of the country has been a major issue. The environment is a growing concern and the economic condition of the citizens is a pressing matter. One way the alleviate the stress on these factors is to limit car use. Doing so will help the environment by limiting greenhouse incisions, and not having a car all together or limiting car use will save money for those who are economicly weak. Limited car use would alleviate all these problems.

The environment houses us along with everything that supplies us with the means to live. In recent years that has been under attack by pollution. according to Robert Duffer one of the major issues of Paris, France is the increasing smog and pollution that has decended upon the city. The level of pollution rivaled the most polluted cities in the world: Beijing China. In order to combat the smog French officials have placed a ban on drving, and for those that chose to disobey recived a fine. The smog then cleared up to allow the ruling French party to rescind the ban. This should be an example for highly poluted areas everywhere. Not only does this preserves the environment but it also takes the health and well being of citizens into account.

The limited use of cars would help those who are finacialy weak to strengthen themselves, because not having to use money to pay for the expenses of a car would leave you money to take care of other necessities. Elisabeth Rosenthal wrote that in some German suburbs there is 70% of the people residing there that do not have cars. And there is only a few places where they can be parked, and for the places that allow parked must be purchased for 40,000 dollars, along with a house. Just not having a car itself would be much more affordable! 57% of the people who live in that suburban area sold their cars to move there. As shown by Rosenthal's report, not having a car would prove to be more economicaly sound and benifital especially to those who are struggling.

There are many advantages to the limiting of the usage of cars. For one thing it aids the environment by adding less pollutants into the air, which harm the environment and the people in it. Also people that use their cars less save money, which would benifit those whoa rent in the best possible economic situation. Many say that limiting the use of acars would prevent many from going to work, school and other obligagtions, but there are other means of transportaion including bikes, buses, subways and monorails. Think of the disadvantages to excessive car use, high pollution, expensive expenses such as gasoline and maintence of the car. Limited car use would remove all these burdens.",0
"Cars are like beneficial disadvantages they allow you to arrive at your destination in a short amount of time, but they add to the world's pollution growing issue. Individuals in every single part of the world own cars and millions of cars are on our streets and highways daily. Whether it is to comute to work or visit a friend in the next town over, individuals are constantly on the road. While cars do simplify our lives today, in the near future cars will become a burden, due to the amount of pollution they produce and the stress they cause upon individuals. Limiting car usage in all parts of the world will bring more joy and persistent smiles.

Cars play a dramatic role in the amount of pollution that is in our air today. Which is also essential for our survival. Limiting car usage will decrease the amount of pollution we have today and the disgusting greenhouse gas emissions. Up to 50 percent of green house gas emissions alone are caused by carintense areas in the United States acknowledged by Elisabeth Rosenthal, in the article  In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars . Furthermore, in the capital of France due to intensifying smog 60 percent of the individuals were in a severe traffic jam explained by Robert Duffer, in  . The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days and the warmer layer of air imprisoning car emissions and pollution pollution being caused by over usage of cars, meaning car usage should be limited if not halted all at once.

Individuals participating in events like Carfree day and living in towns like Vauban tend to be a lot more joyful and enthusiastic. When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way said by an individual named Heidrun Walter, who moved to Vauban for a more jubilating experience. Cars add stress due to having to be stuck in agonising traffic and having to pay for ridiculous gas prices. Also, by limiting car usage you'll witness and hear more individuals enjoying themselves walking the street, and the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowning out the occasional distant motor. described by Robert Duffer, in  In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars . Evenmore so, by abandoning your vehicle at home you won't have to deal with enebidable traffic and It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution brought up by Andrew Selsky, in source 3  Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota . Carless stress less.

Before saying cars are benefitial think of all the disadvanteges that they hold. All the disadvanteges out weigh the advantages. Pollution no matter how big or small is a humungous issue that can be prevented little by little by limiting car usage. Also, limited smiles will become persistent smiles if you limit car usage across the nation. More smiles and less cars is the way to go.",0
"Nowadays, more and more college students rent apartments and live outside campus. I agree with this statement for the following reasons.

First, living in an apartment gives students more freedom than living in a dormitory. They can come and go as they please and don’t have to follow the rules and regulations that are typically associated with on-campus housing.

Second, apartments are usually more comfortable and spacious than dorm rooms. This is especially important for students who have to share a room with another person.

Third, living in an apartment can be more economical than living in a dormitory. This is because apartments typically have kitchen facilities where students can prepare their own meals, which can save them a lot of money on food costs.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to living in an apartment as a college student. These advantages include more freedom, more comfort, and more economical living expenses.",1
"It is no secret that technology has been a major factor in the advancement of our world and all its inhabitants. However, one particular area of technology that often goes overlooked is robotics. Robotics has become an invaluable tool, providing us with ways to automate tedious tasks and increasing efficiency while helping to improve safety standards in many industries where manual labor had previously been required. Robotics can be found in almost every industry nowadays but it's most commonly used within manufacturing processes due to their ability to perform precise movements faster than humans are able too. Automated robots are increasingly being used on assembly lines around the globe as they can operate for longer periods without breaks and their accuracy levels not only ensure fewer errors but also better quality products being produced at a much lower cost compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, these robotic machines don’t require expensive training or maintenance costs associated with human staff which further reduces overall production costs for businesses who implement them into their daily operations. In addition, robotic arms have greatly enhanced workplace safety by reducing the need for dangerous manual labor such as lifting heavy objects or working with hazardous materials like acids which could potentially cause harm if handled incorrectly by humans; essentially removing any risk altogether from those types of activities. This level of precision allows factories and manufacturers to create environments that are safer both physically and chemically meaning employees no longer need put themselves in danger when performing certain duties - allowing them instead to focus on more important tasks whilst knowing they are safe from harm thanks to robotics taking care of the mundane jobs. Overall, it’s clear that robotics offers countless benefits within various industries making them an essential part of our everyday lives – revolutionizing how we get things done! From reducing expenses associated with labor costs through automating tedious processes ensuring greater levels of efficiency & accuracy – it’s really no surprise why so many businesses rely heavily upon integrated robotic systems today!",1
"It is a great choice to have multiple people opinions when asking for advice. Having multiple opinions on something that you're not sure about is good because there could be a good and bad side to the situation that someone is holding back from you. For example; I vented to my friend, Generic_Name,and asked her for advice on my love life or just my problems in general, and all she really said was

aww its gonna be okay, don't stress about it, you'll find someone better.

, but when i vented to my friend, Generic_Name, she told me a lot of the stuff i'm going/been through,she has also. So she had plenty to say and she was very supportive and caring and i knew i could reflect off what she responded when i vented to her because she has been in the situation before. Now I always vent to her because I know she'll listen and help me; i can always trust her not to say anything to anyone about what I vent to her about.

From that example you can tell that they both had different points of view. One of them was completely all ears and could relate to me and the other one was just semi-supportive. It's always great to have different points of view because, you'll have those friends that asks are you okay when you're feeling down just so that they can know you're business; they don't really want to help you.

Then on the other hand you'll have those friends that checks up on you everyday , and make sure that you're okay and if you aren't, they try their best to cheer you up, help you with the situation and are there for you no matter what. Those are the friends that you can trust.

When you want to decide on doing something like, let's say jumping off a bridge. You really want to do it because it seem fun but at the same time you could get seriously injured. So you ask one friend would it be an good idea and that friend tells you

yea man, do it, it'll be fun!

Then you ask another friend and that friend tells you that you shouldn't do it because multiple people have died from jumping off an bridge. After hearing that, you decide that you don't want to jump off the bridge because that's basically committing suicide. If you didn't have that other person opinion you probably would've jumped off the bridge and that would've been the end for you.

Now having multiple people opinions could sometimes be bad. So you're procrastinating about if you should do your homework or not. You want to get the grade but you don't feel like doing the homework. You ask multiple people in your class if they did the homework and they all say no. Then you're like okay at least i won't be the only one that didn't do it and maybe since no one did it then the teacher will push the date back or just forget about it. Then you get to school the next day and your teacher says that the homework counted as a quiz grade. Now you're sad and wishing that you did the homework.

As you can see having a second or third opinion when asking for advice is good. It will never be bad if you use your common sense while taking in the advice. Having that second voice can prevent you from doing something that you'll regret for the rest of your life. It can also help you to be a better person and grow with yourself. Sometimes a second voice is all you need to be successful. Whether that second voice is a voice in your head, a friend, or even a family member. Sometimes talking to family about your situations is hard because they wouldn't understand it like someone your age will. Just make sure that second voice is someone you can trust, someone that wants you to do good, someone that wants to see the good in you, and someone that wants to help you be successful.",0
"I agree that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual as well as psychological development. There are many reasons why I believe this to be the case.

First, computer games often require players to sit for hours at a time in front of a screen, which can have negative effects on the body. For example, prolonged sitting can lead to obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. In addition, computer games can also cause problems with the eyesight of players. For example, they can cause problems with the development of binocular vision, which is important for reading and other activities.

Second, computer games can have a negative impact on the mental health of children. For example, they can lead to problems with attention and concentration, as well as problems with the ability to think critically. They can also lead to problems with the development of problem-solving skills, which is important for the future.

Third, computer games can have a negative impact on the development of the brain. For example, they can lead to problems with the development of spatial skills, which is important for the development of navigation skills and the ability to think abstractly. They can also lead to problems with the development of cognitive skills, which is important for the future.

Finally, computer games can have a negative impact on the development of social skills. For example, they can lead to problems with the development of communication skills.",1
"On May 24, 2001, about 25 years ago the NASA's viking spacecraft was circling the planet. It then spotted a human like face. It was huge! It was nearly two miles long. It looked like it had been staring back at the camera from where this picture had been taken.

The face is clearly a natural landform. When Mars Global flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin snapped a picture ten times sharper than the first photo. When this picture was taken it was a very cloudy day. This means that the camera had to peer through all the clouds to get this good of a picture. But skeptics say that the aliens images were hidden by the haze. That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform.

This is a great natural landform and it is very questionable at first, if this could really just be a natural landform. But knowing that the NASA has went out more than one time and taken pictures of this face really does show that it is not aliens. Not only have we taken pictures but we have proof. These are all the reasons why it is certain that this face is a natural landform.",0
"Drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving a vehicle. If text and drive you're more likely to crash. Texting & driving Is more weakening to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol. There's a lot of hands free technology. You have to think about other people and not just yourself you could hit a person or a car. Those are reasons you should not text and drive.

If you text and drive you're 23 more times likely to crash. In 2011 1.3 million car accidents were caused by texting and driving. In 2015 3,477 people were killed, and 391,000 were injured in accidents caused by drivers distracted by their phones. Looking at your phone while driving and being distracted is equivalent to drinking four beers. When there is dangerous situation and you're looking at your phone you aren't going to notice. Texting and driving does nothing but put you and other people in danger.

When you text and drive you're not just putting yourself in danger, but also anyone else in the car or any innocent pedestrians. Regardless of how quickly you feel you can glance at your phone or respond to a text, taking your eyes off the road not only risks the lives of everyone around you, it risks your own life. Texting and driving with children in the car is most importantly a horrible idea as it risks their young innocent lives. It's much easier to just pull over or at least wait till you get to a red-light. If the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!

There's so much new hands free technology, so you shouldn't even want to risk your life. If your phone has Bluetooth enabled on it, it will easily connect to any hands-free device. This means that you have the ability, at the very least, to talk on your mobile phone while driving. Hands-free technology means staying connected while driving and staying alive. Hands- free technology mounted in the car isn't much different from being on your phone, but it's there so take advantage.

Using your phone while driving is dangerous and you just shouldn't do it. To be honest your life isn't even worth it. Even if you think you're the best driver ever, an accident that could've been prevented won't be because you aren't focused on the road. It's also a good idea to set the default do not disturb setting on your phone while driving. Some new phones have a app that senses when you're driving.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in various case studies and trends around the world that demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car dependency.

One notable example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. The community is designed to be car-free, with limited parking spaces at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars in order to move there. This drastic reduction in car ownership has led to happier residents, like media trainer and mother Heidrun Walter, who says she is much happier this way without a car. This example shows that limiting car usage can improve quality of life for individuals.

Furthermore, reducing car usage is crucial in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.

Studies in the United States suggest that Americans are already driving less and buying fewer cars, indicating a potential shift in behavior and a decrease in car dependency. This trend is beneficial for the environment, as transportation is a major source of emissions. It also has implications for the car industry, with companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranding themselves as mobility companies to adapt to changing consumer preferences.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on urban planning and public transportation. Planners are now taking the concept of car reduction to the suburbs, making them more compact and accessible to public transportation. This approach prioritizes walkability and reduces the need for vast parking lots and highways. By creating communities with easy access to stores and public transportation, we can promote a more sustainable and efficient use of space.

International examples also demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat high levels of pollution, leading to a 60 percent decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia, implemented a car-free day, showcasing the success of alternative transportation options such as buses, taxis, and bicycles. These initiatives not only reduce emissions and improve air quality but also promote healthier and more active lifestyles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages, ranging from improved quality of life for individuals to mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable urban planning. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car dependency through measures such as creating car-free communities, implementing driving bans, and promoting alternative transportation options. By embracing policies and behaviors that limit car usage, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Being in a car is how we transport ourselves to and from places. Now what would you do if you had to give up your car. Yes, some people didnt mind giving up their cars but not everyone would be ok with this. We have gotten so used to driving cars that i don't know what some people would do if they had to give up their means of transportation. Its also another factored that what if someone had to drive a long ways, it would take them even longer to get where they're going. Its a very serious topic when you think of how much time one person spends in a car.

Well Paris has enforced a driving ban to help clear the air of pollution. On mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Many people, in Paris, were fined for driving on the wrong day. Paris wanted to do something about the smog that was surrounding their beautiful city, so they figured if there wasnt as many cars polluting the air then the smog would go away. It actually helped having cars stop driving on certain days because the smog actually cleared.

Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. American has always had a thing for cars but lately that seems to be a false statement. In the more populated citys, people are using more bikes and less cars. Its easier to get around a city where there are thousands of people on the streets alone. Internet maybe a huge reason why theres less dringing because it feels like your more connected with your friends and family without actually having to go anywhere. The need for cars in the U.S. has gone down dramadically.

Ever been to a place where there are no cars aloud. Well in Vauban, Germany there is a place where if you want to go there you have to give up your car. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden is this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg. People are happier without the stress of a car says Heidrun Walter. This is a place for clean air and no pollution from the car fumes. As of right now, this experiment seems to be running quite nicely.

In all actuality, how many people dont realize how long they spend of their life in a car? If one day all cars in the world were banned, how would everyone recate? Some people may want to give up their cars, some people may not want to give up their cars. There are many sides to people giving up their cars. Some people are truly happy and some are not. It may not be that bad, i mean how did people manige before cars were even invented. In one acrtical, it say there is a place where no cars are aloud but it also says that that place is an experimental project. In the end cars are just no as popular as they used to be. is that a good or bad thing, you decide.",0
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus, written by Dr. James Smith, suggests studying Venus is important despite the many risks involved. Dr. Smith provides compelling evidence to support his argument that Venus is worth exploring. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

Dr. Smith's article is well researched, and he presents numerous reasons why exploring Mars is essential to our knowledge of the universe. First, he explains that Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, with temperatures that reach up to 864 Fahrenheit. This extreme heat makes it challenging to explore the planet without the proper equipment. However, Dr. Smith points out that scientists have already created heat-resistant rovers that can withstand these temperatures.

Second, Dr. Smith mentions that Venus has an extremely thick atmosphere, which makes it difficult to explore. This thick atmosphere also makes it hard for spacecraft to land safely on the planet's surface. However, Dr. Smith argues that scientists have already developed technology that can penetrate through the thick atmosphere and safely land on the planet.

Third, Dr. Smith highlights the importance of studying Venus to understand more about the greenhouse effect, which causes the planet's extreme temperatures. By studying Venus, scientists can gain a better understanding of how the greenhouse effect works on other planets, including Earth.

Overall, Dr. Smith presents compelling evidence to support his argument that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the many dangers involved. Although exploring Venus poses numerous challenges, scientists have already developed technology that can overcome many of these obstacles. Additionally, studying Venus could help scientists understand more about the greenhouse effect and how it affects planets across the universe.

In conclusion, Dr. Smith's article provides convincing evidence that studying Venus is an important pursuit despite the risks it presents. While exploring Venus presents many challenges, scientists have already developed technology that makes it possible to explore the planet safely. Moreover, studying Venus could help scientists learn more about the greenhouse effect and how it affects planets across the universe. Therefore, I agree with Dr. Smith's argument that exploring Venus is a worthy endeavor.",1
"The impact of technology on modern art is both palpable and profound. The introduction of digital tools has changed the way artists create and present their artwork, giving them more freedom to explore new styles and mediums than ever before. From photography to 3D printing, the range of creative possibilities afforded by technology has opened up a whole world of artistic expression for today's artists. It allows them to capture scenes with precision that was impossible just a few decades ago, as well as create works that could never have been produced in traditional ways. Furthermore, it provides an outlet for collaboration among creatives from all over the world who may not even know each other personally but can still share ideas via online platforms like Instagram or Twitter. Nevertheless, despite its many advantages, there are also drawbacks associated with this technological revolution in art creation; one major concern being quality control. With so many tools at their disposal now allowing almost anyone to become an artist overnight, it can be difficult to discern good work from bad or simply mediocre efforts since everyone's interpretation of what constitutes 'quality' is different. In addition to this potential lack of curation when it comes to showcasing artwork digitally, there's also the issue of copyright infringement which affects professional photographers especially hard due largely its ease-of-accessibility through image sharing sites such as Google Images or Pinterest. Overall though, while these issues should certainly be taken into consideration when considering the implications for modern art created using technology; they shouldn't distract from the overall positive effects experienced by those within the creative community thanks primarily innovation made possible through advances in software engineering and hardware design over recent years. From budding amateurs trying out something new for fun on weekends all the way up top professionals utilizing cutting-edge tech for commercial projects; every level of artist standshas benefited greatlyfrom this exciting evolution in technique - making it easier than ever beforeto bring our imaginative visions into reality!",1
"Dear. principal

I'll say the policy #1 because student its a good rule that student can only use there cell phone during the lunch and other free time so that the student can do something that make them fun during lunch time. its also good because student uses there phone to call there parent to pick them up or they forgot something on there house he or she can just call there parent to bring it to school.

"Driving while using your cell phone has become a very controversial issue currently. Millions of drivers have had mixed feelings and opinions on this subject. In result, people have taken opposing sides. Some believe driving with using your phone isn't such a dangerous task, while others strongly believe it is an action that should never be done by drivers. They argue that this is very unsafe and can distract the driver from paying attention to the road. I agree. I believe that drivers should not use their cellphones while driving.

To begin, driving while using your phone is a very unsafe action. This is because this dangerous action diverts the driver's attention. Drivers are more prone to look at the phone to text or call someone.

When this occurs, drivers are less likely to pay attention to the road, the drivers around them, and their surroundings. Consequently, car accidents are more likely to happen.

On the other hand, some believe driving while using your cellphone isn't a distraction. However, this opinion is false. According to edgarsnyder. com, a credible personal injury law firm, it stated, Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. This statistic shows the absolute dangers driving while texting can cause. All in all, driving and using your phone is very dangerous and unsafe to the driver, passengers, and all people on the road.

In conclusion, driving while using or operating your cellphone is a dangerous act. Drivers should be paying attention to the road, not their phones. Cellphones offer huge distractions due to the easy accessibility to text messaging, video messaging, and all social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat, YouTube, and Facebook. It is a huge distraction and severe consequences will almost always occur.",0
