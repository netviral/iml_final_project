"Cars. [TAKEN] Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.

In like matter of this, article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.

Likewise, in the article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.

In conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.",0
"Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.

A small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a ""carfree"" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.

Another insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.

Could you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.

To conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.",0
"""America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling"" says Elisabeth rosenthal. To understand rosenthal's perspective, it is easier to suggest that America's car usage is decreasing slowly. This isn't necessarily bad in the sense that it has certain positive effects. The advantages of limiting car usage includes an increase in security and health, along with a decrease in pollution and dependence.

Firstly, when car usage is limited security and health is more likely to be guaranteed. The feeling of being secure is highly important to individuals everywhere. For example, many people in colombia used public transportation during a car free day ""leaving the streets of this capital city "", according to Andrew Selsky, ""eerily devoid of traffic jams"". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Heidrun Walter states ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. when an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Selsky ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"". Less cars means healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.

Secondly, limting car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Now a days people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yespollution is bad for the environment. Yes a bad envorment means unhealthy living. Yes cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completley dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.

Additionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possesion. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says ""all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly devloped. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal ""cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed were't going to work anyway"". Many people can't have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. Peope have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage , these effcts could be controlled.

To conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. limiting car usage is a positive way to enfore an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be reffered to as a succesful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.",0
"How often do you ride in a car? Do you drive a one or any other motor vehicle to work? The store? To the mall? Have you ever thought about how many people in the world do that exact same thing travel to every destination using a fuel powered motorvehicle. Not many people realize the intensive damage that they're doing when they turn their key in the ignition. What if you didn't drive to work today? If you're like any regular car user, the thought ""What?! I could never survive without my car!"" may run through your mind. It is possible though, to live without your main mean of transport. Just look at cities like cuban, Paris, and Bogota each one has in some way restricted their people's usage of cars and they actually enjoy it! If you limit your car usage, it can intern result in many advantages and benefits in yourself and in your community.

A not so recognized benefit to giving up your car usage would be the positive consequences it has on your health. In source 1, Heidrun Walter states that ""When he had a car, he was always tense. He's much happier without it."" Think about it, imagine all the angry road rage you experience while driving. That surely does not have a positive effect on your mood or health. Driving takes a copious amount of focus and mental activity, such as, trying to navigate, dealing with bad drivers, etc., that after a short period of time, you're stressed out and tired. In cities like New York and Paris, the population is high. This leads to congestion in the streets and excessive amounts of pollution. Warm layers of air, according to Robert Duffer in ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" traps the car emissions. How is that healthy? He also states that Paris had to enforce a temporary driving ban after the pollution levels reached an all time record. After a few days of less driving the pollution went way down. Since people aren't driving, they have to find other means of transport. This could include walking, biking, or skating to destinations. Those are all physical excercises! Your body is getting to work out and you'll mentally feel fresher more than you would sitting in a car.

Taking a break from driving also can help with the overall look of your city. Pollution doesn't cause the flowers to grow. It certainly doesn't smell nice. It sets a filter over the town and gives off a ""dirty"" vibe. With less driving, there is less nasty pollution being emitted, therefore leading to a cleaner community. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, ""In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars,"" she gives the good point that since there is a restriction on car and motor vehicle transportation, there is going to be more walkers. If you have tons of people taking the sidewalks instead of the roads, you might need a few more pathways and closer stores that are in walking distance. Andrew Selsky states that ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" As stated previously, pollution is not benefiting the environment. Organizations such as the Envronmental Protection Agency in the U.S., are promoting ""car reduced"" communities, says Rosenthal. These communities have far less pollution and are much cleaner. Cities are also promoting this idea and are having days devoted to ""nocar driving."" In Bogota, Colombia, they hold an anual ""carfree"" day where only buses and taxis are permitted. Any other drivers would be fined. Although fining someone for using a posession they own might ruffle some feathers, it did have a successful turn out and significantly reduced the ""smog."" In conclusion, although the idea of giving up our precious automobiles for walking to our destination might sound impossible, it's not. Reducing our driving can lead to many benefits and advantages in our daily lives. These include an increase in health, an improved look to our cities, and an improved environment all around us.",0
"Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point i. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possiile. Cars are a suitaile to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a puilic ius, iut those other forms of transportation just might ie the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an aisolutly amazing thing iut, mayie they just cause way to much stress, and mayie they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a ius or a train you do not have to worry aiout washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a iad traffic jam on I4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, iut there are many advantages to limiting our car usage.

One advantage that not only humans would ienefit from, iut also plants and animals is that there would ie a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extremely harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhaust pipes in our cars. Your car alone docent give off much gas iut collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in iig cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record ireaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ian on cars. This is descriied in the second article "" Paris ians driving due to smog"", iy Roiert Duffer, "" On Monday motorists with evennumiered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumiered plates the following day."" After France limited driving there congestion was down iy 60 percent. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columiia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article ""carfree day is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota"", iy Andrew Selsky, it descriies the annual carfree day they have to reduce smog. "" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". So all over the world people are relizing that without cars, we are insuring the safety and well ieing of our environment.

The second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. having to repeating wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the iack of your car screaming and yelling all while music is ilasting, causes stress. So oiviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not ie as stressed as we usually are. There would ie no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article "" In German Suiuri, life goes on without cars"", iy Elisaieth Rosenthal, a citizen named humdrum Walter, states "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". So with out the stress of a car humdrum Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, "" Carfree dai is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota"", iy Andrew Selsky, it states "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use, one ieing theat we get to help the environment and two ieing that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to iecome the healthy environment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to ie unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get ietter and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it. Some might not think that this is an advantage, iut i just explained that it is a clear advantege that has ieen proved to help the enviornment and reduce stress. Limiting car use is a very effective advantage that really does work in more than one place.",0
"The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candied. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. In source two it states that electors can choose there opposing candidate. Which declines the the whole voting process. Why do we vote? we vote to select a leader who will defend this country and make america a place of opportunity. The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the "" winners it take all"" rule.

We as american people cannot choose their own government, as it says in source two, that when voters vote they are voting for the candidates electors. Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amount of electoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college, then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair because if the majority of a state for example chose republican candidate, then that would be vague because some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral college, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.

In source two it says that electoral who have been select by the state can choose their opposing candidtade, which is more disatvantgeing to the american people and america's future. for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were ""faithless"" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.

In source two and three it states the rule "" winner take it all"". The votes the other lose the, winning can take it all, that vote that they take from the losing does not count Because the people really didnt mean to vote for the candidate they don't want or the candidate they dont support, its like your money fell on the floor and someone just took it knowing its yours.

In conclusion, the state senators should eliminate the electoral college because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.",0
"Dear state senator, It is the utmost respect that I ask for the method for presidential election be changed from the electoral college to something more suitable for the opinion of the people. The electoral college is an unfair system to the people, it can allow for individuals to decide what to do with the votes, not by the people of the United States of America.

Revising the electoral college system may seem like a bad idea but the good that could come of it overlies the bad. If the election of a president was based directly by the voters , then candidates could promise money to the people who vote for himher. There could also be other problems with direct democracy such as what would happen in the chance of a tie? Who would break the tie? And how would it be decided fairly. The electoral college shouldn't be removed, but should definitely be revised.

The electoral college permits the power of the electoral votes to go to whoever the choose. The electoral college is unfair to voters due to the winnertakeall system, whichh causes candidates to focus only on states the are ""swing"" states. In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all. The electoral college is an outofdate system and either needs to be replaced or revised.

When running for president, the candidate has a group of electors. With each candidate having their own group of electors, it provides without having to visit each state to nget their vote. The only thing the president is required to do is to wait. In reality, the president doesn't even need to campaign, since the electors in the college votes are what matter. So, the candidate could just bribe the electors for certain states and heshe has that states' vote.

The voters do not vote for the candidates, but vote for the slate of electors. The electors are picked at state conventions, the state party's central committee and sometime the presidential candidates themselves. The biggest issue with the electoral college is the disaster factor. The disaster factor are the potential problems with the system, such as back in 1960 when segregationists in louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy.

The electoral college is an outdated way of elections. The electoral college puts the power into indivduals' hands not the people. It was created back before the education was nothing close to what it is now. Therefore, the method of voting on representitives who then vote for the presdient is obsolete.",0
"Fellow citizens, cars have become a major role in our daily lives. They have their many excellent uses, however there are advantages of limiting that usage. To name a few are, that it's environmentally healthier and it's less money you have to spend on them. Now let me explain why it's a smart choice to take advantage of limited usage of cars.

Paris recently according to source two article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer came up with a brilliant idea of partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. They took days were only even or odd license plated cars would drive or they would suffer a fine. However public transit was free throughout the week. This promoted less congestion and smog which is much better for the environment by lowering the amount of pollution in the ozone layer. As well as a cheaper way to commute. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". This shows just how out of hand the smog had gotten but with limiting the amount of cars used they managed to clear over half of it! Making the world greener than before.

Meanwhile in places such as Vauban, Germany, the residents went as far as giving up there cars. according to source one article ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"" By Elisabeth Rosenthal About 70% of the residents no longer own cars because it's either too expensive to have one on the edge of town and it's generally forbidden in this experiment in the new district. They even go as far as to say that it's better without having one. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter,a resident in Vauban according to the article. People in general, especially the younger generations don't use cars or have liscenes in comparison to older people who are more likely to retain their licenses as the age was shown in research. People now don't care as much as what cars are driven but are more focused to get from point A to point B, it's simply a means of transportation. In source 4 article ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

When it comes down to it, cars are transportation, but there are plenty of other means of transport that are free or cheaper such as buses, trains, bikes or even car pooling. While at the same time creating less pollution and congestion, making it environmentally healthier.",0
"""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer, Source 2. Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a disaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding runoff elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it. The people who despise the electoral college are in favor of popular vote since it is the better choice.

For various reasons the electoral college is unfair such as not everyones decisions count just those few people in the electoral college. In a popular vote election everyones vote counts not just those who are considered better than us because they hold authority over people. Those people can also be sneaky and can change votes to be in favor of their choice of president. They will even take bribes sometimes just because they can even though us other people do count.

The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. ""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsi the electoral college!"" Plumer, Source 2 and many others do agree with this statement because it rather true that we do so instead of let a bunch of monkeys run our states and country, but I am pretty sure that sometimes they could even do a better job than those in office right now. "".....over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" Plumer, Source 2 every day as we continue that percentage continues to grow and that data was recorded in 2000.

Lastly, the electoral college is irrational like seriously what idiotic person came up with this. I will say this again, but a monkey could of made a better system than this. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president........Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, soemtimes the presidential candidate themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. DO voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate? Sometimes"" Plumer, Source 2 I know this statement says it all because how could one simply not want popular vote after reading this.

I know that electoral college vote can help and not cause problems, but there are more problems while there is one easy fix which is popular vote. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer, Source 2.",0
"The Electoral College has been kept for centuries, established by the founding fathers and established in the Constitution. I think that the process should be maintained so far, it has worked fine and I do not see any reason to rid of it. The Electoral College should be continued in use because there are at least five main scenarios in which it is helpful and reasonable.

In ways, the Electoral College could be dangerous to use unless you have electors that are completely faithful in their party, and do not take advantage of getting to choose where to place their vote. Basically, voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then elect the president. These electors can go against the people's majority votes and decide who to vote for. It could also be possible that a state sends two slates of electors to elect. If the election was a direct vote, there would be almost no chance for a tie to happen, but with the Electoral College, there is always that possibility. Some states do not even see the candidates because of the majority of the people living there belong to a single party, and the ""winnertakesall"" system completely affects this. If the election were to be a direct vote, the candidates might visit the states in order to gather as many votes as possible. However, many of these reasons that the Electoral college should be abolished are just one time things, so consider the other side of the argument.

Swing states basically decide the election and therefore, they are the most thoughtful voters. They know that they will be the ones to decide the election, so they pay more attention to the news, and the candidates campaigns. The swing states receive the most information and attention from the candidates. Since they will end up deciding, the candidates want them on their side. Many states are already predicted, even before the election, as a majority of them are from one party. These voters think the most about who they want to run our country and who will do the best in that position, so they should be granted the honor of making the decision.

Electoral votes help avoid runoff elections, by reducing the pressure that might complicate the election. Say that our government referred to the direct vote system, with a lesser system known as the Electoral College was for comparison, and during the presidential election, there happened to be a problem with the popular votes versus the Electoral College this complication could be avoided if we used the Electoral College. This has happened with nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, when they both had only a 43 plurality of the popular votes but were winning in the Electoral College.

The Electoral College could be unwanted by many minority voters in states that leaned completely one way. These voters hardly pay attention during the campaign because they know that their vote will hardly make a diffference in their state, but a voter's vote could not swing a complete election, and not the full population voted in the 2012 election. Voters usually just like to express their preference and have it known than decide the vote that will make an election. It is more likely that your vote will count if you are educated in the happenings of the government, and maybe your vote can make a difference.",0
"Dear senator, Retain the Electoral College. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electors is is required to elect the President. Each state has hisher own electors which are chosen by the candidate political party. You should keep the Electoral College because you have certainty of outcome, and the President is everyones not just yours.

The first reason why you should stay with the Electoral College is because you are certain that the outcome will be in favor of one of the candidates. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote may happen but it is very unlikely that it will even though that 538number of electors in the Electoral College is a even numberS.3.For example in 2012's election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the popular cast for him and rodney because all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that stateS.3. However,because of the winnertakeall system in each state,candidates dont spend time in staes they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the close,tight races in the ""swing""statesS.2. But, the winning candidates share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The second reason you should keep the Electoral College is because the president is everyone's. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president by themselves. So for example,a solid regional favorite,such as rodney was in the South,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states he knows for sure that he will winS.3.A president with only his regional apppeal is very unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions may feel like there votes dont count or that he really isnt there president.

In conclusion, you should stay with the Electoral College simply because you most likely not going to have a tie and because the president is everyone's.",0
"""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Heidrun Walter source 1. For many years, people have depended on cars to take them places and allow them to live a normal life. However, the recent decline in driving and car sales has proven that there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage would help reduce the greenhouse effect, would help reduce smog and other lowair pollution, as well as helping promote aspects of the eeconomy which differ from purely car sales and transportation.

To begin with, the greenhouse effect, a large part of which is caused by cars and their emissions, is endangering not only our environments and ecosystems, but also life as we know it. According to source 1 In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, passengers car are the cause of 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and also responsible for approximately 50% of emissions in certain parts of the US. Setting restrictions would allow for a decline in emission of greenhouse gases, which in turn would better life on Earth. Its effects could be seen all over the world, such as in global warming, rising oceans, etc. Therefore, limiting car usage would have a positive effect, because it would reduce the emission greenhouse gases.

Equally important, the presence of smog, pollutioncaused fog, and lowair pollution is also endangering the wellbeing of humans and other species health, as well as the wellbeing of the Earth, so to speak. According to source 2 Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, ""After Days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" after setting restrictions for five days, Paris saw an improvement in air quality. We can thus infer that setting restrictions regularly would help reduce the pollution and general smog of the area. Placing restrictions would help promote various means of transportation, such as public transportation, bikes, walking, etc. An example would be the one from source 3 Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota in this case, a day during which a capital city places restrictions of the use of cars, helps build a campaign, which allows for bike paths, parks, and sport centers to be created and for sidewalks to be repaired. It has also led to restrictions to regulate rushhour traffic. Clearly, reducing and limiting car usage can not only reduce smog and lowair pollution, but can also help create a more active city.

Finally, limiting car usage may promote different aspects of the eeconomy. According to source 1, the transportation bills in the US budget have, in the past, been used, for the most part, for highways. Reducing car usage may allow for certain parts of the US budget to be used for more important and diverse things, such as education, government funding, community life, and many more. Also, limitations on car usage could help conserve resources, allowing people to place their money into different aspects of their lives, like it is explained in source 4. Moreover, the less people can use their cars, the less people will buy cars source 4: ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license"". This will help people focus on rebuilding the economy. Obviously, there are economic advantages to limiting car usage, such as availability for flexibility in the government budget, conserving money, and the rebuilding of the eeconomy.

To conclude, there are various advantages to limiting car usage limitations may help improve the eeconomy, will help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, and will help reduce the lowair pollution and smog often found in largely populated areas.",0
"Voting for a president is one of the most important decisions you can make. This person you vote for will be changing the country for better, or for worse. Electoral colleges are a way to see what each of the states want, although some people don't seem to like it. However, I believe it is a good way to see the majorities of the states, which will take account for the majority of the country.

Some people say that electoral colleges aren't a good way to determine which president is good for the country. They say that it's nondemocratic. source 3 However, you are still voting for the person you want. The people are still making a great contribution to the decision. Because in the big picture, your vote really does count. It's a lot better than not being able to contribute at all. Of course things can be better, but the thing is everything can be better in some way. Theres no such thing as something that can't be improved in some way. And there is obviously no way at all that you will be able to please everyone. So I think the electoral college is a good way to average up all the votes.

While there are a lot of variables in this system, it would be difficult to come up with a more solid way. The main complaint is that people think that this system is not a good way to show who the people really want. However, I think this is is not true. You are voting to get the electoral college votes for the president you think will do a better job guiding the country. Your vote truly does count. It adds more chance of the electoral college voting for your side. It shows that all the states are one, and the majority vote shows what side the people of the state want. And that seems like a nice idea to me.

Some of the counter arguments for electoral colleges is that the bigger states get more recognition. And this is true, but isn't that how it should be? Theres more people in the bigger states, so there will be more votes. However, they all count the same, so they don't really get any special advantage. The electoral college is a fair way to really show what the country wants, and some people don't like it, and I think this is a normal occurance.

The electoral college is a good way to show what all of the states want, by putting the majority vote into account to put electoral votes to show what president should be the leader of the country. There are admittedly some problems to it, but I think there would be even more problems with putting it to a popular individual vote. Every system has it's quirks, but overall, the electoral college is a great way to put all of the votes into account, and it's very more organized in the long run. It may not work for everyone, but honestly, nothing can.",0
"dear senator, I have come to a conclusion on how I think the president and his candidates should be voted for. In one hand we've got the Electoral College, and the election by popular vote. These two thing have been around for hundreds of years but you've got to know if you prefer one or the other. So which one works better? Why do you prefer this one over the other?

The Electoral College, electors meeting and voting for our president and vice president. This electoral college consist of 538 electors that vote to for our president. I myself dont think this is a very sensible thing. Because when you think you're voting for the president you are actually voting for a state of electors who will in turn vote for the president not you. Why should there be a select few people out of the billions of people who live in america to vote for the president while we just sit and wait for the results. To only have their opinions voiced. Does'nt seem like a very fair way to elect someone who will be changing our country. This is a winnertakeallsystem.

Election by popular vote, this means you and I will be voting for the president and his cabinet ourselves. That we will have a say in who we want to change or even fix our country. Although the person we vote for may not win, we still got a say in what we believe would have made our country a better place. Although the Electoral College might give a more clear winner, if we know that our vote will actually have an effect in the election we might pay more attention to the election and vote more wisely. Knowing that we have voiced our preference rather than knowing maybe one single electoral vote might have set the election.

Now there are some benefits if the Electoral College. In the case of having a precise vote on who gets to be president is one. Also maybe the fact that you voted fo the people who will be electing the president in a way is just the same. However this does notmean that it is better than you just voting yourself. Because those are onlyabout the two thing that are evn remotely good about the Electoral College.

So when you decide who you want to be president think of how you would like your vote to be heard. through your own vote or maybepossibly through anothers vote. I know which system i would choose. Giving that it would give me more voicein the matter.",0
"Everyone wants to go to the park with their children or grandchildren, or maybe just take a nice walk. With the way we live now everything will be too polluted because alot of people drive cars and dont take the bus,walk, or carpool. Yes, people should limit their car usage. They should limit their uses because owning a car is expensive, it promotes the use of walking and public transportation, and it reduces smogpollution.

Owning a car is more expensive then you think. In a city such as Vauban in Germany that has only two places to park, a large parking garage, and a develment where the car owner needs to buy the spot for forty thousand dollars along with a home. In places like Bogota, Columbia on their national car free day all violaters will be fined twentyfive dollars. It may not seem like alot, but it all adds up at the end of the day. In places like Paris motorist with even numbered license plates receive a twentytwo euro fine 31, and the following day motorist with odd numbered plates received the same fine. Almost four thousand drivers were fined. those are just instances where fines have occurred, other expenses are gas. Some people who are wealthy and have money won't be impacted by this the same way an average family with three children will.

Most people take public transportation for granted. Imagine if we didn't have busses, trains, and subways. Imagine having to drive to New York City instead of the subway. It is not a pretty thought. In places like Bogota, Columbia that has a national day without cars people use public transportation or walk, unless they want a twentyfive dollar fine. According to Mayor Antanas Mockus "" The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" Cities such as Cali and Valledupar have also done what Bogota has done, and Municipal authorities from other countries came to see the turnout, and they were enthusiastic. New York is promoting a bike sharing program that allows people to ride bikes through the city and return them at any location. ""me. Sivaks's son lives in San Francisco and has a car, but takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit when he can even though it often takes longer then driving."" Even though some people don't take public transportation beacuse they are too cool for it, they might just need to in order to save the place they live.

Have you ever wondered why you can hardly see the stars at night? It's not because they aren't there, but it is beacuse the smoke from the pollution and smog is covering the view. After days of nearrecord pollution Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of all the polution. Congestion of the smog only went down sixty percent in five days. The reason was of diesel fuel which is more used because france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Places like Bogota, Columbia who have a day without cars have a day for pollution and smog to be reduced, and places like Vauban, Germany who only have cars on the main thoroughfare virtually have no smog or pollution beacuse they don't allow cars in homes. Even though it's a hassle to change everything to do it, but by just doing one thing a time they are helping the enviroment.

Now that we see and know that the people of Vauban, Germany live with no cars, and the people of Bogota, Columbia have a day with no cars. those places don't have as much pollution such as Paris who had to ban driving so they can reduce pollution. We know that in Vauban you can park the car for forty thousand dolalrs, or get fined for driving on the one day you are asked not to. All thoose reasons only promotes public transportation or walking. So yes, people should limit there use of cars because it is expensive, it promotes the use of walking and public transportation, and it reduces smogpollution.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage in our community. Other countries such as France, Germany, and Colombia are home to cities that are working towards cutting down the use of personal automobiles. Many of the people in these places find that using alternative transportation means proves to be less stressful. Studies even show that fewer Americans are purchasing cars for themselves. Now is the perfect time to join in with Vauban, Bogota, and New York and spend less time in our cars.

It may seem hard to believe, but in Germany, there's a suburban area where residents live without their own cars. According to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the streets of Vauban, Germany remain ""carfree"" aside from some public transport. The article states that ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."". Heidrun Walter was quoted in the excerpt saying ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way..."" Communities in Europe and the United States are hoping to move towards this ""carfree"" lifestyle, in order to become less dependent on automobile usage and cut back on greenhouse gas emissions that damage the environment. We may see an increase in the number of ""smart planning"" areas across the globe. If a mass of citizens wish to lessen the amount of time they spend in their cars, it's possible, and the city can adapt to a more automobileless way of life.

Bogota, Columbia dedicates a day to transportation without the use of personal cars, where the city's goal is ""...to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". Many who visit Bogota during this time are impressed by the ""revolutionary change"" they see unfold before their eyes. Going ""carfree"" leads to more physical activity amongst residents and an overall nicerlooking community. ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky claims ""Parks and sports centers... have bloomed throughout the city... sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."". Not only does the city reduce the amount of greenhouse gas it contributes to the atmosphere, but it results in a more active and betterlooking community.

What change would we see in our own community were we to follow in the footsteps of Bogota and Vauban? The United States is seeing a decrease of car ownership in the country. Less and less people are buying automoblies and obtaining driver's licenses. ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal says that ""...America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling."" The writer cites investment research company Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, which states ""...the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter..."" The country is already subconsciously moving towards a more carindependent lifestyle. The millenial generation seems to be the biggest contributor to this declined interest in carownership. With improved methods of communication by means of social media and cellphones, as well as more use of carpooling and public transportation, people are staving away from car commuting. While this may require a change within the automobile industry, many agree that this turning away from private car usage will see communities striving to be more time and energy efficient when it comes to transportation.

Limiting the use of cars can lead to a less polluted and stressful environment, more exerciseoriented and upscale communities, and the conservation of our natural resources. Cities around the world are working to become less cardependent, so that they may limit their contribution of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Were our community to move towards this more ecofriendly, carfree way of life, we would not be alone.",0
"dear state senator, i believe that we should abolish the electoral college and just leave up to popular vote. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the U.S constitution.

The electoral college is unfair because it takes away the democratic way of society that our founding fathers set up. In the United States of America we leave it up to the people to vote but if the people of the united states vote someone in an he doesn get to run the country because the electoral college decided differently then we should not be called a democracy. For example in the 2000 election with Al Gore and Gorge W. Bush, the people of the united states voted for Al Gore, but due to the electoral college Bush won the election. in the passage The Indefensible Electoral College it says ""Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" what does that tell you? more then half of the USA would prefer a people vote instead of both!

furthermore, I believe we should due away with the electoral college because it poses a threat to the U.S constitution. when i say this i mean it is a threat to the citizens of the USA. the people of the united states were thought to vote our president in? but if the majority of voters vote for someone an the other opponent wins then where is the democracy in that? also in the article The Indefensible Electoral College says ""oh what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? it happened in hawaii in 1960. Luckily, vice president Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent's electors."" imagin if that happens again an someone doesn notice that? then there will be double slaters an there bound to vote for the same candidate so that will be an easy state to win for that candidate. The electoral college is nothing but problems.

In conclution, The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the U.S constitution. You make your conclution based on this Mr.",0
"Transportation has become one of the largest emissions throughout the world, and many do not seem to wonder how beneficial limiting car usage can be. Not only does the release of fossil fuels harm the world, but the stress that comes with having a vehicle is immense. When considering ownership of a vehicle, one must think about the pros and cons of owning one, and realize that the limited pros... are not worth the cons.

Cars, trucks, and buses have many factors in common, but one in particular is hazardous to mother nature... fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are harming our territory, the place where life has been made possible, Earth. At the streak we are going, soon enough us humans, the domain species won't have a home due to the pollutants vehicles release killing the Ozone Layer. We have become accustomed to the abuse of transportation. Even when we are capable of walking or using a bike to a nearby location, we choose to use a vehicle instead of avoiding the damage that is caused. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" Source 2 states. Their are many ways to distinguish transportation, but one very adequate description is ""a death wish"".

The stress that comes with the ownership of any transporting vehicle surpasses what anyone can bare! The economic standards one needs to posses is difficult. In, Vauban, Germany, one can have a car under the circumstances of paying 40,000 for a parking space, along with your home, source 1 explains. Your car needs to be fed in order to function, and it's food is quite pricey, especially when it hoards gallons of the substance! In addition, one needs to pay for insurance swell! Dangers in streets are not abnormal whatsoever, so the stressfulness that one has behind their back while driving is not enjoyable.",0
"We live in a world where the only way to get from place to place is to use a car. If we were to limit the amount of car usage all around the world we would be living in a much better place. Imagine how much pollution is going into the air as we use our cars, many people all around the world use their cars to get from their home to work or from work to home. All the pollution that is going into the air is affecting us and the way we live our everyday lives.

In the city of Bogota Columbia they have a ""Car Free Day."" This program is set to spread to other countries in the next few years. During the event of car free day millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work or to their home. This caused the streets of the capital city to devoid all the traffic jams that they normally would have with the cars on the road. You would think the turnout would be extremely small for this event but no it was definitely not a small turnout. The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that occasionally dumped rain showers on Bogota. ""The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Imagine if the United states were to have a ""Car free day"" not many people would actually come and be apart of the event due to the fact that having cars is one of the most important things to have living in the United States.

In other countries or cities the people are worried about the air pollution that is going into our atmosphere. In the city of Paris, officials feel the same way about the citizens of there city using there car way to much and polluting the atmosphere. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Not many people agreed with this ban when it started. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to reuters. Twenty Seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Except there are some advantages to this ban, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france. But the smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most populated cities in the world. Having rules or banning certain things like a partial driving ban could have a good turnout or a really bad turnout with the citizens of that particular country or city.

However, some people may say that limiting car usage or banning certain things like driving won't help at all. They may state that banning something will make people rebel against it especially if it's with their car, and if that is how they get from place to place. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm curtural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason the resume the habit. Poeple in the Untied States have begun to decrease the use of cars in every state which means that everyday our atmosphere becomes less polluted.

Living in a world where cars are everyone's number one priority is horrible. Using a car is one of the main reasons why our earth is extremely polluted. Limiting the amount of car use has it's negative side and it also has it's positive sides. Could you imagine what it would be like to have a nonpolluted earth or living a better life by using bikes, skates or even just walking to places would be like. Limiting car usage would be the best thing anyone could ever do to make the earth a better place.",0
"The long list of benefits that comes from limited car usage are mostly based on where you live and how much you do your part. Laws and restrictions have been arriving across the entire world to see the effects of having little or no automobiles in the community. Other countries that have an intense cloud of smog need to ban car use in the millions at a time to help settle down the atmosphere there.

Life without cars today can be very well described in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. In her article she describes how the community is shaped and condensed in order to make travelling to necessary places easy through walking or bike riding distance. This is the kind of turn around that the world needs as well. With the amount of pollution happening, this is a good experiment that will hopefully spread all over the planet.

The amount of pollution affecting certain cities across the world is getting rather out of hand. In Robert buffer's article Paris bans driving due to smog , he talks about the intense pollution over France's capital, resulting in the partial ban of almost of the amount of cars on the road at once. Those who violated the ban's rules were fined, and thousands of cars were impounded as well due the the reaction of citizens when they received the fine. In paragraph 14 of the article, Duffer states that "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France , after five days of intensifying smog."" The ban clearly worked, showing that it was indeed the heavy number of vehicles on the road all at once.

Programs all across the world have gotten people in the millions to find other methods of travel that did not cause any pollution. Columbia is a huge example as shown in Andrew Selsky's article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. In the article, Selsky specifies about how millions of Columbians have taken alternative modes of transport, whether it be hiking, biking, or skating as opposed to general driving. Even on account of rain, the citizens found ways to get about without using their cars. This is making Bogota a more human and social place as well, as Selsky states, "" Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" This event is happening for the good of the people and of the planet, and it seems like everyone is okay with that.

With the way our world is rapidly changing with a new generation and new technology, we are going to have to adapt from our old habits. Young adults are not seeing the full necessity of buying a vehicle when they can get to where they need to go by other means that are less expensive and less harmful to the environment. The need for everyone to have a car is slowly going down. It may never completely go away, but it is reducing greatly.",0
"The system of the Electoral College is a widely argued debate as to if it should be continued or if it should be gotten rid of. The electoral system shouldn't be used as a system of voting, who honestly wants to vote for someone who will vote for you, and if we are truly a state thats votes for its own president then why doesn't the popular vote count as the official vote?

The Electoral College is a system that is rather unfit as a system of the people's voting. When you vote for your president, you're really just voting for who you think should vote for them. The article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" states, ""...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for you candidate's electors."" The Constitution states that we are able to vote for our president, but then what do you call this? This is not an example of what America stands for, and this is certainly not the voting system that is described by our nation's properties. There is another issue with this violation of rights concerning our voting system, it's how the Electoral College votes and how dependable they are. The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong."" talks about how you can't control who the electoral you chose vote for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This statement helps prove that the president you may want may not even get you vote. The Electoral College not only takes away your right to assuringly vote for the president of your choice, but it also takes away right personal voting right as an American. Don't let someone else detain your freedom of speech, let you personal voice be heard by the people.

While the Electoral College may seem like a sure fire way to assure that we get a president, that doesn't really mean the majority wants that president. Think about it, we don't always get the president we voted for. Popular vote doesn't really matter, it's like saying you voice doesn't matter to the government. They took away the right as an American they gave you in the first place. Popular vote should replace the Electoral College. There have been instances where the popular vote reined supreme, but the Electoral College didn't agree. In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" it mentions an election where Al Gore lost even though he won the popular vote. ""...according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency..."" This helps show the people that it seems our vote isn't what is truly important, it's only what the Electoral College does that makes a true impact on choosing of president for the next two years. It's even stated in the very same article that, ""...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" If our vote truly matters then why not vote on keeping the Electoral College in play or getting rid of the flawed system once and for all.

The Electoral college is claimed to keep the voting system in line and prevent major mess, however this is not truly the case. There will still be flaws, but this is not the correct way to fix it. Listening strictly to the people's vote is what Amercia was built on and as an American I would like to see a change and let my voice be heard. If I want to vote I will vote, I don't want to vote on someone voting for me.

The Electoral College is unfair, unjust, and unamerican. The system takes away our right to vote for who we want not who we want to vote for us. If you are a true American you will understand why I know this is flawed. The Electoral College is not a proper way to handle our votes it must be a vote decided completely by the people of Amercia.",0
"Dear Senator, Many people might agree theat we shouldn't have an Electoral College at all, since most of thee time it doesn't seem to work at all since of instead just voting on thee person or candidate you would prefer, you instead vote for a slate of electors instead of thee preferred candidate. This is not thee case, however, and in fact, thee Electoral College does seem to function. It can be proven in two simple reasons on why thee Electoral College still works certainty of outcome and thee simple fact theat it's everyone's president.

Foremost, thee certainty of outcome can easily prove why thee Electoral College still works. If we even do go to a system where we actually vote for popular vote, it would work as well as we do right now withe thee Electoral College, since theere will be more disputes on popular vote thean on thee Electoral College. In Richard A. poster's article on thee defense for thee Electoral College, he states in his first reason on why theeir would be much dispute over popular vote thean on thee Electoral College, and why it's less likely to happen on a Electoral College. He states ""The reason is theat thee winning candidate's share of thee Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of thee popular vote."" It's true, after all theat thee Electoral College's votes exceed over thee popular votes. It could be also said theat even if thee government actually switches to popular vote, we know it would work since it does not exceed how on Electoral College votes go, which can be also seen as a simpler process of voting. On anotheer note, in some cases, theere can be ties between two candidates, as seen in 1992's Election between Nixon and Clinton on thee popular vote. To summarize, thee certainty of outcome is far greater in thee Electoral College ratheer thean thee popular vote due to sheer number of votes in thee Electoral College.

On a second note, thee fact theat thee american people can vote enough theat it's everyone's president is anotheer reason on why thee Electoral college does work. The Electoral College works by havng thee winner win transregionally ratheer thean just focus on just on region theat just favors theem and only theem. So instead of one region getting thee candidate theat prefers and focuses on only theem, everyone can have a candidate theat will focus largely on thee nation's issues ratheer thean just a specific part ot thee country. For example, let's say theat thee largest population of people in a regon in thee United States is thee southe not saying it is or isn't, it's just an example. The southe is mainly republican, so theey will only vote for a republican theat will focus majorly on thee southe. It is unfair for thee rest of thee regions, such as thee Northeeast, Middle, Pacific, and otheer regions of thee United States, since theey are mainly democratic not really, it is used as an example who would want focus on theeir region as well, too. In Bradford plumber's article on why thee Electoral College should be gone, he states theat thee electoral college is unfair to voters, since most candidates did not botheer withe thee states theey know theey have no chance of winning at all. There could be an easy counter argument against theis, since theose states have probably already made up theeir minds on who to vote for, like a democratic candidate visiting Texas where it's mainly republican, theey know who Texas is going to vote for, theere is no use in trying to convince theem when theey have already made up theeir minds, same goes if a republican candidate tries to convince thee democratic California, theey already know theere is no use in reasoning and convincing when someone has already made up theeir mind. Also, someone can easily counterattack most of thee arguments brought up in the plumber's article, since theis was written before thee 2004 election, and it has been a decade already, plenty of theings could've changed during thee course if ten years in politics. In order to make a greater argument against thee electoral college, one must have an updated list of facts in order to back it up, as certain theings could've changed during a certain course of a decade. During thee course of a decade, we seen how affective thee electoral college was during thee 2004 elections people who disagreed during thee 2004 elections and also agree theat thee electoral college doesn't work at all have to see thee events theat transpired before thee 2004 elections and thee promises made before it also, thee 2008 elections again, if thee people disagreed on how thee electoral college worked at theat time, you would need to look at how people saw change during theat time and thee amount of younger citizens voting at theat time, and thee 2012 elections as well also again, if disagreeing withe thee electoral college is reasonable at theat time, you would need to look at how people reacted at theat time and how different events before thee election affected thee outcome. In a final note, thee electoral college is thee vote on thee people's president is true, and witheholds it since it can focus on ratheer thean on one specific region, but thee nation as a whole.

In summarization, thee electoral college should be kept due to thee simple reasoning of certainty of outcome and thee voting on thee people's president. The reasoning of certainty of outcome can be applied here is due to thee simple fact theat thee votes for thee electoral college are far more greater thean thee votes for popular vote, same goes to thee voting on thee people's president, since it focuses on thee entire nation ratheer theat just one region of thee country. Senator, we should be able to keep our electoral college, as it proves effective during thee recent elections, and can certainly prove itself useful and reliable during thee next elections to come.",0
"In the old world, people didn have car's, they did everything on foot. They got food, ran errands, and just to get out of the house with the family. So how come now adays people are so dependent on their car's. Places around the world are implementing rules or laws now to stop people from abusing the car.

Since the car was invented it has always had the same issue, not the engine or the interior, but the environmental issue. And now that people around the world are realizing that, they have created rules and laws to ban or reduce the usage of cars. A community in Germany called Vauban have given up their car's to help the environment, and people love it. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two.

Paris ""The Love City"" in France has Banned cars because of the high amount of smog it creates. After the law was placed, only after five days, congestion was down 60 percent.

Paris has the most smog compared to any other European capitals, they had to do this or the smog would take over the city. And since the ban has been posted, smog has been clearing and is now much more limited in the area.

Major cities like New York were built in a narrow way, so its more congested when too many people are driving, and the buildings are much closer together so its more continent to walk or bike to places rather than drive. New York has implemented a new bikesharing program, and it is a hit. And around the nation a similar program is the carsharing program. It encourages people about car pulling, it is when multiple people go to work or school in the same car, it puts less cars on the road and has plentiful benefits. Like less carbon dioxide in the air, less traffic, and saves on gas money.

Bill Ford, an executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, pitched a plan to live in a world that owning a personal car was impractical. He proposed to partnering with telecommunications industry to make a city or many where the ""pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" Banning cars around the world isn't a solution because they are more continent than taking a train or walking, but their needs to be a cut down on the amount we use a car, we abuse it. Eventually all the greenhouse gases might end up destroying the planet we live on. But their are solutions, implementing a world day were we dont use cars would help tremendusly, their are other means of getting around other than car. For example Biking is a great form of excersice and will get you to were you need to be faster than walking, while getting in shape at the same time.",0

The Electoral College is a very controversial topic when it comes to electing a president. Many people think it's a system that works fine, while others think it's a complete disaster. When it comes down to it, the Electoral College is a compromise between electing a president through congress and electing president by popular vote. In the past the Electoral College has caused problems in presidential elections and it can easily cause more problems that are much more severe than what we've seen in the past. America is all about democracy, so why don't the citizens get complete control by being able to elect their president directly? It's about time that the government finds a system that works better and gets rid of the Electoral College once and for all.

The electoral College has many flaws, a major one being that voters don't actually vote for their president, they vote for electors, and the electors are the ones who elect the president. You may ask yourself, ""What's wrong with this? One way or another we're still choosing the candidate we want."" While that is somewhat true, the system has many kinks that need to be fixed causing errors in the process. One example of this is the ""winner takes all"" rule. An excerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" says ""... the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"". At a basic level, this means candidates will only focus on some states, and giving up on others. In fact, the same article also says ""During the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't see the candidates at all..."" The facts prove it it, the Electoral College is a flawed, and unfair system, and it needs to be dealt with.

Another huge problem with the Electoral College is called ""the disaster factor"". According to Bradford Plumer, "" The American poeple should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" Plumer then explains how in Louisiana the legislature almost replaced the democratic candidates with some who opposed John F. Kennedy so that the popular vote wouldn't go to him, but rather someone else. This is a fine example of how corrupt this system can become if someone actually manages to pull something like this off. Other problems like a state sending two slates of electors to congress, or a tie in the electoral vote can happen, and there are some solutions to these problems, but why even go through them when a new system can be created altogether?

People like Richard A. Posner argue that we should keep the Electoral college. Posner believes that the Electoral College balances the weight between big and small states. The Electoral College gives big states less electoral votes and smaller states more to balance things out. I don't see this as balancing anything. Now the smaller states have an advantage over the bigger states, so you still have the same problem you began with. Posner also argues that voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to campaigns, but Plumer clearly contradicts this in his article. He states ""... seventeen states didn't see the campaign at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad."" The proof is irrefutable, the Electoral College has it's loop holes which seem fairly easy to get through. The system is outdated, it's time for a new system to take its spot.

I stand my ground when I say the Electoral College should ber abolished. The people should have full control over the election of our president, and even if that's not possible, the system is very corrupt. While some still agrue that the Electoral College is working fine, the proof shows it isn't. It either needs to be renewed or replaced altogether.",0
"Dear Florida State Senator, Although many could argue that the Electoral College is a fair system of deciding the president, far too many people consider it nondemocratic and inefficient for it it continue being our way of electing our leader. A new system of election must be created to make up for the pitfalls that are inevitable in the Electoral College. A country that is supposed to be a democracy does not have the voting system that such a proud democracy deserves.

Defenders of the College may say that the possibility of a tie is very low or that the electors chosen are confirmed not to betray the wants of the voters, but just because the possibility is low does not mean you can simply allow the flaws in the voting system to exist. A small hole in a fabric can only grow bigger, and the same goes for our electoral college. If we can't repair or replace the fabric that is our Electoral College, soon there will be problems too big for us to deal with in our current state. The electoral voters may keep the public in mind for now, but there have already been cases where electoral voters put their own wants ahead of the public.

One thing that the Electoral College does not promote is the power in the hands of the people. Although people can vote for whatever candidate they want, the elector is the real deciding hand in the process of picking our president. If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely nondemocratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote.

Besides the power it takes away from the common man, some could say that the system itself is very inefficient compared to what it could be. Even though it has a very low possibility, the fact is that a tie is possible due to the electoral college having an even number of votes. It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future.

The Electoral College may be functional, but is largely inefficient and is not in the best interest of the common people. The vote for a candidate is not even in the hands in the people, but rather a minority of chosen electors. In a country that prides itself on the power the people have, and the control they have on how their country is run, the people have surprisingly less influence than you would think. We as a people need to speak up against the overrated system that is the Electoral College, and develop a system that fits the needs of a true democracy like America should be.",0
"Thousands of people around the world use cars. It's an allaround good mode of transportation. Unfortunately, the fumes that cars emit are harmful for the environment. There are ways to limit car usage. Limiting car usage has many benefits such us the decrease in greenhouse house gas, the decrease in smog, and resources are conserved.

First off, reducing the usage of cars can cut the amount of greenhouse gas produced dramatically. One can easily cut down on car usage by using other means of transportation such as : riding bike, riding the train, and plain walking. Greenhouse gas emissions are very harmful and are mostly caused by car emissions. Around fifty percent of passenger cars are responsible for these gasses source 1. If we limit car usage we can promote a healthier environment.

Additionally, reducing car usage also cuts down smog. Smog is another deadly gas that isnt just dangerous to the environment, but also to us. Smog is polluted air which can cause sickness. Many cities around the world are increasing in smog due to the overusage of cars. For example Paris almost broke the record for polluted air, which is held by China, one of the most polluted cities in the world source 2. If we reduce the usage of cars, we promote cleaner air for ourselves. Just by limiting the car usage for five days in Paris, the smog went down sixty percent source 2. The advantage of limiting car usage would be cleaner air.

Finally, limiting car usage is beneficial because it conserves resources. If we dont rely on cars, we could make cities more compact source 1. Therefore reducing the amount of land destroyed to build malls, highways, and houses. This would save tons of resources that were going to be used on building and natural resources source 4. Limiting car usage would improve life all around.

All in all, the limit on car usage would benefit the environment, it would benefit our health, and it would aid the conservation of resources.",0
"Although numerous amounts of people want to banish the Electoral College, there are more rights than wrongs about it. The Electoral College is in the Constitution for an enormous reason it is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of qualified citizens. This process allows for the people of the nation to have a say and for the elected people of each state to speak even louder for their state. The Electoral College is despised, yet it is the smartest way on how to elect the President.

The Electoral College requires for a president to have transregional appeal. For example, rodney was a solid favorite in the South, but he cannot win with only the votes from the South because no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. While rodney did not have to campaign much for the South, he had to campaign very heavily in the North to increase his chances of election in those states. This is an amazing result because the people want a president that is liked throughout the nation, so while he is president he can be a hugely successful one. candidates mainly focus on swing states, and dont have a lot of time for states they know they are going to win or lose however, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing they are the ones to decide the election. These voters in swing states are averagely the most thoughtful voters, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College should be kept because it almost always goes in favor of the people. Even though in the 2000 election Al Gore got the popular vote but George W. Busch won the electoral votes, that has not happened since 1888! The party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Many people want to change the election for the President to popular vote, but it would be more likely to have a dispute over the popular vote than in the electoral college. Also, there could be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the total number of votes is an even number, but it is tremendously unlikely given that there has never been a tie. Also, the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the voter's cast.

The Electoral College can be argued to repel potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state, for example, republicans in California on the other hand, every voter's vote plays a big part to their state's electoral vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. The Electoral College has worked for more than a century and will keep on working if the people of the nation agree to work with it.",0
"There are many different things that you could do to help out the ecosystem, and reducing your car use is certainly one of them. A study conducted in Europe shows that 12% of greenhouse gas emissions are the result of passenger car overuse. But of course as humans we are bound to resist and not give up things that make our lives easier. Yet there are many alternatives to not driving a car, for example car pool, have family members pick you up, buses, trains, taxis, bikes, etc. As you can see is not a matter of lack of alternatives but a lack of interest in helping out nature and everything that it helps support.

A very important way in which car usage affects our lives is pollution, many places around the world are trying to impose taxes and fines in order to keep people from overrelying on their cars. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", things like this are quite obviously why the ecosystem is not at it's worst yet. One of the most polluted cities in the world Beijing competition for Paris until law enforcers stepped in to resolve the issue. Another city fighting pollution caused by car use is Bogota, who has once again banned it's over 7.2 million population from using their cars on the ""Day Without Cars"" event. The Day Without Cars is an event that if not followed could be penalize citizens most likely monetary fines of around 25 dollars, although some were even arrested for not complying with this method. Described by Andrew Selsky as a ""program set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during this car free day"". Not only is this helping out the rest of the world is bringing people closer as more people go to parks, sport centers and spend time together.

With more bans and restrictions on car usage of course the car usage is destined to decrease but although it might sound terrible it could actually lead to healthier lives. With less cars on the road the air you are breathing will be more pure and healthy and less polluted. More people will have to walk which will decrease heart problems, obesity and other diseases all over the world. If people don't buy cars then companies like Ford, Toyota, Honda and more will make less money and some might run out of business but that will not happen since most people are not ready to make a commitment such as giving up your car. But if cars are not being purchased then they will stop being produced which can lead to a better economy since the government won't be spending billions on gas, diesel and such. Apparently the amount of miles driven by a person yearly has decreased over the last couple of years which has led sociologists to believe that if this pattern persists it will have many beneficial implications for the environment, even though it could have negative implications for car industries as i stated before.

Car usage will decrease since people are driving less and less every year and young people are buying less cars according to a study in 2013 that found that ""driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009"". Even though many experts can't be sure yet, the drop in sales and decrease in usage has led many to believe that the U.S. has already peaked in miles driven and possibly car sales. There is no accurate way of predicting whether this will bring completely positive or completely negative consequences. President Obama's ambitious goals to change the greenhouse gas emissions has proven to shift or change the way people act as recent studies show that ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"".",0
"Dear Senator, The Electoral College as controversial as it is can be a very simple choice to either keep it as it is, or to change the voting process to a popular vote process that in which the people vote directly for the President of their choosing. I believe that you should consider changing the Electoral College to a Popular vote voting process for reasons such as, the fact that only ""one half of Americans are voting"" because they do not believe that their vote will count in states such as California and Texas because the voters do not believe that the candidate will carry their state anywhereIn Defense of the Electoral College section 23. Another reason is because of the winnertakeall system the candidates will not campaign as much in states they think they will win over without going there and they focus on the ""swing states"" instead.

Senator, one of the reasons that I believe you should consider changing to the Popular Vote process is because ""only one half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election""In Defense of the Electoral College section 23 for reasons I believe is that they do not think that the candidate running will go somewhere with their state and the fact that they do not think their votes will actually count towards the President that they would like to win. Also the fact that segreagationists will try and corrupt the voting process in the Electoral College, i. e. When John F. Kennedy was running for President segregationists tried to replace Democratic Electors with other electors to try and go against Kennedy therefore giving the opponent the upper handThe Indefensible Electoral College Section 11.

Senator, on the contrary I would understand why you would like to keep the Electoral College because of it being a set compromise that the founding fathers created, making voting equal by letting ""qualified citizens in congress"" have the last word into the decision What is the Electoral College Section 1. In a way I see how you would think that the Electoral College is a fair system because the people are still choosing somewhat who the Electoral College elects and the fact that anachronism is a factor that plays into the Electoral College greatlyIn Defense of the Electoral College Section 15. The Electors elected should be trusted truthful people and they are to vote for the nominee in honest fact of who got the most electoral votesIn Defense of the Electoral College Section 16 but sometimes even if the electoral votes are calculated and are higher the popular vote could be higher than the electoral vote even if its a rare occuranceIn Defense of the Electoral College Section 16.

Senator, as you see both sides of this controversy you could also see that the Winnertakeall method is all in all unfair. In the winnertakeall method the candidates that are in the election will take more time to go to the bigger states and try and have ads for their campaign posted in there and not in the littler states they believe they will win without campaigning there. The candidates will focus even more on the ""swing states"" because they believe they will have more luck in those states than the other smaller states. ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad""What is wrong with the Electoral College Section 13 this fact goes to show that the candidates would rather focus more on the larger states and ""swing states"" than go to the smaller states this makes those smaller states less encouraged to vote because the candidates don't even bother to come to them to campaign.

Senator, in the end I strongly believe that you should think about changing the Electoral College to a Popular Vote process because it will give the voters an incentive for them to vote, for them to decide who wins and who will run their state or country. Power to the People has always been a great thought to keep running around in your brain for me.",0
"In the generation we are living in today cars are a huge part of our everyday lives. Whether it's going to schoolwork, hanging with friends or anywhere really people rely on their cars for everything and you never hear anyone talk about walking, biking and taking another way of transportation. It's whole new era with how are society is created and working but it's how we are living, and it seems to be working. Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky all have the same mindset when talking about cars while each are talking about a different reason to decrease car usage, they all have a common interest in wanting it to be implied or simply like how it is being enforced. So after reading very specific, factual, and information articles I now know the advantages of limiting car usage and that is to save time and businesses, conserve resources, and having a vast decrease in car culture.

Imagine yourself on a bad morning, you woke you late and you're probably rushing out the door for work, and as a fellow American I would know that there is early morning traffic no matter where you are headed. But if you didn't use a car and maybe walked or rode a bike you could easily get there faster if it was a reasonable distance. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets fo this capital city eerily to devoid of traffic jams"" Selsky, par 20. This goes to show that when people took other steps to get to work instead of cars that there was no traffic jams. Which means no waitng which also means getting to work at a normal time, or for some, even on time. When you think about it you know that the roads can be a really busy and hetic place to be if you time it just right, so if you take the extra measure and maybe walk home you can easily make faster time and not just that but it helps the environment. Now another advantage of not using cars is businesses start to flourish. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Selsky, par 28. Since many people have decided not to use their cars they walk or bike and that can lead to going to places near by which would mean they see more of their city than they did in a car. More eyes are to catch businesses and they find themselves walking into a store because they aren't rushed andor it might just look intersting which is a huge benefit for companies.

Secondly, another advantage on limiting car usage would be conserving resources. This is a very major step when it comes to the environment and things like these should be enforced for a greener Earth. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Rosenthal, par 5. This is damaging our Earth and the only to prevent it is to limit your car use. Because how it's happening and how it's polluting our Earth is from the cars tailpipes when it releases the exhaust. Due to this hazardly problem laws are starting to be made to limit the use. Towns and cities have tried to come up with a nodriving day to decrease the use and help the environment, and in many cases it has worked while in some, it hasn't. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" Duffer, par 10. In effect to this 'experiment' it is shown that this way of thinking had changed Paris pollution decreased and congestion in traffic was down and the smog that was being created by cars had stopped the next couple of days. It's unbelievable to know what can happen when you limit yourself.

Finally, it is clear that there is a decrease in car culture. There have been recent studies that imply that more Americans aren't driving or just plain out don't want to get their licenses. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..."" Rosenthal, par 41. We aren't really understanding as to why this is happening. Maybe it's because they are afraid of getting a ticket, their parents haven't allowed it, they are against pollution it's not known. But what we do know is that yes, it's saving the environment but it's hurting the car businesses. ""If the pattern presists and many sociologists believe it will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emission, just behind power plants"" Rosenthal, par 34. Yes, this is going to increasingly better our enivornment by not having more cars on the road to pollute, but it will for sure hurt the car industry. Not many people even have the money to go out a buy a car in this economy. And from the car businesses in ruins, some are even rebranding themselves. The change in car culture is known for much less commuting due to technology as well.

Lastly, a reminder of the advantages in limiting car usage are saving time and businesses, conserving resources and a decrease in car culture. So when you're on the road, start thinking about ways to stop your use of cars and see how it would benefit the environment cause the more we drive around the worse our Earth will become.",0
"We should keep the Electoral College for a number of reasons. While it is usually thought of as ""out of place"", it is the fairest method in voting for our President. The Electoral College, first of all, the outcome of the Electoral vote is less likely to cause a dispute than the popular vote. Second, avoids the problem of RunOff Elections. Last, the Electoral College helps balance the political weight for large states by population. We need the Electoral College so not create any problems.

The outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely to cause a dispute than the popular vote. The number of electoral votes a candidate gets usually exceeds his popular vote. For example, ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent on the popular votes cast for him and rodney."" Since most of the states have a ""winnertakeall"" system, its easier to determine which candidate gets the electoral vote if there is a plurality in the state. A tie in the electoral vote is possible, but not very likely, even if the total is an even number. Voting based on the popular vote would just cause more problems than we would like to deal with.

RunOff Elections are avoided because of the Electoral College. RunOff elections are elections that are caused when neither candidate receives a majority of the votes given. As the article states, ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370 Electoral Votes"". The Electoral College clearly shows who wins without any complications that would create pressure for runOff Elections. We are releived of this pressure because we have the Electoral College.

Finally, the Electoral College helps balance the weight that large states lose because of I urge this country to continue with the Electoral College as it always has! There may be better methods out there, but the Electoral College is the best system we have right now.",0
"I beam, flashing a smile towards the camera of my mom's iPhone. In my hand, I grip a fourbythree inch square of plastic that, in my perspective, is synonymous with freedom. It's the moment every kid dreams about, lying bellydown on the kitchen floor and pushing a Barbie jeep around their mother's feet as she labors away at the stove, the stark scent of garlic filling their little noses. Finally, I got my driver's license! While definitely a defining moment of adolescence, most teenagers refuse to acknowledge the degrading qualities of driving. Limiting car usage has a multitude of benefits, such as decreasing air pollution and improving the health and quality of life of the world's people.

As a new driver, there is nothing I despise more than waking up to severe smog, squinting as I corral my vehicle down blurred roadways en route to school. By utilizing my own vehicle, however, I am adding to the problem. Smog and other forms of unaesthetic air pollution are caused in part by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars tailpipe. In the United States, passenger cars are responsible for up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. Source 1 Another large percentage of these emissions comes from the inefficient, energywasting, carbonspewing processes required to create gasoline and diesel fuel. Essentially, we emit large amounts of greenhouse gases to produce fuel for our vehicles which, in turn, release more greenhouse gases. As an AP Environmental Science student, I know better than anyone the degrading results of excessive greenhouse gases. As these particles accumulate in the atmosphere, light from the sun, including harmful ultraviolet rays, stays trapped in our planet, causing a gradual rise in average temperature. This process is known as global warming. Besides being dangerous to our planet, air pollution is unappealing visualy to all inhabitants of Earth. Smog once reached such high levels in Paris, the capital of France, that a partial driving ban was placed on the city to purify the air. After one day of diminishing the number of cars on the roads by 50%, the smog had cleared enough for civilians to continue their daily activities. Source 2 The grotesque images associated with smog can harm Paris' economy tourists want to view the Palace of Versailles with a tear in their eye from its beauty, not from the sting of air pollutants.

Limiting car usage also has a variety of physical and psycological benefits that improve the health of earth's people. For example, a suburban community in Germany, known as Vauban, has gone completely carfree. 57% of Vauban's residents sold a car to move in and, so far, the majority of them seem to be enjoying the benefits. Heidrun Walker, a media trainer and mother of two, is one of them. ""When I had a car, I was always tense,"" she said, ""I'm much happier this way."" Source 1 Walker's statement shows the improved psychological wellbeing of those who do not rely on cars for the majority of their transportation. Decreased reliance on motor vehicles can also improve the physical health of humanity. Without personalized vehicles for transportation, many people will walk, jog, bike, or skate to their various destinations. Such a phenomenon occurs annually in Bogota, the capital of Columbia. Every year, they host a ""Day Without Cars"", during which Columbians rely on their own two feet to move about their sprawling city. Source 3 Physical activities such as walking have a variety of benefits, including increased cardiovascular health. If more countries hosted events similar to Bogota's ""Day Without Cars"", emergency rooms may find they have less clogged arteries to deal with.

Limiting car usage has many pros, including decreased air pollution and increased mental and physical wellbeing of the world's people. The next time you unlock your car to drive two minutes to your friend's house, stop and consider the consequences of your actions. Consider the health of yourself and your planet, and try walking instead.",0
"Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.The Senate would choose the vicepresident. Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.",0
"The Electoral College is a very useful and easy was of voting. According to thee article ""What Is thee Electoral College"" by thee Office of thee Federal Register, ""The Electoral College process consists of thee selection of the electors, thee meeting of thee electors where theey vote for President and Vice President, and thee counting of thee electoral votes by Congress."" Basically we vote for our electors which theen theey vote for thee President which seem to be working just fine why change it?

There are many resons why people are in favor of changing thee Electoral College for popular vote. In thee article ""Why even thee bestlaid defenses of thee system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer he asks ""Can voters control whom theeir electors vote for?"" Then answers himself withe ""Not always."" This may be true but voters do get to vote for theier electors and it is thee voters job to vote for thee one theey believe will choose thee right president. The people need to put faithe in theier electors, and even if thee Electoral College was changed to popular vote theey would have to vote for thee president and put faithe in him or her to make thee right decisions for theem, is theey same basic theing but having electors are just anotheer step.

""The Electoral College restores some of thee weight in thee political balance theat large states by population lose by virtue of thee malapportionment of thee Senate decreed in thee Constitution"" This was stated in thee article "" Five reasons to keep our despised metheod of choosing thee President"" by Richard A. Posner. This is a very good point he made, thee larger states get more attention thean thee smaller states when it comes to popular voting in presidential elections because theey have a much larger population giving theem more votes.

When it comes to popular voting theere have been times where no candidate has a majority cast of votes and thee Electoral College Prevents theat problem. In 1968 Nixon received 43 percent plurality or more votes thean thee otheer candidates but still not receving a clear majority of votes in thee popular votes same withe Clinton in 1992 but theey bothe won majority in thee electoral College, so theere was no need for and runoff election.

I believe theat we shouldn't change thee Electoral College for popular votes thee way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on thee election because of theier population thean smaller states like Rhode Island. Also thee Electoral College prevents Runoff elections. Even theough some believe thee Electoral College as an anachronism I theink theat thee Electoral College is still a good way of voting.",0
"""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"" ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"". Most supporters of the Electoral College don't understand that electors are not always honest, just because people vote for the elector that is for the presidential candidate they favor of doesn't garentee the electors vote. ""What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral College!"" ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"". People want to eliminate The Electoral College, and change to election for President of the United States to election by the popular vote. The public is not voting for their presidential candidate, they are voting for the foisting electors, and in the case of a tie, the House Of Representatives are thrown the election, where people are not proportionally represented.

Furthermore, voting for electors is not the same as voting for the presidential candidate. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes"" ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"". This process called ""The Electoral College"" is faulty and not efficacious people are constantly deceived that they are voting for the presidential candidate, but as shown this is not always true. Not to omit anything, voters don't choose who the electors are, so who can garentee their loyalty, honesty, and the fulfillment of the will of the people. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy."" ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"". The deception and deferment can not be more evident and clear. The Electoral College is not a stable foundation to rely our country on. ""In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"". Their deferment and inevitable deception is clear and pellucid The Electoral College should not be trusted! The people should vote!

In continuation, in the case of a tie in electoral votes the House of Representative would be responsible for choosing the president and vice president, but their method is just as outrageous as The Electoral College. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"". In what world in this sensible, sane, or intellegent? Well, it seems this ubsurd representation can be found on a planet called Earth, whose inhabitants claim to be intellectual beings. ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968 a shift of just 41,971 voters would have deadlocked the election In 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from a castastrophe"" ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"". People are told that ""voting makes a difference"", but with all these false representations, can people continue to say this without becoming a liar themselves. With all these holes in the ship, howcome The Electoral College hasn't sunken yet. The majority is in favor of switching the process of election for President of the United States to election by the popular vote.

To conclude, the transition from ""The Electoral College"" to election by the popular vote for the President of the United States would be the best thing for this beloved country. Voting for electors is not the same as voting for the desired candidate, and in the case of a tie the House of Represenatives unproportionally represent the will and voice of the people. Voters should be allowed to vote and be represented justly, and not defied and deceived into voting incorrectly or indirectly. Let the people be heard, when they chant in unicen: ""Let us Vote"". The president who says he is ""For the people"" should be chosen ""By the people"".",0
"In the following ideas and information passage set we see the effects of using cars too much and how limiting our car use can have a huge impact on, not only our environment, but also on cities on people. Limiting our car usage isn't only a thing that the United States has to work on, but we see that Central America and Europe also has to work on it. Limiting our car usage isn't a small issue, but more of a global issue. Over the years we have seen the effects of global warming something cause by fossil fuels, which is gas coming from our cars and how they have had an enormous impact on our world. So, why is liming our car usage even remotely important to us?

In the second article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", paragraph 10, the first thing it says is ""After days of nearrecord pollution.."", well, what does this say about how we're living today? Paris so close to to being on record breaking pollution, not that it's anything to be proud of. But, if that's how much pollution Paris has, which is a famous city for not only being the ""City of Love"", but for also being big, how will every other city's pollution be? Cities have been growing and expanding so much recently, factories are being built and more cars are being sold, how will this help limiting our car usage? If cities keep expanding, we'll just be adding to the pollution that already exists. After a couple decades all the issues we seem to be ignoring will come up and if the problems are bad now, how bad will they be in the future? This isn't just something we can ignore!

Like David Goldberg says in paragraph seven in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car.."". Why have we been focusing more on a car than on health and medicine and cures for some illnesses? Why is a car so important? Yes it makes going to places much more easier and quicker, but at what cost will we go to to make things easier on us? It isn't jsut about the pollution caused from our cr usage, but it's also about our health. There are fewer and fewer parks by the year because we'd rather have all our tax money go towards roads instead parks. More malls are opening up and more fast food places are opening up on big interstates and highways, and now all we really have to being close to nature is when we pass by the trees near the interstates and highways. We need trees in order to have oxygen, but if all this pollution is slowly killing trees, how much more time do we have left before we realize it's too late to try saving our trees and limiting our car usage? Back then no one really worried much about limiting our car usage and pollution, because it wasn't that bad. Now all you ever really hear is about pollution and how to stop it.

Even though we really have got to start limiting our car usage, there is still hope in lowering and or even stopping pollution. We could start off small, for instance, by having a day where no one is allowed to drive their cars to places or be fined if you do drive, like Bogota, Colombia does in ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". It must've had a positive effect because it encouraged Cali and Valledupar, two other Colombian cities, to participate in the event as well.",0
"I was very excited about my first trip to the West Coast California that I took last summer. It was a place Ive always fantasized over because of its variety of beauty from the surfing beaches to the skiing mountains to the north. When I first landed in LA, I expected some hustle and bustle of the city like Miami, but it was overwhelming to see the smog and traffic that polluted many peoples views of California, along with the air. Unfortunately, this is the case in many car intensive cities across the globe where limiting car usage would go a great deal farther than people actually know. The advantages of limiting car usage would allow for cleaner cities with less air pollution, and provide safety for pedestrians and even other carusers.

According to source 1 on carfree cities, Elizabeth Rosenthal states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas of the United States"" Rosenthal, paragraph 5. This stat only presents part of the problem as the commercial and delivery industry add to that figure as well. Limiting car usage across the world is becoming more and more popular, as people finally come to realize the devastating effects of the greenhouse gas emissions on the atmosphere. Projects in places like France, Colombia, the United States, and other countries across the globe are making a huge effort at reducing car usage, and according to source 4 by Rosenthal, they seem to be working. "" Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by""paragraph 29. Obviously, car usage altogether will not end, but limiting it can do a great deal in protecting the only planet sustainable for human life.

Furthermore, limiting the use of cars in areas of large pedestrian population, such as New York City, would ultimately lead to less tragic car accidents. Approximately 500 car accidents occur daily in the United States and probably upwards of 5000 across the globe. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in many societies which is unfortunate because almost all are preventable. Its when the driver is given too much power behind the wheel that their guard is let down. The rise of cellphones and texting have not helped the situation at all either. The good news is that the programs used worldwide solely for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are also reducing car accidents. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" Duffer, paragraph 14. Also in source 3 describing Bogota's Car free day is spreading to other countries of LatinAmerica with the intention of reducing traffic and allowing safer passage for pedestrians.

Ultimately, the importance of limiting carusage across the world is being seen as crucial and is starting to take off. Limiting car usage reduces air pollution which is a serious threat to humanity these days, and also diminishes car related accidents. At the end of my trip to California, I was able to see the real beauty of the nature outside the city, when I got off the highway.",0
"Do you know why the earth has air pollution ? they are many reason from cars. Limiting car usage could have many advances because it can slow down air pollution,save money, and safety. Sit back and relax while I explain.

To begin one of the advantages of limiting car usage is that it can slow down air pollution.

First reason that limiting car usage is that it can slow down air pollution is that because in the passage it says that ""after days of nearrecord pollution,Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" what that quote was basically saying was that the air pollution in paris was so terrible that they had to ban driving in order for the air to get stabilized. Next limiting car usage can slow down car pollution because it will keep major fuel companies from burning coal into the air. Lastly limiting car usage can slow down air pollution by using bikes,walking,taking the bus,riding skate boards,taking the subway,and ect.

Next one of the advantages of limiting car usage is it saves money.

the first reason limiting car usage saves money is because in one of the passages it says that ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. violaters are to face 25 fines"". and I dont think any one want to be a part of that. Next one of the advantages of limiting car usage is that it saves money because when a person has a car they spend lots on money to put gas in their car every week and every year gas prices are rising. finally one of the advantages on limiting car usage is it saves money is because people that drive have to be aware of tickets that are very expensive also mantanace for your car like tires, lights,oil and ect if you limit your car usage over time you will see yourself spending less.

Finally one advantage on limiting car usage is safety. The first reason lmiting car usage can raise safety is because in the passage it says ""pedestrian,bicycle,private cars,commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time,conserve resouses,lower emissions and improve safety"". The next reason limiting car usage can bring safety is by stoping traffic jams and droping the percentage of the amount of people dying fron car accidents. The final reason limiting car usage can bring safety keeping motorcyclists,bikers,and pedestrians from getting hit by cars also keeping drunk drivers of the streets.

To sum up they are many advantages of limiting car usage ,my reasons are it can slow down air pollution,save money, and safety I told you my reasons now tell me yours.",0
"To access what one needs in the world today, many would think one needs a car. Currently, cars are a big part of transportation for many people. However, they are also major contributes to negative environmental impact as well as the decline of cities public areas and transportation. Contrary to popular belief, limiting car usage can be beneficial to many. Currently, throughout the world several car free systems are operating well. A decrease in the number of cars on streets and highways would lead to positive improvements in public spaces, public transportation, and the environment as a whole.

Automobiles are one of the biggest ailments to the sustainment of a healthy environment. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", author Elisabeth Rosenthal shares the story of Vauban, Germany and their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" The impact of these gas emissions is incredibly negative on cities. They make the environment unstable and unsafe for a large number of people. These numbers could easily be reduced if fewer people chose to rely on cars as their mode of transportation. In some places the pollution caused by automobiles is so high that the government is stepping in to assist in the management of city spaces. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", author Robert Duffer explains this specific situation in Paris, France. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" The effects of this temporary ban were also shared. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" It is easy to see that just a small reduction of vehicles created a significant change.

The reduction of cars also leads to development. In ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, improvements to Bogota, Colombia as a result of less car usage is expaned upon. ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up."" Cities are beggining to cater to the needs of those who don't use cars. Their negative impact on city streets is finally being recognized, and many are taking action to improve aspects where they live other than roads. In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author discusses the goals of the United States and its major figures to reduce total reliance on cars. In this article Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company shares his hopes. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected netowork to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Many are striving to make public spaces more accessable to those who choose more concious methods of transport.

As many begin to see the importance of car reduction, they are becoming less reliant. In ""The End of Car Culutre"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal the decreasing numbers of people getting licenses and cars is discussed. ""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis done by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment reseach comapny."" In this article, the disregard full time use of vehichles is also shown. ""The Internet makes telecommunicating possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn epty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit."" People today can get access to a vehicle on command. Different resources make the constant use of cars unneccesary.

The decrease in usage of and reliance on cars is important and positively impactful. As number of cars on the road continues to go down, so do global issues such as the deterioration of the environment. Communities grow to orient themselves around public spaces accessable to all. Getting a significant number of automobiles off the road plays a huge role in inciting change that benefits a wide array of people in the way of work, time, money, and more, in communities and worldwide.",0
"Though I have not been alive to see most of it, I am sure that the debate on keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for ages. Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for many reasons. One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country. Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might win, or not win, simply for being a regional favorite.

To start this off, if our president was decided by a popular vote, our president might not be the best thing for our country. As stated in the third article, paragraph 20, ""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates... to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states."" As you know, tossup state's make the final vote. Therefore, people in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, and they will be the ones with the most information. If it were up to popular vote, then anyone over the age of 18 could randomly pick a winner. Let's be honest, the majority of eighteen year old's will vote on whoever their friends or family vote for, or even the candidate representing their group Democratic or Republic. Many people, if the president was decided by popular vote, would make an uneducated decision on one of the candidates, not studying their choices as much as one would with the Electoral College system in place.

Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might simply win because he or she is a regional favorite. As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ""...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take rodney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. rodney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winnertakeall"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president.

Now, of course, the other view has to be adressed. As stated in the second article, ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This quote shows that the candidates might not go to a state they know they have no chance in winning. I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.

In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man or woman might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.",0
"By limiting car usage you would be making it a healther environment, and a safer one!

there would be less pollution in the air and that would make the air better for us to breath.

Sure by limiting the usage of cars would have an effect on people its also doing us a favor wether we like it or not, because constantly breathing in polluted air is really bad for you it can have major affects on our lungs, and respotory system. Also by limiting car usage you wouldent spend so much money on gas, oil, car parts,ect:, so by saving all that money you could spent it on something else.

When you own a vehicle you put in so much money in just getting your insurance and then you spend so much money on gass every week, dont get me wrong the gas prices have gone down but what will happen when they go back up and how much money will the gas be then?

So is driving worth killing your air and the environment you live in and spend all your money on gas?

Or would it better for us to start imiting our car usage?

But that is up for you to decide what you want to do.

Whe driving have you ever thought how much pollution you vehicle is dishing out while your driving around town? Probably not, probably you where thinking how log till i get there or i need to text someone back but i bet not once did car pollution ever cross you mind and its okay not alot of people think about it when there driving. Actually hardly anyone thinks abot it ever unless its on the news saying that the air pollution is bad again and thats when you start to think about it.

With car pollution ypu dont realse what it is dont to you environment because you never see it happen in a fast pace it always happen really slow.

All of a sudden plants will start to die really fast, people will have areally hard time breathing and will probably have to go to the hospital because of the lack of oxygen they can get.

Imagine saving you money, wouldent that be nice not having to worry about a car paymeny or gas?

alot of people would have so much money that alot of them nedd because there is alot of families struggling to make it by the have to constantly worry if they have enough money to pay the bills and put gass in there vehicle to get to work to make the money to survie.

what if instead of having a vehicle and constantly spending money on gas you walked or took a bike to work, imagine all that money you saved by donig something little as that.",0
"Getting rid of the electoral college would be illogical and irrational. The electoral college was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers to compromise between the Congress and the people. It is seen as nondemocratic to the modern day system because the electors elect the president, not the people because when you vote for a presidential election you are actually voting for a slate of electors. Many people say that ""what if they go against your wishes"" but the truth is that it rarely happens. So there is no reason to wory. We must retain the Electoral College despite it being ""nondemocratic"" because we will be certain of our outcome, avoid runoff elections, and Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have.

""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" in paragraph 18 meaning that winning the candidates share of electoral votes over powers his share of popular votes. ""In 2012's election, for example, Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and rodney."" in paragraph 18 shows how almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis. So even if there was a slight popularity it creates a land slide in that state.

Having an Electoral College avoids the problem of having an election where no candidate receives the majority of votes. For example in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both only had 43% plurality of popular votes. Which meant they were tied and meant of a run on election. However, having the Electoral College produces a clear winner. In paragraph 23 it says ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California.""paragraph 23 Meaning that they might not even vote if it's not going to count for anything.

Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have by population. For example in the 2012 election the popular vote was very close in Florida and Obama got the vote with 29 electoral votes. ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" because they mean more. paragraph 21 Many say that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnter take all system in each state. However, why would you soend time in a state that you know they have no chance of winning. It would be a waste of time and money. That is why they focus on the swing states.

The Electoral College method of selecting the president could cause potential voters not to vote anymore because they don't see why they would if it doesnt count for anything. However no voter's vote swings a national election. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think what a single vote may decide on an election.""paragaph 23 This just shows how we should let the electoral college decide who will be running our country, not the people.",0
"The anachronism that is the electoral college is a system that unfairly represents voters and can possibly lead to catastrophe. The much simpler solution would be election by popular vote where every voter in every state matters rather than the system of the electoral college that discounts many voters opinions. The arguments against popular vote are either illogical or inconsequential and we as a nation should pay no heed.

The biggest and most obvious problem with our current electoral college system is that it unfairly represents voters in the states. An example of this unfairness towards voters propagated by the system is expressed in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner where it is stated that in the 2012 election between rodney and Obama Florida gave all of its electoral votes towards Obama when he only won 61.7 percent of the vote. This method completely exludes the opinion of the minority, that 48.3 percent of people in Florida who didn't vote for Obama got their say taken away, their opinion no longer mattered to the election because all of the electors were given to Obama by a small majority. A second unfairness to the voters is the attention taken away from any voter not in a swing state. In the article written by Bradford Plumer named ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" it is said that in the 2000 election that seventeen states got no attention from the candidates whatsoever. This system gives undeserved attention to a few swing states which will decide the election because of our outdated system of the electoral college. If popular vote was instituted the attention given to voters of all states would be equal as every vote from every state matters.

A problem with the electoral college that could possibly outshine the unfairness of it would be the potential for catastrophe that it brings. As is stated in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer the electors presented by the states according to popular vote are not even obliged to vote for the candidate they said they would. Even though this may be a rare occurace a single elector betraying his party could cause misrepresentation of millions of Americans. Another possible disaster would be a tie vote in the electoral college. This situation, as explained in the same article, would cause a vastly unfair election incomparable even to the unfairness of the normal system. This horrible system consists of each state getting one vote for the president which when you consider that some states have many times the population of others means that millions upon millions of people could have the same say a a couple hundred thousands, an injustice unthinkable in our society and one that could be stopped by instituting a popular vote system.

The arguments against popular vote presented in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner are unrealistic, unsupported, or insignificant. The argument presented as ""Certainty of Outcome"" says that a dispute over popular vote would be much more common but provides no evidence to support the claim, invalidating it. The article's second argument states that candidates would have more incentive to stay in their region if popular vote were implemented but this entire argument relies on the fact that there are not enough electors in any one region in order to elect a president. Although this is true it doesn't matter because the same is true of population, no one region has an overwhelming population advantage over others and population is what matters in popular vote. The third argument is the most illogical stating that the electoral college's tendency of causing only swing states to matter is actually a good thing because it increases the education of the populations of those states by the increased attention by the candidate, therefore the educated would decide the vote, making it more accurate. This is a parochial and shortsighted viewpoint, not considering the fact that the system of popular vote would make candidates pay attention to all populations, making all voters more educated rather than having some elite educated aristocracy in the swing states. The articles fourth argument is possibly even more deluded than the third, stating that large states get more attention because of the electoral college which balances out the fact that states have hugely varying populations but the exact same thing would happen in popular vote because some states have larger populations and candidates need larger populations for election in popular vote. The electoral college in this instance changes nothing meaning that the argument leads nowhere. The only argument presented in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner that has any merit is the fifth which shows that popular vote could lead to possibly complicated runoff elections. Although that is a disadvantage of popular vote I believe that the vast unfairness and averting disaster is worth the cost of slightly complex runoff elections.

To support the electoral college one must rely on unrealistic or insignificant evidence. This ""evidence"" can be easily refuted and outwieghed by strong evidence from the opposing side. To support the electoral college you are supporting unfairness and catastrophe and to any reasonable person that is not a very intelligent idea, making the need for popular vote irrefutable.",0
"The United States has been known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but that's not all. It's also known for the different freedoms made available and its fair government. The electoral college is a system in which states choose representatives to vote on the president. In the past, there was a big debate on whether or not this process was fair. The electoral college is not fair or trustworthy for many reasons.

Imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. Sadly, they ended up changing their mind. You could end up with a president you don't like or believe in. Voters don't have total control over who their electors vote for. To me, that doesn't sound very fair. If everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. Based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. That means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. Our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it's our right to a fair vote.

There are more problems than just an unfair vote. It almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. In the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have separated the victor from the loser. What would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? Who would become president? I'm sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but I don't believe it could. Since there are less people making the decision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. If one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. Also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. The people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their decision, so they deserve recognition too.

The electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. Americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. Also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. America is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. So, let's give Americans the chance for a fair vote.",0
"Have you ever wondered what will happen if we keep using cars as a means of transportation? All the air pollution, killing the atmosphere, wasting valuable resources. The future is going to be a place where we can't even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communities, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communities, and more beneficial ways of transportation. Once you go green you will go never back.

To start off, Smog is one of the main disadvantages of owning or being in heavily populated area where they use cars frequently. Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get trapped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certain days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.

In addition, cities around the world are creating new communities where they are not allowed to use cars. In Vauban, Germany the residents there are in a set up where they cannot use cars in there everyday life. 70 percent of the people over there do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move into the community. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life. The life were they are no cars is a good life for a community and for everyone else.

Lastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bikesharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life. Sutdies have shown that are less likely to get their drivers liscense and get a car. The world will be in a better place without car usage.

To summerize, limiting car usage is a extrodinary idea to make the world a better place. To cease the air pollution of smog, to make greener communities, and to make efficent ways of transportation.",0
"""All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Mr. Goldberg an official of transportation for America, a growing coalition to promote car frees communities said. The world is changing for the better and one of the machines man created, that is one of the world changing inventions of it's time is coming down for it's throne is the car. So what are the reasons for not getting a car? lets find out.

In Germany, that is coming faster than people think. An idea called ""Smart planning is taking hold in an experimental town built in 2006 named Vauban. A place were cars are a thing of the past. People everyday are not driving to school or work they are walking, bicycling, or taking the tram into the town from the suburb. Smart planning is revolutionary building towns to not be dependent on driving. 70% of vaughn's families do not own car and are much happier to not have the everyday anxiety of driving a motor engine car everyday. 57% sold there car just to move into the small town of Vauban. Car free suburbs and town are a growing trend all across Europe, the united states and many more nations. These efforts have been making cities, towns, and suburbs denser so you don't have to go far to get some milk and eggs.

The global warning is a huge part of the fight to make the earth our home more better and healthier for generations and generations to come. Cars emit gas emissions that make up 12% of the greenhouse gases in our environment, up to 50% percent in carintensive areas in the United States and around the world.

France, Paris having heavy smog decided to have a partial ban on driving making even numbered license plates not drive or fear a fine. Congestion went down after the experiment. What was to blame for the smog was the Diesel fuel being used in most cars because of the fact that a tax policy favors diesel fuel over gasoline. Paris having more smog than the typical capital had a decrease in congestion and the citiy after enormous victory decided to go at it again and do odd numbered license cars.

The car culture is one the has had enormous effect on the everyday lives citizens around the world. In the United states, ""Recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" In America where the car culture has turned us into the number one place in the world to find the history of one of the planets world changing innventions. People want a greener earth and benifits of not owning a car because everybody knows the stress of having a car no matter ho much it helps you. The car in which you have to have insurance, life insurance, car payments, you have to keep up with your car, the dangers associated with having a car and stress plus anxiety that comes with a car. The cons outweight the pros but those pros have an enormous effect. People are changing and the percentile of teenagers and young adults have droped ten fold in getting or renewing a license. The new trend is that people are no longer getting cars or licenses so why should you.

The people of planet earth understand the pros or cons of a car the benifits of not diving and are making for that change. One of the worlds greatest innventions is stepping off there throne.",0
"In order to dramatically reduce greenhouse gases, a new fad is being introduced all over the world. The fad is ways to make the world more ""carfree"" or ""carreduced"". This may sound shocking and to complicated to implement, but believe it or not, there are communities and cities that are already showing improvement with decreasing greenhouse gases that cars let off.

Vauban, Germany, is an upscale, fully functional experimental German suburb on the outskirts of Freiburg, without cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are not found in Vauban, the main form of transportation is a public tram that runs to downtown Freiburg. Heidrun Walter is a media trainer who lives in Vauban with her two kids, Mrs. Walter states, "" I am much happier this way"". Completed in 2006, Vauban is a an example of a growing European and United States trend that separates auto usage from suburban life. Everything that the 5,500 residents of Vauban could need is walking distance away, the community is built in a rectangular square mile with all of the stores on a main street.

Greenhouse gases from Europe contribute to 12 percent of all emissions, the United States is responsible for as much as 50 percent of these emissions. To most people, these numbers would be meaningless, but to the people of Paris, these number clearly showed with their smog covered streets. Paris hit a nearrecord pollution rate which caused the partial driving ban to take place. The partical driving ban in Paris was as follows on Monday, motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to not use their cars, or be forced to pay a fine, on Tuesday, the same instructions were put in place for oddnumbered plates, this ban continued throughout the week. While this did outrage some drivers, public transit was free of charge from Monday through Friday which did help drivers who were restricted.

A national ""Day without cars"" was Bogota, Columbia's way to incorperate car limitations. Millions of Columbian participants found alternative ways to get to and from work. Bogota has a total of 7 million citizens who were promoted to use alternative transportation and reduce smog. Despite gray clouds and random spurts of rain, Mayor or Bogota, Antanas Mockus said, "" The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" For a first time, during the previous national, ""Day without cars"" two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Rera, the mayor of Asuncin, Paraguay. Along with the ""Day without cars,"" Columbia has also put out rushhour restrictions, smoothed sidewalks, and cropped new resturants and upscale shopping districts.

All three cities have showed creative and functional ways to cut back on using cars, weather it be offering new ways to have a less complicated life in Vauban, Germany, limiting the number of cars that can drive on certain day in Paris, France, or creating a national holiday which encourages people to find alternative ways of transportation like in Bogoata, Columbia. It is clear that people in places everywhere are ready to make a change to cut down on greenhouse gases. The United States, as a whole has shown cutbacks on the number of vehicles and licenses being issued, in fact the amount of young people driving decreased by 23 percent from 2001 and 2009. Ultimately, the goal for the entire world is to conserve resources, lower emission rates of harmful greenhouse gases and improve safety, with the rate that cities and communities are going now, this goal without a doubt reachable.",0
"There are several advantages when you limit car usage. One, you will reduce greenhouse gases. Two, you will lower the stress level of people when they thinking about driving. Three, young people will decrease their amount of driving. Overall, limiting car usage can help fellow citizens.

Limiting car usage wil reduce greenhouse gases. In Source 1 the passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. While we limit car usage you will not only help reduce greenhouse gases,but you will help reduce air pollution. When theres no air pollution there will be a clean atmosphere. Furthermore, limiting car usage can benefit the environment.

Limiting car usage will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Everyday people have to plan before they drive. Sometimes when people plan for driving they get stressed thinking about if theirs traffic or what if the road is closed. In Source 3 the passage states that rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Furthermore, limiting car usage will limit the stress level of people thinking about driving.

Limiting car usage will decrease young people's amount of driving. In Source 4 the passage states that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license. Another study in Source 4 was found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If their's less young people driving then there will be less accidents occurring. Overall, limiting car usage will keep young drivers from injuring themselves.

Either way limiting car usage will help our fellow citizens in general. This will reduce greenhouse gases. This will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Also, limiting car usage will decrease the amount of young people driving. furthermore limiting car usage will help us citizens.",0
"Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the politicians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an end to the use of cars on a daily bases. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its' streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this ""carfree"" city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an anticar revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticeably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever growing ""carfree"" city club by starting a program that sponsors a carfree day once a year.

Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completely inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundance of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emersed into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its' residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the contructions of highways and such. When reading the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation.

Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnessasary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 14. While Paris officials wanted to completely eradicate driving completely so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completely banned all at once. To help illiminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its' citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether or not it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty two euro fine. According to the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illiminated in Paris after that week.

After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogota, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completely banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article ""CarFree Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selskey in paragragh 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they're reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogota in the mid1990s according to the article titled ""CarFree Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in paragrapgh 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogota have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicyce paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city.

Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article ""The End Of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable and seem to take more time then to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used and is needed than most people in America seem to take to carpooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to decrease the amount of air pollution in the country.",0
"Many people are in belief of evaporating the idea of having the Electoral college. A Gallop poll taken in 2000 shows that citizens would rather have a direct election. As a member of the United States you must think of all the possibilities. Yes, the electoral college was once a great process, but now there are some changes are in need of being made.

The electoral college is a process in which we select electors. This long and dragged out procedure is many steps that take months to prepare for. First, there must be a selection of the electors which are chosen by the states. Then the meeting must be planned and taken place. Who and why is a hard aspect to decide on voting day for those who have been chosen to be the electors. Votes for president and Vice President must be made. After voting the counting beings. The Electoral College has a total of 538 members. Over 270 votes must be made to elect the President. This process can easily be shortened by using a direct election.

By having a direct election everyone's voice is heard. This means less arguing in the states. Citizens enjoying believing their thoughts are not being avoided. Having the Electoral College taking place is highly unwanted in the US. This is because the people believe a direct vote is more efficient way for them to show who they believe is worthy of being President and Vice President.

Each candidate running for office retains a group of electors from a state. These electors are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. This means if a person doesn like the electors chosen they feel like they still dont have a say of what is going on in the presidential election.

In conclusion, The Electoral College is no longer a process citizens enjoy. This procedure is too long and citizens dont encourage it. Many people believe that this branch of government feels they will lose more power if the Electoral College is given up on. Using a direct election will spare the arguments and will allow us to have an easy and manageable process in which to vote on our leading man.",0
"Since remotely times, the manhad look for some way to make his life easier, since primitive hunting weapons, to carriages. The carriages were pulled by horses mostly, and on those times, the most that those animals could do for contamination was pooping but the owners had people to clean for it as well assomeone who took care of it. While the times had change, the transportation media has too as well with the cars which it actually result to be a doble sided bladecontaminating with smog.

In Paris the government has banned driving due to smog, the smog has caused a huge impact on this city, giving to it cooler nights and warmer days, many habitats blame Diesel fuel, but it does not matter which fuel you would use, it would burn and produce smog anyways. On the other hand,Vauban, Germany, is offering a new life style that many people has decided to adopt the suburbian community has no cars at the streets, people there does not own a carbecause they do not need it, the public transportation works very well, so it is not a primary need. They can live perfectlywithout cars, then they are not that necessary. Many people even sell their cars in order to move to Vauban, and had said that their lifes are so much less stressful than when they did own a car. Mothers can let their childrens to play in the streets without thinking that a car is going to kill them, and kids can let go technology if their moms want them to play outside most of the kids are so attached to technology because it is a way that parents have to keep them away from the streets. Maybe these changes like in Germany were too radicals, but it can start by a day a year like in Bogot, Colombia where once a year people take a carfree day, being buses and taxis the only ones allowed to produce smog, the violators are charged with 25 dollars fines. Even in the U.S., from 2003 to 2009 young people driving decreased a 23%, young people are considered the most dangerous driving people. There is so much for young people to do that they are not focused on driving, this could be the beginning of a new era, in April 2013 the number of miles per person was equal that in 1995 where the cars where less than right now. There it is even a program in New York promoting carpooling!

But for example, here in Florida the public transportation is not that good, you actually need a car that drives you to the bus station and then take the bus a bus that will let you on a train station, that train station will offer you a ride of an hour to another bus that takes about half an hour to get to your job if you live in Homestead and work in Miami. That is about three hours just arriving to your job, every day for five days in a row that is about thirty hours a week, just to get to your job! But if you have a car, those three hours now are one hour, which seems reasonable and it is still a lot!. If someone lives at Homestead and needs to do something which is generally at downtown Miami or Doral you would have to dedicate a whole day just doing it, if you are going in car because the distance between cities are ridiculous, can you imagine if not having it? For doing something you would have to take two days and do it by parts or wake up at the very morning when it is still dark so you can complete everything by the afternoon. So defenetly the car is a primary need.

Analyzing the life style that people at Vauban have, they are less stressed thanthe average personwhoowns a carpeople starts to be more social with their neighbors because they have to walk everywhere and the faces are the same, so they actually get to know each other. They also got the benefit of a cleaner enviroment because they do not have the daily doses of smog that someone living in a city would have cars cause the 12% of the contamination in Europe and more than a 50% in the United States. That is a problem that Paris maybe would not be facing right now if they had payed attention to contamination levels.Since World War II, science has been centered on developing new and better cars can you imagine what would we have right now if some other would center the science in medicicne or something else?. In the United States an 80% of the budget goes to highways while just a 20% goes to public transportation. But, how can people in Bogot or Vauben survive without cars? The distance between the comercial and suburban areas are close enough so a bus could take you there just one bus. Defenetly, making the change would be hard due to our attachment to our cars, but little by little we can change or life style.",0
"Dear fellow citizens of America it has come to my attention that pollution in the United States is getting worse so I have a solution use cars less. It is simple, this will help cut pollution in the U.S as the second biggest polluting factor is gone and can actually help you with a better social life as well as helping rebuild the community.

As mentioned earlier,cars are the second leading cause of pollution in the U.S and cutting that will help stop some pollution by stopping one of the biggest causes. Stopping the use of cars will cut the carbon in the air and this in turn can lead to a healthier lifestyle as well. There are many neighborhoods that are carless and we have received good results from said neighborhoods as well as car free day is becoming a hit in Columbia as well as other parts in central America. This will also make smog a less likely occurrence as no car fumes are getting trapped therefore, cleaner, unpolluted air. This will help prevent the same pollution levels like in Paris pop up here.

A life without cars can also positively affect the social lives of many people. As people are more likely to just walk and talk with friends or just walk or bike to the park. people in carless community like Vauban have even said they feel less stress now that they don't have cars. Young Americans have even started losing interests in cars and would rather take public transport or carpool with friends then just take their own car. And as a result are tighter with their friends and family then before.

People who use cars for transport are less likely to use the sidewalk or ride their bike and as a result sidewalks and bike paths are uneven and ragged. Therefore without cars, things like disrepair sidewalks or roads would come to our attention. For example Car Free Day in Columbia led to the repair of sidewalks and 118 miles of bike roads and more sport centers parks and shopping districts have started to pop up. Getting rid of cars can help us rebuild the community with more parks and public centers and hangouts. This will also lead to better security as less people will get hit by cars, less car accidents and overall better security.

In conclusion my fellow citizens, please consider makeing this community carless. for their are many advantages for doing so in this community from the enviromental, to the social and to the health benefits.",0
"Reducing the usage of cars in today's world could be extremely beneficial. Sure, it is also a hastle having to reroute your commute and also making the time to get there, but the myriad advantages to the reduction of car usage is astonishing. Reducing our usage of cars will reduce the smog in cities, such as Los Angeles, Beijing, and Paris, reduce the stress of many drivers, and also save people money. Now who doesn't love money?

Smogpollution is growing daily in dense, polluted areas. Looking outside of LA, you can see the dirty, polluted air surrounding the city, as well as the toxic blanket the covers Beijing. One of the main sources contributing to this is cars. Greenhouse gases are emitted from tailpipe and go straight into the atmosphere. In Europe, exhaust makes up fifteen percent of greenhouse gas emission, and accounts for fifty percent in the United States, FIFTY PERCENT. That's half of the pollution in our country, and an easy solution is to limit car usage. If your car usage is not limitable, perhaps switching to a hybrid car such as a Toyota Prius will make you feel good about contributing to the cause. Some areas, like Bogota, Colombia, participate in a Carfree Day. This day is widely celebrated in the area and is infectious spreading to nearby areas and potentially the world soon enough. This day allows for smog reduction. Cities such as Paris, however, have to ban car usage sometimes because their smog is so bad. During this ban, hybrid cars and carpooling is allowed. This shows the extreme measures necessary to reduce the smog in populated areas.

As most people know, driving is stressful and is perhaps a top contributor of stress in America. In populated areas, rushhour traffic is annoying and causes many people to change their schedules. When driving during rushhour, you are in constant fear of potentially being cutoff and your risk of being in an accident heightens dramtically. With that being said, what if I told you there was a way to completely cut out this fear? Communities such as Vauban, Germany are helping alleviate stress by making carfree communities. Within these communities, cars are allowed to be owned, but you must park it in a parking garage at the end of the community and also buy a spot... for 40,000. Cars are used rarely, as restaurants, shops, and others are within walking distance of these communities. Cars are only used for longdistance travel and are permitted on highways and on the outer edges of the area. The stress is alleviated because you can walk outside, grab your mail, and listen to the birds if want, all without the worry of cars. You don't need to constant check your rearview mirrors if you're walking to your favorite restaurant. With the introduction of smartphones and the constantly growing usage rate of the internet, people don't need cars to communicate anymore. They can simply go on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. to communicate.

Finally, the reduction of car usage allows for people to save money, and a significant amount too. If you live in a neighborhood such as Vauban, there may be no need for a car at all. In today's world, a good car costs somewhere are 3040 thousand dollars. Imagine what you could do with that much money. You could get a nice house, or travel to your favorite destination, or anything really. You could send your kid to a nice college! And the drawbacks are small, because everything is within a twenty minute walk. That sounds pretty nice to me.",0
"To be fair,both the electoral college and a aoaular vote are good ways to decide an election. Although,a aoaular vote may have more aitfalls than the latter. The electoral college is definitely the best way to aick a candidate without much confusion. The electoral college may have some down falls too but the benefits out weigh them.

A aoaular vote also has some benefits. In Richard A. aoster's aassage In Defence of the Electoral College he states,""The electoral college is not a democratic method it is the electors who elect the aresident not the aeoale""source 3 a15. If this was our voting method the aeoale would be choosing the aresident, not the electors. Plus the aeoale dont even know the electors their voting for. In the aassage The Indefensible Electoral College author Bradford Plumer states,""The state aicks the electors and the voters dont even get to aick who the electors vote for"" source 2 a 10. Basically the aeoale have no control over who they elect.

Indeed there maybe limited control for the aeoale over voting for their candidatebut the electors usually aick whoever the aeoale voted for. The electoral college also is a easier way to decide who wins the election. Theres almost no way there can be a tie in an electoral vote. Richard A.Posner states,""The winning candidates share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the aoalular vote"".""Even if the aoaular vote winner wins by a little he wins all the electoral votes""source 3 a 15.Which means there is no confusion as to who wins.

Not only is the electoral college more organized but it makes the aresident have to aaaeal to many regions of aeoale. Richard A. Posner states,""Not one region has enough votes to win an election so the aresident has to be liked by other regions as well""source 3 a 19.This means that at least half the country must like the candidate for him to win. Swing states are also imaortant in the electoral college. These states are the ones that really care and study who will be the best aresident. Another statement from Richard A.Posner states,""Peoale in swing states decide the election and are the most thoughtful voters""source 3 a 20.So the candidate must be trying to make sure they alease the aeoale.

The aeoale may like a aoaular vote the best,but the most organized and beneficial way to elect candidates is through electoral college. The electoral college not helas with organizing it helas aeoale know the candidate. They know the candidate because the candidate must go to each region and get to know the aeoale.",0
"Dear Rick Scott, Controversial. This is the word that can describe the Electoral College in recent elections. The Electoral College is composed of 538 votes, a presidential candidate must acquire 270 to win the election. States with large populations get more electoral votes so say, Rhode Island. California gets 55 votes while the puny Rhode Island gets a whopping 3 votes. The Electoral College has been debated since the 2000 election, where Al Gore lost even though he got more popularity votes. Many folks believe the Electoral College should be abolished. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in the presidential elections, because it shows a clear winner, it ensures it is, ""Everyone's President"", educated voters count in the swing states and it avoids RunOff Elections.

Without the Electoral College, some elections may be hard to decide a true winner. No matter the situation, the Electoral College will determine a winner, if the popular vote and electoral vote become tied, which is highly unlikely, the vote will be taken to the senate. Each senator counts as one vote, so no longer do bi states matter. Also, the Electoral College ensures the presidential candidates have transregional appeal. It makes the votes count, the president chose is surely, ""Everyone's President,"" rather than a favorite in just northeastern states. Furthermore, swing states are tremendously important to the outcome of the election. States such as Florida, New York, Texas and California have dozens of votes combined, winning all four of those states pretty much means presidency. The swing states not only have more electoral votes because of population, but because of their voters. On average, there are more educated voters in the swing states, they actually stay up to date, watch the news and know the means of each candidate. The Electoral College also avoids the disaster of which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. A good example of this is when Clinton had only 43% of the popular votes won, yet he got a whopping 370 electoral votes, which made him president. The pressure of having a runoff election is nearly vanished by the Electoral College. Although others say that the Electoral College should be abolished, because in that system, voters vote a slate of electors, not the president. Well tough , the Electoral College ensures a winner, and that is all that matters.

The Electoral College should, for sure, be kept in the Presidential Election system. It consists of 538 total votes, and 270 votes have to go to a candidate to pick a winner. Although the votes may tie up, which is nearly impossible, the Electoral College ensures another method to decide the presidency. The Electoral College produces a sure winner, ""Everyone's President,"" is elected, educated voters are in the swing states and it avoids the disaster of a RunOff Election.",0
"Many people throughout the world, would agree that car usage plays a significant role in daily lives. Although some may argue it plays an important role or a not so important role, the limitation of car usage would be a very helpful thing for everyone, and the world we are surrounded by. There are many advantages to cities being able to control the amount of cars being used everyday. Advantages such as, less pollution in the environment by creating less smog, making the cities and roads a lot safer, by lowering the risk of getting into or even causing a wreck, or even something as simple as making your life, and the lives around you much more peaceful.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. paragraph 5"" Cars are the number one cause of pollution in most cities, especially ones that have large amounts of drivers on the road in a single day. The author of source one, states in paragraph 8 that ""..some new suburbs may well look more Vaubanlike not only in developed countries, but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities"" All authors state that limiting car usage, is a great way to reduce air pollution. Paragraph 10, of source two, states that ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" If car usage was limited in cities there would be less smog, and pollution in the air. Not only would it be better for the environment, it would also be better for your health.

Wrecks are things that claim the lives of people each and everyday. Some can be prevented, yet not all can. Think of how many lives are taken each day, due to wrecks because of things like congestion in big cities. Or even things such as someone behind the wheel who is stressed, and driving recklessly. A source from paragraph 3, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Many people, get tense and stressed from the drivers around them. Limiting how much you use a car, can improve things such as stress levels. Imagine how much more at ease you would be if you constantly heard, a bicylest wizzing by you, or hearing children chattering and laughing among themselves, instead of hearing horns honking, loud motors, or even the sound of a car crash.

Roads and streets take up much more space than we think or even realize. With less cars on the road everyday and more people walking, or riding a bike, could only mean one thing less roads and bigger sidewalks. More cities are trying to make limiting car usage a much bigger thing, ""...in attempts to make suburbs more compact..."" Source one, also states that ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather that in malls along some distant highway. paragraph 6"" Getting to these places will become safer for everyone.

As you can see, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, such as, limiting the amount of pollution there is, lowering the risks of getting into, or even causing a wreck, and even something as simple as making it a more peaceful environment to live in, not only for yourself, but for others around you. Our world, and daily lives would be affected in great ways, in more cities, and even more countries, participated in lessing the amount of car usage.",0
"Are we using cars too much?

In Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog , "" After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because that we use cars too much, we are creating pollution that is basically driving the planet we live on downhill. There is a way to change this. Limiting car usage, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

Life can go on without cars. In VAUBAN,Germany a community has created a carfree city. The streets are completely car free. This is an experimental new district that is seeing if excluding cars can life become better not only physically but also mentally. Many people driving on the roads daily tend to have more stress from overcrowding streets, noise, and most of all crashes. ""As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move to here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said heidrun Walter."" Source 1,3 From this evidence it shows that life without a car can actually have a better impact on a person.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is it reduces pollution. Paris enforced a driving ban to clear smog from the global city after a near record pollution. From this ban almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and some even had their cars impounded due to their reactions from the fines. But these fines and bans came out with a positive effect in the end. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after a few days of putting the ban into effect. The smog cleared enough for the French ruling party to rescind the ban for certain days.

Has America's love for cars already started cooling? Or has technology taken the reason why we should drive away? Elisabeth Rosenthal states that , "" the interent makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. the renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" source 4, 35 I believe that since technology has evolved that people dont feel the need to leave home to meet friends when they can just use apps or call,text,facetime,etc.

These reasons I showed make me believe that limitng car usage can create positive advantages, I hope they make you feel the same way too.",0
"They come in red, blue, green, black, and white. They beep and honk while they ride on highways and transport people form place to place. Cars are everclear. What would the world be like if we didnt have cars? What are the benefits of life without cars? Life with out cars benefits the environment, and peoples' health.

First of all, the elimination of cars helps the environment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" 5. In other words, cars are highly responsible for the harmful gases that pollute our atmosphere and cause global warming. In Paris, a partial driving ban was issued to clear the air after days of high air pollution rates. After the driving ban, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after fivedays of intensifying smog"" 14. By using cars less, citizens can reduce pollution and help keep our earth clean and safe. statistics show that fewer people are using cars around the world. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" 41. Sociologists believe that this trend will continue and possibly increase. They believe it will ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" 34.

Another benefit to limiting car usage is that it will benefit the health of citizens both mentally and physically. In the German suburb of Vauban, citizens have given up their cars. A resident there says ""when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" 3. Limiting car use also limits the frequency of traffic jams, accidents, and unfriendly drivers in a hurry along with the stress and frustration that accompany them. In colombians capital, bogota, the Day Without Cars has had many participants. One of whom said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"" referring to the event. 24 limiting stress can have major benefits to a persons health and mental wellbeing. limiting the use of cars does'nt just positively effect mental health, it can positively influence physical health. In bogota, Colombia, the carfree day inspired residents to ""hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work "" 20. Excersize releases endorphins which are chemicals in the brain related to pleasure. Many people that excersize regularly are happier then when they don't. By limiting car usage,citizens are more inspired to excersize making them happier and healthier.

In sumation, a life without cars means a healthy, longlasting planet along with a happy, relaxed, and healthy population. Even though cars are conveint, they have many negative side effects. Next time you want to go for a ride, think of all the benefits of limiting them. Rember what a breath of fresh air feels like because the gasses from cars might mean they will be gone soon. Get used to angry faces honking horns, and being given ""the bird"" by angry drivers because with cars come many conveiniences, but also many frustations.",0
"Why are the streets always so jammed!? Everyone asks that all the time almost everyday around 5:00pm. The reason for is because cars being excessively used nowadays. There are several different advantages that can happen when limiting car usage. The world would be a better place if less cars were used on the roads.

To begin with, why do we the people use cars? The reason is because it can get us from A to B really fast. But that's only 1 positive for the usage of cars. Think about the negatives and disadvantages of using cars. My 1 main reason of the usage of cars is that it make the world less active. Walking or running is a daily form of exercise, and the usage of cars is limiting the numbers of that. In section 1 redrum Walter says that he always was tense when he had a car, he's much happier without one. This is why we should limit the usage of cars. We don't want the people to be tense all the time, we want them to enjoy and relax when using transportation other than cars. Walking will take longer but is better in the long run. You don't have traffic jams, you can go places and areas that cars couldn't fit through and you have many different ways of getting to a particular place rather than just a road. The only repercussion that you have to worry about with walking is the rain. But heres the thing, In section 3 Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" This means rain isn't a problem when walking on the streets. Cars may offer more protection but its more dangerous than walking. This is why places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota are trying to carry out the experience of a ""carfree"" life.

In addition, another advantage of limiting car use is limiting riots. I know we have all heard of people screaming and arguing in the cars of people in front or behind them. This is a big problem nowadays and it's because of the use of cars. If we can limit the usage of cars than we can hopefully reduce the level of aggrevation on the streets. Alot of accidents happen everyday dealing with the usage of cars. Cars provoke alot of deaths if you think about it. If we could limit the usage of driving cars than this will limit the amount of deaths per year by cars. That's the number 1 disadvantages to the using of cars. Walking and biking are my 2 favorite types of transportation because it's smooth, and it's more conveinant. Less accidents and injurys happen when walking or riding a bike. This can also help the streets be less packed which will allow for easier access to certain places. DUI is the main worst tragic that comes from the usage of cars. Many people die everyday because of drunk drivers and thats not respectable. Just imagine if the same person who caused an accident in the car while drunk was drunk on the streets while walking, he more than likely couldn't of caused an accident if he was walking and not driving a car. Just think about all of the disadvantages that cars promote.

Last but not least, comes the president Barack Obamas most valuable reason to limit car usage. Obama wants to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions, and by that he wants to get fewer cars on the road. In section 4 it shows that ""studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This means that Obama's goal is prevailing. Paris came to a conclusion that they decided to ban driving due to smog. In section 2 it states that Paris air became so polluted that they enforced a parial ""driving ban"" to get rid of the air pollution. They blamed this problem due to the diesel fuel. They figured out that diesels make up 67% of vehicles in France, as to 53% in the rest of Western Eurpoe. In section 2 its pretty much the same reason except Bogota's goal is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The violators faced 25 fines."" They figured limiting car usage was a good opportunity to take away stress and reduce air pollution. In section 4 the last paragraph tells you what Bill Ford plan was. He wanted to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, onserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" These are some advantages of less car usage. Many good things will start to happen if everyone could lower the usage of cars nowadays. We don't want the world to have polluted air, we don't want to promote car accidents, and we also don't want under age drivers on the streets. So take in mind the disadvantages of usage of cars and compared the to the the advantages of limiting car usage.",0
"For a long time now we have been fighting against global warming and polution. Some people why we cant just end the fight quickly. And the reason is simply because we still rely so much on cars. All people need to find so type of way to stop using cars as much. There are some places that are already starting to limit uses. Like in Vauban, Germany who has a ban on cars, Paris, France who can use certain cars on certain days, and bogota, Colombia.

One way people could limit their use of cars is if they did something like what Vauban, Germany did. Build cities that had no drive ways and no parking lots. That way people had to buy parking garage spots that cost alot of money. According to source one passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe. Many will think this is not alot but think about how much polution there is, then find out how twelve percent is it will be alot. But when these types of cities are made there will be a reduce in the emissions because little if any cars we be driven here. In source one Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This showes that without cars in people life it removes a tremondus amount of stress. People dont have to worry about spending money on gas or they don't have to worry about paying large amounts of money for their car to be fit. When there is not so much money at stake you tent to be a little less tense. Obvously creating a city were you have to buy a parking garage spot to hold your car would be a great idea because it would reduce the amount of polution being released and it would make the people living in the city less stressed.

Another ways people could limit the use of cars is if they do something like Paris, France does. They placed a ban on cars with odd numbered licens plates on Mondays, And placed a ban on cars with even numbered licens plates on Tuesdays. They did this because they were having record breaking amounts of polution being released. They were releasing more polution than Beijing, China who is the leading city in polution. But according to article two Paris found a sixty percent decrease in polution in just five days of this even odd ban. This means they lost more than half of the cities polution by limiting the cars on Monday to only even licens and limiting the cars to only odd licens on Tuesday. Cleary this is a very effective method of reducing the amount of cars being used.

A third way cars could be used less is if you have no car days like bogota, Colombia has. In article three Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air polution."" He is saying that cars a cause for polution and doing this day is a good way of lowering polution rates. This source also stated that other cities in Columbia like Cali and Valledpar are joining in this event. It is also said that other country leaders go to Colombia to watch this event. Afterwards they say the event is awesome. This means that not only is the event spreading across Colombia, but it could possibly spread to other countries as well. Without a doubt this is another effective way to limit the use of cars.

It is clear that cars are a problem. But many people use them anyway, but what they don't think about is how much they are contributing to polution. Some ways to limit car usage are create cities where you have to pay for a place to store you car, have and even odd licens day, and have no car days.",0
"America is the country of the people, the people are the ones in the country, and are the ones living in the country. The method of which the leader of this country are selected by the people is by popular vote. Therefore, the best way, the right way of selecting the president and vice president are by popular vote.

Starting of with that the electoral college is unfair. The electors might know more about this country and they think they know what is the best for these United states but they do not. The peoplr know best, the people knows what is actually going on. Just as Bradford Plummer stated in his article""the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality""source 14. All these elector are in the political world, so they know everything political about the country and the best leader politically. These elector dont know about all the small things that thousands of people are suffering from.

People want to have say in their country. If the method of choosing the president was strictly by popular college the people would feel as if the country is not theirs and if they are being controlled. The people who live in the country need to agree because if not then kaos would start to happen. People would protest and this country would fall apart bit by bit. Richard A. Posner said ""to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interest, that he really isn't their president""source 19. If this is how the people feel when the other president running wins instead of the one they selected won, you could just imagine how they would feel if they did not have a part choosing who is going to be the next president of the United States.

The electoral college is just not fair. Richard A. Posner says that on of the reason to retain the electoral college is ""its lack of democratic pedigree""source 17. If this country has been running smoothly with popular vote why would someone want to change it? Well manyy times change is good because it is improving becoming better at something although something like this should not change.

So just to restate that eliminating the popular vote would be unfair, unright, and just plain wrong. Just like in the preamble ""we the people"".",0
"There are a lot of things that develop and hold a Electoral College together. There are also a lot of down falls to the Electoral College. Every state has 1 House of Representative plus 2 of your Senators in the Electoral College. There are a total of 538 people but 270 of them is the majority vote that wins. There are a total of 5 reasons why we have to keep this method to choosing the president. The 5 ways are Certainty of outcome,Everyone's President,Swing States,Big States and Avoid RunOff Elections.

The main reason we have a Electoral College is so they have a right way to choose a president. The main reason for this is so that we dont leave our electing in the hands of foreign peopleimmiagrants. The is what the president needs to get elected in the electoral college. There are still a lot of down falls to this method of the electoral college though. One of these issues is ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voter"". This means ""winner takes all"" which is they only focus on the bigger states and not the smaller ones because the bigger states have bigger population which means they have more in the electoral college. Another issue with this method is that the person thats running for president might get the popularity vote but still not win. See everyone that votes isnt really voting directly for the president, the people who really count is the electoral college. In order to win the vote you have to convince the electoral college and thats not always easy. So remember just because you won popular vote doesnt mean you won the majority of the electoral vote.

There are 5 reasons why we keep this method of electing the president. The first reason is Certainty of Outcome. This means ""it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" Which really means the candidates share to the other people in the Electoral college there share of the popular vote and thats how they vote. The second reason is Everyone's President. This is basically shows that ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" This means that no region such as south,northwest,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The third resone to keeping these methods is Swing States. This tells me that its the ""winner takes all method."" The fourth method why we should keep these methods is the Big States. This explains that ""the Electoral College restores some of the wieght in the political balance."" this means that the bigger states get a big advantage in the electoral because the people that get elected into office there is based off of population so they have an advantage. THe bigger states get more attention from the candates then the smaller states do. The final reason why we should keep this method of voting is Avoid RunOff Elections. This means ""the Electoral College aviods the problem of Elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast"". This means no pressure for candidates when they win majority of the votes cast.

There are many ways to develop and to hold the Electoral College together. There are many ways that it falls apart and has it flaws but its the best way for our econany to vote for president. If you think about it if we just did popularity vote that would be like leading our hands into a world of immigrates who know a very little. There a lot of rules for our Electoral process buyt its the best way and the only way we have to becoming a better place. Dont forget to look at the 5 reasons we keep this the way it is.",0
"Dear State Senator, I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the President of the United States instead of keeping the electoral college. The reasons I think that we should have it changed to the popular vote is because I think the people should be able to choose who should be our next president instead of having the electoral college also voting for the president of the United States.

Its not only me senator, but also these important men of our country all agree with me that we need to abolish the electoral college! These men are Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. Chamber of commerce.""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor."" I just find all of this unfair because its not just the United states giving there opinion on who should be there next leader but some other men who have favoritism for the opponents also vote too! One example of how i think the electoral college voters are unfair is back in the election of President Obama and Mr. rodney the electoral voters had 29 electoral votes for Obama and rodney only had 3. So, that election could have been more fair if we didnt have so much favoritism for one person to another. When we could have had a fair vote from the people and had the opinions on who should be there next President.

Now, in the defese of the electoral college it does help situations in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast which can be very helpful when examples happen like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 when they both had only 43 percent of the popular votes and the electoral college helped not make those elections as complicated. But, they still had a say so on who should be president and who shouldnt be president. I think that question should be answered by our own people!

Thank you so much State Senator for reading my opinion on the electoral college versus the popular vote for the President of the United States.",0
"Dear State Senator, most people in theis country may argue theat the Electoral College is well layed out system in which according to source 3: In Defense of thee Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised metheod of choosing a president ""The winnertakeall metheod of awarding electoral votes induces candidates to focus theeir campaign efforts on thee tossup states"", which means presidents are always looking for support from small states, which is based on population, to be voted for because in thee big states little to no votes are accepted by thee Electoral College. I disagree, I believe theat theis metheod is wrong and unfair for thee peope so I argue against it.

To begin withe, according to source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even thee bestlaid defenses of thee system are wrong ""At thee most basic level, thee electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of thee winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states theey know theey have no chance of winning, focusing only on thee tight races on thee ""swing"" states"", theis means theat in some states one candidate might have a better chance of winning thean thee otheer candidate and even theough a candidate is at disadvantage because thee otheer takes all thee votes because of thee electoral college theat candidate might win and thee people of theat state will not even know who is theis winning candidate until theey see him on tv as an actual president, which probably means theat thee winning candidate won't help theat state because he does not know well enough about it. Additionally, according to source 3 ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as rodney ws in thee Southe, has no incentive to campaign heavily in theose states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plularity in states theat he knows he will win"", theis means theat in order to win thee presidency a candidate must get to know otheer regions but because in theis case Mitt rodney vs. Barrack Obama, Obama was thee regional favorite for thee Northe rodney was at a disadvantage, which is what thee Electoral College ultimately wants.

To conclude withe, I theink theat thee metheod of using thee Electoral College to elect presidents is wrong and unfair. Furtheermore, according to source 2 ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdate, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions witheout much basis in reality"" theis means theat thee electoral college is just not fit for thee modern democrat world of today and mostly people argue against it.",0
"The Electoral College?

Some would say this way of voting is a lack of democratic pedigree and should be abolished. The Electoral College is when the people vote for the electors who are declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular vote. This act is not only unfair but injustice as well. The people should be able to vote directly on who they choose to govern over them. But instead we're using plurality, when a candidate receives more votes than other candidates while not receiving a clear majority of votes. Someone is chosen to speak for them. The Electoral College is very irrational and should be removed from the voting process system.

It's known to be said that those voting for slate of electorss half the time dont know what they're voting for. Some states have reported that they have yet to see campaign ads, or news regarding the election and therefore dont actually know who to pick. The president goes to the states heshe may think have ""swing"" votes and lets himherself be known pubilically to gain more votes. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. But what about the states who arent caught up to the political races and would like to know more about it. They may feel disenfranchised to feel that their votes don not matter. They may feel the new president may disregard their interest and is not interested in being everyone's president. People may believe by voting it goes directly to the candidate but in fact it goes to the electorss, who vote. When a vote is placed to a certain candidate it doesnt nessicisarly mean they are going to win. They may win the vote but could lose the presidency. It'd be better if everyone just had a say individually of who they wanted to take president. The Electoral College wasnt a very logical idea.

""Electors"" ? the Electors are slate of electorss who parties have selected to make a trusted vote towards the party's nominee.

Source 3, In Defense Of The Elecoral College: Five Reasons T o Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President States that the Electors are rare for the trust to be betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electorsal vote will not win the national popular vote. This hasnt happened sense 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then Bush yet fewer electorsal votes, but that was first time since 1888. But who's to say it can happen again. The Electoral College is a chance being taken that you may or may not win the election based on how many popular votes said person may recieve. This is no shocker that there have been disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote, its based on winnertakesall basis. Source 3, The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. This creates pressure for runoff elections, but is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. Voters in a presidential election are people who want to express a political prefernece rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election, but thats false.

The Electoral College? Its not one of the more favorable elections, and is sought out to be uncanny and unfit. The Electoral College is a way for people to interact with the politics taken place, but are manipulated into something else that takes away from being able to have a say in something that will effect said person. We live in a democracy, which means we vote but how can we vote when we don't know who we're voting for. The voting system should remain how it is, with willing participants placing a ballant and knowing that their vote is actually going to matter.",0
"Dear State Senator, I am agreeing in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There is no need to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. That is because the House of representatives helps elect for us, it helps us to balance our votes, and avoid problems of election. The electoral college helps the people out alot with the voting situation and helps us to better understand and know our new president.

The broader significance of the electoral College is that the House of Representatives helps us vote for our new president. In source One paragraph three it says ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equal the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each number in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators....""That tells me that we the people are not alone in this process of voting who will be our next president. Also in the same source but paragraph five it states ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" This informs me that not only the House of representatives is involved in the elections. Tthe government is important to the electoral College because the votes of the government count most to the College.

It is evident that the Electoral College helps us to balance our votes. As stated in Source Three ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" This lets me know that we as the people won't have to worry to much about the voting and selection of the president. Another piece of evidence stated in the same source and paragraph ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" That states that not all people and states have to worry about who the president will be. The Electoral College hepls us out alot mostly to the big states in the United States.

Above all the Electoral College avoid problems of the elections. In source Three, paragraph Twentytwo it states ""The Electoral College avoids problems of the elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" This lets us know that the Electoral College is doing a good job on keeping the votes clean and simple to understand. Also stated in the same source and paragraph ""There is no pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential electionn process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which ivariably producess a clear winner..."" That tells me that the Electoral College is keeping the votes on point.

There are some people out there who don't agree with the Electoral College and dont like the way the votes are being put in because sometimes the president that they chose wasn't elected. They are wrong to disagree with the Electoral College because the College keeps everything going in order and in a clear path to let us know who our president will be. As stated in Source Two paragraph Ten ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in tur elect the president. This makes them disagree because they think that the Electoral College doesn't vote for their president, but they souldn't worry because they way they vote is by how many states helped the electors to vote for that presient being chosen as the president. Also In Source Two ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That makes some people diagree also, but the Electoral College doesn't count how many people in each big or small state voted for president. All the college does is help the governmtent elect for the president that they most support and elect for.

I agree that the Electoral College should be kept in favor because of all the help that it gives us and the government. Also the College helps us stay balanced on the votes so that nothing gets missplaced or missunderstood. Most of all it avoids problems during the election so that the people and the government are satisfied with their votes. The Eletroal College is a great way to keep things going at a clear election of the year. The Electoral College doesn't need any changes for me because even if they chose on the elections of the government the votes of the people still count to them as well. The votes of the peopel are important to the Electoral College just as much as the government's votes are.",0
"The Electoral College is best described as outdated and obsolete. It was designed so that, when there were too many states and poor technology, the vote could be fairly and realistically counted, by voting between a few people from each state. This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the allornothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information.

When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccounted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notepad that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, receipt, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue ""Enter"" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we?

The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state. He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 711 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, ""That girl Suzie's"" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. But wait! there's more. Most states have an allornothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair. It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California 55, Texas 38, and Florida 29, while smaller states get less, such as Alaska 3, Rhode Island 3, and Hawaii 4. Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 17001800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.",0
"Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save money. Also due to many different reasons, even if it's for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it's China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minimize pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren't the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are.

In Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park"" Rosenthal 2 but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. ""Carowners can buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" Rosenthal 2 That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars "" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of vaughn's Families don't even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn't that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don't have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely.

Due to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a ""partial driving ban to clear the air or global city"" Duffer 10. For example, in this article called "" "" by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be 31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn't produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn't have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn't really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about ""4,000 drivers were fined,"" and ""27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" Duffer 12. Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" Duffer 14. The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough.

Bogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia.

For a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of ""7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines."" Selsky 21 Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has ""118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City."" Selsky 27 One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries.

Yet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called "" "", is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Rosenthal 29 The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, ""Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" Rosenthal 29. New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It's already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn't there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be.

To wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air unless it's a hybrid. The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages.",0
"Society has made the car industry accelerate rapidly and over the years the amount of money these automobile company's make only increases. However, its time to look into the advantages of limiting such car usage in our communities. Studies have shown that the use of cars only increases the amount of stress we have. Without the usage of cars we're able to release such stressors Carlos Arturo Plaza stated in Andrew Selsky's article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". Its one thing to make the decision to start this movement on our own, but when a community becomes involved it makes a stronger impact. Car usage in America has only grown since it began however, the amount of cars being bought is beginning to show decrease. Many people are realizing that there are numerous amounts of ways to get around their city. Some are even carpooling. Although choosing other options such as the bus may take time it is still well worth the wait. We will find that many other options and opportunities come into play when we cut down on and get rid of the use of cars in our communities.

Various factors come into play when it comes to world pollution. One of the factors being the use of automobiles which increases the amount of air pollution thus damaging the ozone layer. The use of cars is second nature to us. We love the sense of indepence we get at the age of 16 when we can finally get our license. To point out, no one thinks on whats happening as we purchase cars. Instead, we rely on diesel gas to do the trick. Imagine cutting out the use of cars. With this detuction of car usage the amount of destruction done to the ozone layer will diminish tremendously. We will be able to experience clearer air just like the communities that participate in this action. For instance, in an article done by Robert Duffer titled ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" we can witness through testimony the wonders done by banning car usage. Normally Paris has high amounts of pollution but in order to change this the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air temporarily. The fact that the city had cold nights and warm days doesn't do anything to help because these nights and days only allow for the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. After the banning of car usage Paris was finally able to experience clear air. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 ,micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with the 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London... "" excerpt from source 2 ""Paris bans driving due to smog"".

To be clear, no one's against car usage, but after considering the costs of using cars you'd realize its not worth it. Residents of Vanban, Germany find this statement to be true and have therefore regulated their lives around it. Elizabeth Rosenthal created an article on the residents from Germany titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goesn On Without Cars"". Here she discussed what the community has done in their no car movement. Residents here do not regret their decision to get rid of their cars and actually like it better than dealing with the uncontrollable and frustrating traffic jams. Not to mention the countless amount of car wrecks that come along with it. In this particular part of Germany the government has assisted in the movement. There are no street parking spots, driveways or home garages. Some might think its absurd but when theres no cars theres no need for such things. They have even improved sidewalks and made the city commute friendly with stores only a walk distance away. A mother from Germany gives her account of living in Vauban and states the following: ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" She is a media trainer and a mother of two. In previous bills, 80 percent of the money from the government had gone to highways and 20 percent to other transports, but with the smart planning movement that will change within the next 6 years.

All in all, many factors come into play when discussing transportation within a city. However with the deduction of car use a city can recieve many benefits including an increase in money for other government spending, clearer air, happiness, more money in their pockets among many other things. We just have to decide whether enough is enough.",0
"The majority of Americans have the luxury of owning a car. A car of course, seems like a useful innovation. It gets you places quickly and efficiently, and is easier than walking. Yet so many people drive cars that the roads get congested and clogged easily as the cars just idle in the road waiting for the traffic jam to loosen up. Car usage causes the environment to decline and an increase in air pollution, it would be a great idea to lower car usage since it is so detrimental to the health of the environment and the health of the populace.

An advantage to reducing car usage is a more beneficial environment and a better overall health standard. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some... areas in the United States."" Source 1. Personal cars directly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and by cutting down personal car usage and encouraging the use of car pooling and public transportation we can decrease greenhouse gas emmmisions. Also walking and biking to your destination instead of driving helps encourage healthy living and habits as well as exercise.

Cars also cause pollution and smog to hang over cities causing the air to be full of harmful chemicals, endagering peoples health and also causing a rise in asthma for the populace that lives inside the city. In places like Beijing,China smog and pollution from cars cause the air to be so foggy and dirty that you cannot even see the sky. ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Source 2. When Paris was accosted by the same problem they solved it by a temporary ban on driving to clear the air. Without so many people driving cars we wouldn't have these many issues with smog and it's effect on the environment. With less car usage smog and pollution would drop.

Driving not only creates an issue with air pollution but also with water pollution and the contamination of the earth. Cars run on gasoline, a fossil fuel. Which is brought up from underground by drilling into the earth. Fracking often has a negative effect on the earth, often causing oil spills into the ocean or earth. The effect of the oil spill is pollution and mass death of wildlife in that area. By using alternative methods of transportation such as trains,buses,taxis,subways, walking and biking we reduce the amount of gas used and also the amount of car emmissons released into the air. Cars guzzle gasoline and this causes a huge need for fossil fuel, by using cars less we lessen the need for gasoline.

Many people agree with the statment that without cars their lives are easier and less stressful due to the fact that they no longer have to worry about traffic jams and car crashes as well as any other dangerous event that can happen while driving. This excerpt from the third source, shows a man's reply to the event Day Without Cars that takes place in Bogota,Colombia once a year. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.""Source 3. This excerpt only furthers my point that less car usage causes people to be more calm and less worried or stressed. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter"" Source 1. This quote from source 1 which discusses a suburb in Germany that is carfree. This blurb shows another example of someone who became happier without a car. Another advantage to reducing car usage is less stress.

Also to some people a car is just a backup for when public transportation falls through. ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transporation or carpool with friends."" Source 4 By reducing uneeded car usage we cause a more effiecent society less dependent on cars and more dependent on better types of alternative transportation. ""'A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART type of public transport doesn't work.'"" Source 4. By improving public transport we reduce car usage which improves the environment and quality of life.

Less car usage will help the environment as well as lower stress. ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisons."" Source 4. By eliminating uneeded car usage and introducing more public transportation and alternate means of transport we will be eliminating one of the greatest causes of greenhouse gas emissions in America. The advantages of eliminating car usage is less pollution, healthier living and a less stressful life.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage and many people are starting to see it. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" By Elisabeth Rosenthal She goes to explain that in Vauban, Germany there is a community that have given up on cars. Without a car on the streets you can tell its more lively with the quote ""Heidrun walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked berdants streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" With that quote from the article you can tell that the streets are filled with the sound of people rather than the sound of motors and smoke from the vehicles.

certainly not having cars is a great advantage to suburbs, in Rosenthal article it said "" there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking... in attempt to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation... in this new approach, stores are placed a walk away..."" Instead of wasting gas and filling the air with disgusting gas, stores could be just around the corner. Which in return would be easier for everyone around. Even the united states, environmental protection agency is promoting""car reduced"" communities.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is to reduce smog and air pollution, in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robery duffer he informs us that paris actually enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It stated "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... the smog rivaled Bejing,china, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" By banning driving they not only were able to reduce the smog and air pollution, They obviously reduced car traffic!

Also In the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, they banned car in an effort to promote alternative transportation and reduce spog. In the article is said ""parks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad , smooth sidewalks rushhouse restrictins have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants andupscale shopping districts have cropped up."" The day also is said to help lower stress, "" It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air population,""said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.

As you can tell from the facts within this essay, there are definitly many advantages with limiting car usage, from reducing smog and pollution, to having stores built closer to home. These advantages not only help the citzens but also the planet we live on, and our future children and their children and so on...",0
"The wheel was the first step that took society into the making of the mobile car. Today millions of cars are made each year to help humans transport around the cities and streets around the world. Every vehicle that is powered by gasoline emits carbon dioxide, this gas is very harmful for the environment, it causes the ozone later to slowly dissolve and it also causes acid rains. Traffic jams is one of the many effects of having too many cars in a certain populated area. Debt has also been an influential part in the quantity of cars around the globe. Car usage and production should be drastically reduced to ensure a better future for all living things in the Planet Earth.

Furthermore, Global warming has slowly made its toll on Earth, most of which has been produced by the Carbon Dioxide gases in the atmosphere, this gas is a mayor green house gas. Over the years cars have been more extensively used and have a great percentage in world contamination, As stated in article 1 paragraph 5 ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the united states"". This being, if car production and usage are reduced, Earth will have positive reactions to this change. The levels of global warming will also be reduced all around, this will help us conserve our north and south poles for a longer period of time, keeping safe all the animals related to that area like penguinzs and polar bears.

In addition, Traffic jams arent the most pleasant place to be, due to the fact that they're unpredictable and in most cases highly annoying. Information from passage 2 paragraph 14 states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france"", this was due to oderly assigning days in which certain cars with certain license plates can drive through the cities of france. Less congestion means higher percent in mobility all around, this can greatly effect a 3 hour traffic jam to a simple 20 minute ride. Coming and going from places can be a brease, and this will also facilitate extra time for other potential activities. Reducing car usage and congestion can also lead to less accidents and car crashes.

Moreover, Leasing or buying a new car can come heavy on the pocket. Financial debt has been trounced ever since a currency started, debt is unpredictable sometimes and can happen to any individual. Having the latest model of a car can be a luxury only some can afford, the individuals who try and cant afford it ussually end up in debt, as reinforced in article 4 paragraph 32 ""Cash Strapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway"". Ussually some individuals ""bite more than they can chew"" and this can harm not only one indivual, but the economy as a whole. Reducing the mayor debt that can come from car leasing can improve a counrtys economy and benift milliones of individuals.

Concluding, many reasons show society to reduce the usage of cars. One being that gasoline and petrolium powered cars can contaminate the planet Earth, melt our poles, destroy the ozone layer and cause harmful weather effects. Also, the reduction of cars can lead to the decongestion of cities in which indiviuals can more easily and freely move around adding time for them to use as they like. Lastly, the economy can have a mayor boost if car reduction and usage from leasing can occur. In conclusion, the reduction of car usage and production is a great benefit for every individual who lives on Earth, and can lead to many great outcomes that will help members of society enjoy a better life style and have a safer future.",0
"While many may argue for it, the Electoral College has proved to be an obsolete way of electing the President. It is, essentially, an indirect way for voters to choose their candidates, by voting for electors whose loyalty is not guaranteed. The Electoral College vote can override the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 Presidential Election. Some say that the Electoral College is a system worth keeping, because it provides a certain outcome and avoids runoff elections, yet these arguments are founded on little reason.

Undoubtedly outdated, this system is a catastrophe in the works, the 2000 election only a glimpse of the chaos that could result from the Electoral College. The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy 11. Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occasionally, it is yet another fault in this system.

Not only is the Electoral College irrational, it is also simply unfair. Each state can only cast a single vote, so the one representative in Wyoming, who represents only 500 thousand, would have as much say as California's 55 representatives, who represent 35 million voters 12. Other sources say a tie would be unlikely. However, in 1979 in Ohio, it would have only taken a few thousand voters to vote the other way 12. Because of the ""winnertakeall"" system, certain states are left untouched by candidates who know they won't win them. In 2000, certain states didn't even see the candidates, and didn't air campaign ads, denying voters of a chance to further favor or favor them 13.

It is simple, the Electoral College system is a turnoff for many voters, especially after the incident in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote. Voters can be discouraged if they have no hope of carrying their state, like Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in Cali 23. Assuming that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election 23"" is rather incorrect. Single votes could absolutely sway an election, as mentioned earlier. Relying on the popular vote may make a tie more likely, but it would free voters from an obsolete and untrustworthy system. Over 60 percent of voters oppose the Electoral College 9 which is enough to bring attention to these facts and, hopefully, address them before another controversial occurance.

The evidence is all layed out, mishaps and nearmishaps, an impending catastrophe all too possible for comfort, unfair to potential voters. The Electoral College doesn't deserve its defenders. 2000 proved it, the voters have spoken up, and it is indisputably irrational to continue to rely on it. The system has been around for a while, and it will stay in place for the next few years, most likely. However, because of the light now being shined on its faults, it could have a chance to be reformed for the better.",0
"By limiting car usage, research has shown there is less greenhouse gas emissions, a promotion in alternative transportation, and can result in a new and improved safe society.

To begin, the advantages of limiting car usage reduces the amount of pollution that is emitted into the air, resulting in a more environmental friendly neighborhood. According to research in Vauban, Germany, ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Source 1 Many locations around the world are taking this act into perspectiveincluding not only Vauban,Germanybut also Paris,France, Bogota,Colombia, and even cities in the United States that are reducing these numbers drastically and making a beneficial change in the environment. ""If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Next, with the declining usage of cars, citizens are left with alternative transportation that are beneficial. Many people have gone from driving carsgetting from point A to point Bto visiting parks and sports centers, which can lead to an increase in physical activity. Another advantage to giving up your car can also lead to less traffic. According to the new routine in Colombia, ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.""Source 3 In Paris, officials are enforcing drivers to clear the air of the global city with a partial driving ban. With this new ban in play, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" Source 2 Since the change, public transit from Friday to Monday was free of charge. As you can see, these changes are coming into effect and are changing the world in various positive ways.

Heidrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this wayreferring to giving her car up. Source 3 Businessman Carls arturo Plaza also says, ""This is a good opportunity to reduce stress and lower air pollution."" Source 3 In addition, the reduction of car usage leads to a safer environment. According to my. Sivak's research, ""There has been a large drop in the pecentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age.""Source 4 A study found that driving by young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. With this evolutionary change in peoples everyday lives, many large numbers are drastically going down, revealing numerous advantages. The number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak, the rates of car ownership per household and per person has started to come down two to three years before the downturn, and demographic shifts in the driving population all reveal that people may find less reason to resume to their cardriven habits.

To conclude, the limiting of car usage can improve the environent, can result in numerous transportation opportunities, and can lead to a safer society.",0
"Whether we have our license or not, we can all relate to the stress of the daily commute. As of the past century, cars have been one of the most efficient ways to get from point A to point B. Now, mainly due to air pollution, there has been a noticeable decline in the amount of cars used for travel. The advantages of limiting car usage include less stress, less air pollution, and an overall improved society.

The stress of traffic and the constant pressure to be on time would be significantly reduced if people chose other means of transportation such as riding a bike, taking public transportation such as the subway or bus, or walking. Source 1 shows just how effective decreased car usage can be. It describes Vauban, Germany, a small suburb community in which there is virtually no car usage. Many citizens report being less tense, as everything is made within means of walking distance.

Another cause of stress from car usage is the effects it has on the atmosphere. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.Source 1 Paris is an excellent example of just how much car usage has had such negative effects on the atmosphere. Source 2 explains how Paris was so smog ridden it rivaled Bejing, China. Paris then placed limits on car usage until the smog cleared enough for the ban to be lifted.

Not only does decreased car usage help the planet, it helps society as a whole. Source 3 describes Bogota, Columbia and how it celebrates one day a year of no car usage. The city has found that not only has this policy helped clear the smog, but it is enthusiastically endorsed by the citizens. Most people turned out to see the bike races, despite the occasional rain showers. This has caused two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar to join the event. Bogota has seen the construction of 118 bike paths, the most of any Latin American city. It is not just the government endorsing decreased car usage but people themselves. Source 4 points out how the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the peak. There are various explanation for why people are driving less, one might be that the internet makes increased telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without having to drive to them.

It is evident that we are witnessing a major cultural shift, possible degressing, but in the best possible way. The decreased incline to drive has resulted in less air pollution, a less stressed population, and an improved society overall.",0
"In the westminster system, the head of state and or government is elected by the majority of both houses of their respective national legislature. In the popular vote system, the head of state and or government is elected by the majority of the nation. Unlike the westminster system, the popular vote system has a vast array of ways to carryout the elections. Tyrants sway the people and if the people are sovereign we can't let them hold all the power when they can easily be misguided. For the safety of freedom against tyranny and for the safety of the people's sovereignty the United States must ensure the continuity of the Electoral College.

The united states of america is the oldest surviving republic in modern day times. This is because our founding fathers were some of the greatest thinkers in american history. the idea of the electoral college was heavily influenced by the English system of government and also the Iriqouis Confederacy though it is usually unrecognized due to the fact that many americans, at the time, thought Native Americans were savages. One of the principles of English government the founding fathers used was the idea of electing heads of the nation. in the United Kingdom the Prime Minister, i. e. the head of government, was elected by the majority of the house of commons and then approval by some higher authority to ensure the vote was valid and legitimate. Our founding fathers were afraid of a popularly elected dictator who would bring down the principles of republicans and democratic institutions. So the Founding Fathers decided to create a system where the head of state and his office where responsible and questionable to the Federal legislature the United States Congress. He could be impeached by congress if he had committed crimes and removed from office if he was unfit to carry out the duties he was entrusted with. The electoral college was made to ensure that despotism never happens in the United States. Adolf Hitler was never elected to any office, he was appointed to the chancellorship of Germany by President Hindenburg because Hitler held the people's trust and approval. Benito Mussolini was appointed Prime Minister of Italy by the King because he had the people on his side. This cannot happen in the United States because we have the Electoral College. the electors of the President are ordinary people that no one really knows whom they are. the electoral college is not democratic and it was not supposed to be. This is representative democracy or republicans. According to Richard A. Posner,""...the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" Governments are flawed and some are so corrupt and abusive that their extremitites cannot be mentioned. The United States government and congress have always had the interests of the people in their mind. However, there is a rising faction of people of the united states that want to remove the electoral college, one of whom was Richard Milhouse Nixon who was the 37th president of the united states and was the only person to resign the office due to unconstitutional scandals. this growing faction states that because the Electoral College is not democratic enough that it should be done away with. According to Bradford Plumer,""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" What many forget to realize is that the Electoral College is a Presidium for the elections, it presides over and gives the real vote in the elections because it comprises of random people representing both the states and the states' populations. This is representation in the election process.

The Electoral College is the people's representation. It was made by the Founding Fathers of the united States for a purpose. though many not approve of the Electoral College, many of our nation's greatest presidents were elected by it like John F. Kennedy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson. To ensure the safety of freedom against tyranny and for the safety of the people's sovereignty the United States must ensure the continuity of the Electoral College.",0
"Dear Senator, The electoral college was a perfect way of electing, in the 1900's. Now, we should be allowing the people of the United States decide who they want to be their president. Not only is this inequality, but it is deceiving and unfair. I know people say ""Life's unfair."" and while it is, we should be doing our best to keep our country in line. We are already in a steep pile of debt. Obama has only made this worse. Why was he elected? Mostly because he is part of a minority. Inequality much?

U.S. citizens are being put to shame by every elector in the electoral college. We have the right to vote, for electors. And these electors barely ever follow suit. Not only do they stray from what the people want, they also take away our authority in the government. If we have the right to vote, then let us vote on wether or not to keep the electoral college. I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one who has these thoughts. I understand that I am simply a child and that you have no reason to listen to me, but if not me, listen to the rest of our country.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

passage 2, paragraph 10 As stated by Bradford Plumer, we do not elect our president. If we did, Al Gore would have been our president in 2000. If all men are equal, then why are you choosing certain people over the U.S. population. It is utterly deceiving to take our votes and throw them away, to make us think that our votes matter when they really don't. If this is who you want to choose our president, then don't have us vote.

Although people say that the electoral college takes away the chance of majority, that's how the system works. How do you think the president wins? They like to call it winnertakesall. That is a nice way to put it. The president is decided by the majority of votes in the electoral college. What puts these electors above me? I am young, but I have a working mind just like my parents. Why do my parents votes get pushed to the side and ignored? The reason is because the U.S. is a lying and unfair country. They tell us that we are the ones who control the government, yet they put our own people above us.

America has been going downhill and that is all that will continue if we dont change something. Getting rid of the electoral college will allow us to prosper. Why listen to a young teenager? Well, I know how it feels to be put on the bottom of the ladder, even if you are the smartest. America knows what is best for us. Not a few people chosen in each state to represent what they themselves want. Let us choose the president once, and if it doesn't work out, then you can continue your way. Just remember, if you never shoot for the moon, you will never reach the stars.",0
"Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. vaughn's streets are entirely ""carfree"" except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for 40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of vaughn's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning."" According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. The same would apply to the oddnumbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just fivedays of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates the following day.

Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this carfree day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, ""Day Without Cars."" 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle.

Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T the home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally."" Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. ""I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Many people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being safety, money, and pollution.",0
"Think about how many times a week we get in a car to drive somewhere. I know I drive to school, to lacrosse practice, and to spend time with friends on a weekly basis. Some people may claim that driving is a positive aspect of our culture because it allows us to get from one place to another and accomplish tasks in a timely fashion, but driving in excess has some serious consequences. Although some may argue that it is impossible to completely cut out an action that is essential to our daily lives, and that cutting down on driving would not be advantageous, limiting the amount of time we spend driving has many advantages. Cutting down on automobile use will decrease pollution in our air, and make us healthier and happier, which is why many legislators and cities are reducing automobile use.

Beijing, China, is the most polluted city in the world according to Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune in 2014. source 2 paragraph 14 This is due to the fact that being's automobile use is extremely high. When the city of Paris was faced with a similar crisis, it issued a partial driving ban that allowed people to only drive on days that the government said they could in accordance to their licence plate number, or they would face a fine. source 2 paragraph 1019. This revolutionary ban caused the air pollution in Paris to drop so much that the ban was lifted after only one day. The drop in air pollution clearly refutes the claim that cutting down on driving is not advantageous. Cutting down on automobile use is beneficial to the environment because, according to Elizabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times in 2009 source 1 paragraph 5, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Limiting automobile use is crucial to cleaning our air and stopping the burning of fossil fuels, thus explains why is beneficial to limit our car use.

Although some might argue that driving a car to work is easier, evidence shows that people who limit their car use are happier and healthier. Rosenthal writes about the city of Vauban, Germany, where ""70% of vaughn's families do not own a car."" source 1 paragraph 3 Heidrum Walter, a carless citizen from Vauban, states that, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" source 1 paragraph 3 The concept of people being happier and healthier without cars is further proved in Bogota, Columbia, where, according to Andrew Selsky of the Seattle Times in 2002, ""For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million."" source 3 paragraph 21 Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""as he rode his bike with his wife. The statements from Walter of Vauban and Plaza of Bogota show how limiting automobile use is advantageous to the overall wellbeing and happiness of people, thus we should limit our automotive use.

Limiting automobile use is so beneficial, that many groups and legislators are supporting a society with less cars. The EPA in the United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act. source 1 paragraph 9 David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, states that, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociology proffesor at Drecel University, Mimi Sheller, further elaborates, stating, ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift."" source 4 paragraph 35 The support for a ""car reduced"" society by the US government and the EPA is the cherry on top to all of the benefits associated with driving less, thus we should limit our automobile use.

Society is changing. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. source 4 paragraph 41 Now is the time to turn off the engine, get out of the car, and take a bus, bike, or train to work. By limiting our automobile use, we keep our air clean by burning less fossil fuels, and we are happier and healthier, which is why organizations like the EPA support the reduction of car use. We need to act today to save the next generation of citizens from ecological destruction. The benefits of reducing car use are countless, which explains why we should limit our automobile use.",0
"Dear Florida senator, I'm a young student, and no I don't haye much of a background in political ideas or things, but I know we should keep the Electoral College. This old process was created to make electing a President easier and faster, which I belieye it does.

Now, the Electoral College has 538 electors, but a majority of 270 electoral yotes is required to elect the President. Some will argue that we aren't yoting for a President but we're yoting for the people, or electors, behind them. I would say that they aren't wrong, but we aren't just yoting for those electors, we are yoting for the whole idea behind their campaigning. We don't yote for the person, we yote for the idea that person agrees to carry out. By haying this process, we can focus on getting swing states yotes. The yotes of these states matter the most, in my opinion, because they are likely to swing at any minute. As said in "" In Defense of the Electoral College: Fiye reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President "", ""swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that the are going to decide the election."" This helps ayoid runon elections because the small states are likey to just yote for the most popular President, knowing their yote won't really make a difference.

Most states haye a ""winnertakeall"" system that giyes all of the electors to the winning candidate. Howeyer, there are a few states that haye yariation with the ""proportional representation"" idea. The ""winnertakeall"" system actually works really well. Other parts of the Electoral College has it's problems but not this one. With this process it makes it easy to giye all of the yotes to one person, this means all of the state will be on the same page and not fighting with itself. This process y. proportional representation, is better in my opinion because it's quicker and helps make the presidential process one step easier.

And lastly, it's a tradition to use the Electoral College. The pedigree for this process was created a really long time ago by some of the most outstanding leaders in our country. The article "" What Is the Electoral College?

"" states that, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a yote in Congress and election of the President by a popular yote of qualified citizens."" The process we created as the United States, has its up and downs but it is one of the longest standing traditions we haye. Hopefully you take my letter in to consideration. Thank you for reading.",0
"Dear state senator, There should be a change in the Electoral College. It should be changed to electing presidents by popular vote. It is our right to vote for someone who would actually make changes in our society and make our lives different. The fact that we have to vote electors for those electors to choose our president, it seems unfair. Also, the purpose of voting for president is for everybody to vote not just citizens. Therefore, there should be some changes for voting.

To continue, election of presidents by popular vote should be used in the United States. If we are voting for presidents, then why should us ,citizens, vote for electors in order for them to vote for our president? As stated in source 2 ""The indefensible Electoral College"",""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state,candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing""states."" In addition, it states in source 3 ""In defense of the Electoral College"","" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them.

Furthermore, everyone should be allowed to vote not just citizens. The fact that not everybody are qualified citizens to vote, then the amount of votes would be vague. This process is similar to not having enough electoral votes. The votes would not be popular or in a great amount for that specific place. For example, as it mentions in source 3, ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average..."" There should not be any thoughtful voters deciding on the election. It makes it unfair for those who want to vote but are not allowed.

On the other hand, Electoral College could have benefits. In this process it is easier for the electors who are voting. If there is a tie in votes, then they can pass it on to the House of Representatives in which state delegations take care of the voting. At least with this process, they have their own system set up and if any problems, they know in what way it can be fixed. Unlike voting by popular vote, it can cause some problems because not everyone is allowed to vote and there could be few votes for candidates which would have a negative outcome. However, it would be the same for the Electoral College because there would be not enough electors in regions.

In conclusion, election by popular vote for the president of the United States should be used. It could change society and it will allow us to have a better living. This could give us a chance to vote and feel part of the election.",0
"The automobile is a production commonly used by individuals all over the world. But utilization of this transportation vehicle arouses environmental damage as well as stress. Limiting car usage around the world would be greatly beneficial.

Limiting automobile usage would decrease hazardous rates of air pollution in regions at which cars are commonly driven. The tailpipe of cars release toxins, often produced by the automobiles fuel, that severely pollute the environment once in the air. According to experts, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50%...in the United States""Source 1. This amplifies the dangerous impact automobiles have on the environment. Paris, a carusing country, reached extreme levels of smog due to automobile emissions. According to Reuters, ""Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic matter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London""Source 2. Due to this, a ban was made on car usage and the smog eventually cleared. automobiles emissions of greenhouse gases are utterly harmful for the environment.

Decreasing the utilization of automobiles would also ease stress levels among the community. In Vauban, Germany, cars are practically forbidden causing the suburbs streets to be free of the persistent humming of a motor. ""When I had a car I was actually tense. I'm much happier this way,""Source 1 says Heidrun Walter, a citizen of the carfree city. This illustrates how the loss of automobiles can bring tranquility to a region. Bogota, Columbia hosts the Day Without Cars, a day where the driving of an automobile is not permitted. According to Andrew Selsky, due to this occasion, ""pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" and ""rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic""Source 3. Lowering the usage of automobiles would relieve individuals of density caused by driving.

Automobiles are an exemplary form of transportation but their impact isn't as beneficial for other purposes. Car emissions of greenhouse gases promote global warming and traffic only tenses drivers. Limiting the utilization of these vehicles would decrease if not diminish their negative impacts on the world.",0
"Dear Senator, I would like to bring to your attention the matter of the electoral college, and the unjust way that presidents are elected in our country. While there are benefits, more of the negative effects come to play when reviewing and contemplating on whether this system is effect or not. The Electoral College is very unfair, and should be subject for abolishment.

The number of electors in the Electoral College consist of 538 electors in total, which makes a tie completely possible, although it has never happened, in the past only a few more votes were required to create this unlikely problem. According to source 3, paragraph 18, Richard A. Posner claims that, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely..."" There's a shockingly short amount of votes required to turn an election into a situation where both candidates have an even number of votes, a problem almost occurred in 1976, that were if, according to source 2, paragraph 12, Bradford Plumer, ""a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" Those may look as if they are big numbers, however in comparison to the amount of voters in each state, these are not large amounts of people who needed to vote the other way. In comparison, the number of representatives is determined by the number of members in your congressional delegation, the amount of electors per state is fair. Still, however, the event of a tie would cause a lot of issues within our country, and would be relieved if the winner was elected by popular vote.

In addition, electors are United States citizens, and are entitled to their own vote based on the Constitution, while they are allotted their own vote, this gives opportunity for problems to arise. Politics are very lowkey orders of business, and in 1960, the legislatures in Louisiana almost used the disaster factor to swing the election in their favor, by electing people who were more likley to vote for the opposer of John F. Kennedy, because they preferred the other candidate. According to source 3, paragraph 16, Posner addresses, ""..each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nomie and that trust is rarely betrayed""... however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" Since the electors can technically vote for whoever they desire, it can cause an unfair advantage to the electors sent who vote for the other candiate. The other factor tying in is that the voters feel as if their direct vote does not count. While it is true one vote cannot sway the election, it becomes apparent that candidates must have transregional appeal, meaning that they're favored in that region of the U.S. The candidates hold off on campaigning in states they already know they have dominated the votes in, because there is no one region that can elect a president. This makes voter feel inferior, and discourage them from ""wasting"" their time voting. If we use the majority of votes way to establish the new president, it is more likely that they will decide to vote once again, since they feel as if their opinion once again matters.

As you may recall, the 2000 election had a dispute between the popular vote. Confusion with the votes in a state that decides which kind of electors to send to vote creates issues, because it is unclear which the majority goes to, a candidate may recieve more votes than the others. This creates an advantage to a candiate, and makes a problem for the people who voted for the other candidate. Also, in source 3, paragraph 22, Posner expresses the issues when a runoff election occurs. Some candidates will not win a majority of casted votes, the pressure complicates the presidential election, leaving the true, clear descion to the Electoral College.

In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted. Thank you for your time.",0
"Dear Senator, I along with many other citizens have came to the conclusion that the Electoral College worth keeping. Though, the process itself has loose ends, overall it benefits the state and national election. The system uses general influence and a representative style of voting that makes the ballot more stable and dependable.

As a start, Electoral College electors are decided upon by the people. This means an elector with similar beliefs to the citizens will be chosen and most likely decide their vote in consideration of popular demand. Each state is given representatives in proportion to the population of the state. These people can be anyone who does not work in office and maybe a regular American who is probably going to empathize with the needs of the public and if chosen correctly will stand by the option of the state. Electoral College gives a more concentrated form of voting.

In addition, some may argue that the Electoral College is risky and a representative may not always stay true to their word, but isn't this the case with all types of voting? A presidential candidate makes many a promise during their race for Chief Executive and there is no way to be completely certain that these oaths will hold true. The same goes for the Electoral College. Citizens must have faith in the candidate as they would in the presidential election that they will put their country or state before personal wants and carry out their responsibilities honestly. The Electoral College process requires trust like any other form of election.

Lastly, though people may not want to believe it, the Electoral College brings a certainty to the ballot that popular vote could not do alone. Having a presidential tie could be the messiest turnout of an election, but with representative voting we can tip the scale in either way, in the interest of any state or party. It's a game of chance, but sure enough works better than flipping a coin! The Electoral College makes the voting system more reliable.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept as a part of the voting system because it gives a more concentrated form of voting, it only needs the same amount of trust betweencitizen and candidate as every other election style, and overall makes the voting system more reliable.",0
"Cars have been the main use for transportation from one distant destination to another. The population is relying on cars more often to get them to were they need to be. Everyone in the communities are becoming lazier and cannot bother to grab a bike or even a pair of skates to help them get where they need to go. More and more of the population do not want to walk to the store which is usually down the street. Cars have even been polluting the atmosphere causing numerous issues, such as health problems and even a rise in the temperature of the planet. The purpose of this essay is to inform fellow citizens of the advantages of limiting car usage.

By limiting the amount of cars we have in the country or even by reducing the days one can use their car, can dramatically reduce the pollution in the atmosphere and also cause citizens to become more active and healthy. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders.""Source 1, Paragraph 2. Vauban is one community to begin their journey to becoming a car reduced area. ""As a result, seventy percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and fiftyseven percent sold a car to move here.""Source 1, paragraph 3. As said by one of the residents, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heindrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.""Source 1, paragraph 3.

Paris is another city to take on the challenge of limiting the use of cars. Paris is a city where there is an abundance od smog and pollution. ""After days of nearrecord pollution Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Source 2, paragraph 10. Because of such effort, ""Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...""Source 2, paragraph 14. By limiting car usage citizens have only one option, to get up find a bike or running shoes and set out for the day. By doing this the peoples can become very healthy and reduce the chances of life threatening illnesses, such as cancer and others such as diabetes and lung and heart problems. Just think of the environment, by using less cars we can lower of even completely stop the effects of global warming which can lower the the rising of the sea and help to stop the destruction of the ozone.

""BOGOTA, ColombiaIn a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or even took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of trafic jams.""Source 3, paragraph 20. These simple and energizing activities can get you to where you need to be and also gets and keep you active and moving. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.""Source 3, paragraph 24. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift, "" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center.""Source 4, paragraph 35. The world is changing and with it the health of the people and the condition of the environment.

By taking time from using motor vehicles we can lower the pollution of the world and improve the health of the people who live in it. By lowering the production of cars, citizens will have no choice but to grab their bikes or skates or even running shoes and begin to move. The time is now for the community to change. Many different cities have already started their change with cars and now is the time for you to join in the movement. One step at a time.",0
"The Electoral College is a controversial topic in the US. This is the system used to elect the president of the United States, but most people 60% of Americans, according to source 1 believe that we shouldn't use this particular system and that we should go with the popular vote instead, while all others are strong in their stance that we should continue its use. Under the Electoral College, it is entirely possible for a Presidential Candidate to win presidency, even with the majority of voters voting for the opposing candidate. We should discard the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote.

The Electoral College is a system that allows a certain amount of electoral votes to each state. Each state is given 2 electoral votes plus another amount of votes which depends on that state's population. The amount of votes ranges from 3 to 55 source 3. A candidate must receive 270 out of 538 possible votes. The candidate the electoral votes of a state go to is decided by the majority vote of each individual state. In all states but Maine and Nebraska give a candidate the entirety of their votes if the majority of its citizen votes for them source 1. Some people don't even bother voting due to the fact that their vote will not contribute to their favored candidate's election. This happens often when a democratic voter lives in a republican state, and vice versa source 3 Many people stand by the Electoral College as the best course of action. They argue that the certainty of the winner is better, a candidate can't win the election due to regional favor, and this system ensures that there will still be a clear winner even when each candidate receives the same percentage of votes.

We began using the Electoral College in order to ensure that states with low populations weren't ignored by presidential campaigns. However, it fails to do just that. Presidential candidates focus their attention to swing states, in order to win their electoral votes. Candidates have little to no need to campaign in states that have a majority of one party, because their vote is either a lost cause or all but garunteed. If this system does not do the job that it was originally intended for, then why do we continue to use it?

In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.",0
"Dear Senator, The debate regarding the necessity of the Electoral College and it's validity has aroused some tension among the citizens of America, and the government as well. This process is not only used to decide the President of our nation, but to ensure the equality of the voting. By establishing our county as a democracy, we made a promise to maintain a systematic balance between the government and it's people. Without the existence of the Electoral College, where would this balance be? The Electoral College is the basis upon which our country is built, and is vital to uphold the balance and equality between government and people.

The Electoral College has many benefits towards the nation that many people are unaware of. For example, in order to do well, a candidate must have connections nationwide. In source 3, line 19, it states ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" This means that no candidate is guaranteed a win if they only appeal to one area or region. This creates an overall balance throughout the nation, and makes sure only a portion of the country doesn't have all the power. Also, this allows the people to have a clear understanding of who they're voting for, and what this means.

Equality is key, and without this equality, where would our nation be? By continuing the use of the Electoral College, we have decided to be the best we can be. It says in Source 1, line 1 ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" This provides valid information to support the necessary balance of people and government.

The Electoral College also produces a winner arguably qualified due to the amount of votes received. This is clearly described in Source 3, line 22, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" Due to the use of this process, the election of a President can be efficient and simple. The President can now be Some may argue that this process does not clearly represent the people or their votes. This is because some may vote for a ""slate of electors"" as opposed to the president. However, this belief can be decidedly rejected due to the lack of valid evidence to support the claim. How are voters expected to vote fairly if they are not given the support to do so?

Overall, it can be declared that the Electoral College plays a vital role in maintaining the internal balance of our nation that the citizens inhabiting it are so reliant on. Choosing to reject this process would be deciding to injure our nation, its future, and its people.",0
"I believe that we should get rid of Electoral College because it seems like that it causes more problems then it does with popular vote. So i think that we should use elections to popular vote over electoral voting. For example, the disaster affect which the state legislatures took responsibilty for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Even though that the electoral college has some pros it has more cons.

There are a couple things wrong with the Electoral college. In the electoral college system you dont vote for your president you vote a state of electors who in turn elect the president. If your vote won then the state that you live in would get that amount of electoral votes. For example, if you live in florida and your slate of electors won then your president would get 29 electoral votes. But in there has been a few instances where this system has not worked because of how close the votes were to each other. If there was a tie then it would be sent to the house of representatives where the state delegations vote on the president. This is one of the reasons why I dont like the electoral college because its one big long process when actually it could only take a couple days if we used popular vote instead of electoral college.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It is not fair to lot of people in our country that they have to be put into this long process of determining who our president is going to be when they could just vote and then they'll be done if they use the popular vote system. If we get rid of the electoral college then the popular vote system will be a more quick and efficient way of voting for our president. Also, there will be less tension in our country and less arguments going on.

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Even though there might some reasons why you believe that we should still have the electoral college there are more dangers and risks if we keep the electoral collge. But if we get rid of the electoral college and put in our popular vote system then choosing our president will a lot easier and it will take away controversy in our counrty.",0
"To the State Senate, Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popularbased vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fulfilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, ""...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"" 3. This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place"" Office of the Federal Register, 1. This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well.

According to Plumer, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" 2. This indicates how the tie could carry the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement takes place of voting for the president. Not only this, but Plumer also stated,""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" 2. This statement from Plumer strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House of Representatives would hardly reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gore recieved a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fair? This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumer stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters...swing states..."" 2. This brings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winnertakeall system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance of winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer,2. This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed.

Now, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the ""...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone's President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid RunOff Elections..."" Posner, 3. These subtitles are points that Posner focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winnertakesall method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" 3. In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Runoff Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" 3. I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swingstates are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America.",0
"Nearly everyone in the United States has a car, if they're of age. Many people would probably argue that they need cars. How else would you get somewhere? Well, there are plenty of alternatives to driving, and other ways to just cut back. Limiting car usage has become rather popular recently. Even though there are some disadvantages from limiting car usage, there are so many more advantages that are extremely beneficial.

Pollution has always been a big problem almost everywhere in the world, and cars have a huge influence on it. Pollution can affect people's health and damages the environment. In Paris they put up a partial driving ban to clear up horrible smog. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" Source 2. It only took one day of a driving ban to clear up the smog. Imagine how much less pollution there would be if people limited driving for multiple days, even maybe weeks, or months? It's not like you have to permanently give up driving, just limit it when you can.

Limiting car usage can also help reduce stress levels and make you happier. It might sound crazy at first because, well how would you get places? Wouldn't that cause more stress? Vauban, a city in Germany, is a city that ""forbids"" parking, driveways, and houses with garages. They strategically put stores and buildings within an idealistic walking distance. ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two"" Source 1. If a working mother can do it, so can you. When you're always inside and juggling your kids and their needs, you'll most likely be tense and always feel busy. When you have no other option, besides paying over fourty grand for a space in a parking garage, than to walk somewhere, you'll get to be outside and experience socialization and the fresh air. In my opinion that sounds way better than being confined to a little car when you have to go somewhere.

Obviously there are uncountable benefits that come from limiting car usage. I don't know about you, but honestly I would prefer limited car usage. Until someone takes action to start making it easier to access places we would normally need our car to get to, limiting car usage is not going to be easy.",0
"Ever since their creation, cars have been the main method of transportation. However, in recent times cars have become less popular because of the issues that they cause. Limited car use would be very advantageous because vehicles discourage physical activity, make pollution, and cost everyone money.

An advantage of limiting the use of cars is that they discourage physical activity. Reliance on a motorized vehicle for transportation from place to place results in little to no physical activity. Cars have replaced the use of bicycles, skateboards, and regular walking, their use seemingly reserved only for the youth. In a car free society such as Vaunban, Germany, the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children"" can be heard by anyone walking down the street Source 1. This clearly shows that when cars are used less, people engage in more physical activity. This is the same case for Bogota, Columbia where the Day Without Cars is a big hit. Just in the third year of this event, over 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed in the city Source 3. Limiting the use of cars is definetely advantageous because they discourage physical activity.

Limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make pollution. The billions of vehicles in the world create unbelievable amounts of pollution. In Europe, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions"" and ""up to 50 percent... in the United States"" Source 1. The pollution from the increasing amounts of cars in compacted areas ""are chocking cities"" Source 1. Nearly nothing else creates that much pollution. The only thing that cars are second to in the pollution rates are the monstrous power plants that continuously belch smoke into the atmosphere Source 4. If the use of vehicles decreases, then ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" Source 4. This evidence clearly supports that the use of vehicles is causing a huge amount of pollution. Thus, limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make pollution.

Decreased use of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because the they cost everyone money. Expenses such as constant maintanance and fuel cost the average car owner a large chunk of their salary. In April 2013, the average miles driven per person was down by 9 percent, equivalent to the rate in January 1995 Source 4. The most likely cause is that ""cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars"" Source 4. The high cost of cars and their maintanace is a huge burden on the backs of the average vehicle owner. Not only does vehicles cost the individual person, but they have large effects on the government. In the sixyear federal transportation bill, the cost of the highways was 80 percent, and only 20 percent was available to all other forms of transportation Source 1. This issue has caused the legislators to get involved with the problem. Obviously, decreasing the amount of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because they cost everyone money.

Limited car use would be very advantageous because vehicles discourage physical activity, make pollution, and cost everyone money.",0
"Imagine a life without cars. All those paved roads completely empty with no traffic and no honking horns. Sounds like a peaceful community to me. Limiting cars could be a huge advantage to our world. Reducing these big pieces of metal flying all over our roads could help our environment, save tons of money, and improve our safety.

Recently, I've heard about all the well known car dealers pushing hybrid cars and trying to design a environment friendly vehicle. But in reality, the only big step to helping our planet is to reduce cars overall. Studies shown that green house gases are ""... up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"". Not only is the green house gas rate going up, but pollution, carbon emissions, and smog are as well. In Paris, France they had to ban driving for a couple of days as the pollution produced smog. ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London..."". The numbers keep rising in Europe and the USA. Picture what our environment is going to be like in 20 years if we keep this pace up. Without these machines we could reduce the number of micrograms, produce the harmful gases from affecting the environment, and stop polluting the air we breathe.

Everyone likes to save money, whether it's with coupons or getting the best prices possible. So how would you feel if you had the ability to save thousands of dollars a year? With reducing cars, you can save your money by public transportation, not paying for a car insurance, and not paying for a car in general. Not getting a car may seem strange as you need to get to location A and B. But in Vauban, Germany cars are not allowed and they seem to be doing just fine. Reports say ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life"". Even though they aren't aloud personal cars, they can walk, bike, or take a tram anywhere they need to go! Also in most parts of America they now have carpooling apps, public transportation, and shared vans! So instead of paying huge amounts of money for gas, a car, and car insurance, why not just tag along for a ride or get some excersize!

As you watch somebody drive off, dont you worry about their safety? Every year there are more percentages of deaths and injuries in cars then there is in any other motor accident. We can prevent drunk driving, car crashes, and the amount of injures and deaths by reducing cars. I hate hearing those unbearable stories about teenagers getting behind the wheel under the influence causing crazy car wrecks. To avoid that we can allow public transportation, removing any crashes and improving the safety of our generation. Also, the traffic jams that make people stressful and angry increase the crash rates as aggresive driving is very dangerous. To prevent that we can just walk, allowing us to enjoy our clean air and get excersize.

In conclusion, cars have changed our way of life for the good and the bad. Even though they help us get to our destination, they affect our environment, our money, and our safety. If we reduce the amount of cars driven we can help our environment by lowering the rate of greenhouse gases, pollution, and carbon emissions. Also we save tons of money as we dont spend thousands of dollars on cars, and their needs. And finally, reducing cars saves tons of lifes as drunk driving and car crashes are avoided allowing the death and injury rates to decrease. So next time you're walking down the street, think about how your community would be without these machines.",0
"Many countries and places are starting to reduce their usage of cars. In multiple places they are to considered ""carfree"" or they have ensued partial car bans, even going as far as setting a specific day to ""Carfree Day"". The issues in most of these places is the reduction of the smog that is thought to be produced by diesel vehicle. The fights against pollution are really starting to take effect in a multitude of places, such as, Vauban, Germany. Paris, France and bogota, Colombia. And their efforts against pollution is really starting to take ahold and become popular.

In Vauban, Germany The people of this high class community have completely given up their vehicle. In Vauban, street parking and other car related items are forbidden in the ""experimental new district"". The main thoroughfare however, is one of the few places on the edge of the city where car ownership is allowed. But, there are only ever two places to park. A large set of garages at the very edge of the development. Where said car owner would be required to but a space and a home for 40,000. Just for a parking lot.

Resulting factors from this CarFree suburban, people seem to be happier without their vehicle. vaughn's residents seem to rather enjoy ""the swish of bicycle tires, the chatter and laugter of the wandering children, drown out the occasional distant motor."" Vauban is to be considered a main component of a movement called ""smart planning"". When finished in 2006 57 percent of it's residents sold their vehicle to move into the residence.

Germany's efforts in the past two decades have never been as successful as Vauban has been. With its 5,500 residents withing a rectangualr square mile, it is considered to be on of the most advanced experiments in lowcarcarless suburban life. Germany has been attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transport. Whether it be bikes, walking, skates or some form of physical transport. Near by these carless suburbs, they place stores along a main street near the suburb and not in some mall miles away on a interstatehighway.

Even though Germany is trying to create a utopia of carless suburbs there are still places that still thrive on the dream of large New Yorkian style suburbs, private garages and spread out homes. These were the deam towns of the 1950's. Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vaubanlike.

In Paris, France Paris enforced a partial driving ban on it's residents to help clear out the choking smog, which is rival to that of Beijing, China. Paris officials ordered motorists with evennumbered license plates to keep their cars at home or they will be fined 22 euros or 31 in American currency. The same ensued for those with oddnumbered plates the next day.

Due to this ban and fine on automobiles, almost 4,000 people had their cars impounded due to their reactions to getting a fine. Granted in the same token street congestion was down nearly 60% in France's capital. France, and Paris officials blammed diesel vehicle for their abundance of smog, although there is a tax that favors diesal gas instead of regular gasoline. So in turn to this gas tax, diesal made up 67% of all vehicle in France.

Unfortunately due to the high percentage of diesal vehicle the Paris has more smog that any other European capital. Although this ban did have a few consiquences, delivery companies complained of lost revenue. While people with plugin cars, hybrids, and cares carrying three or more passangers. People found that public transit was completely free of charge during the experimental period of this car ban. The smog thankfully cleared just enough that the ruling French party to rescind the car ban for oddnumbered plates a few days later.

In bogota Colombia Colombian officials set to spread a program across to ohther countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, skated, biked, and or took buses to work durring carfree day. For a period of three years Colombia has dedicated one day to carfree day, all violators would be fined 25. In a city of 7 million. The goal is to reduce and promote alternative tranportations to and from work, school, home, and to reduce smog levels umungst the city.

Despite the heavy rains and grey skies, the turnout was more than expeced. And for the first time, two other Colombian cities joined into the event, spreading it further than ever. Officials from other countries came to bogota to see the carfree event and were exstatic. Claming that the people of Colombia were generating a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders.

This day has been a work in progress ever since the mid 1990's. bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. The most any Latin American city has ever seen in years past. An abundance of parks and sports centers have popped up, sidewalks that were small, worn and pitted have been completely replaced with smooth broad sidewalks and paths. Even new upscale dining and shopping districts have popped up due to this carfree day.

Goals set by President Obama are seemingly being unveiled as time passes due to studies suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars, and all together driving less and less as time passes by. With the United States being one of the worlds largest car capitals, it seems that love for cars is dwindleing with efforts to keep down pollution and smog levels.

The most accurate assumption today as to why the US's love and total buying of cars has dwindled so drastically is due to the recession that we had experienced. Cashstapped Americans couldnt afford to buy new vehicle and that seems to be a persistant happening as the years pass. Unfortunately major car companies are starting to suffer due to this fall of people indulging in a car purchase.

Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to ""rebrand"" themselves as mobility companies and reorganising their product with wider varieties. Not only has car buying dropped, so has the rate of people between the ages of 1639 getting a license. Most people are turning to carpooling, walking or public transportation to get to their jobs, or other places, so in turn, getting a license is in not in the forefront of their mind.

Many countries are getting on the bandwaggon of fighting against pollution, ensueing laws against driving all together, creating temporaty or partial bans. And they see a difference in their smog, pollution levels. These peoplecountries are taking the innitiative to take care of the major underlying problems to much bigger problems such as global warming and problems of that nature. There are changes happening, and these changes are benefiting everyone.",0
"Dear senator, the Electoral College has always been a good way to elect our leaders, and it is the best way to do it. It has the ability to use swing states for better voting, larger and smaller states get different amounts of electoral votes, and presidents cannot be elected by a region alone.

The effect of having swing states because of the Electoral College is a positive one because when a state feels like they have a chance of having their candidate win, they put more thought into the vote they cast knowing that their vote counts. Having voters put more thought into their votes instead of not caring as much gives the better candidate a greater chance of winning, if one candidate was truly better than the other. The more thoughtfull candidates in a swing state will pull more information from the candidates campaigns. Popular vote does not use the winner takes all method so the idea of swing states will no longer have any effect in the election.

Another great reason why the Electoral College is better than popular vote is because depending on the size of the states a certain amount of votes is given to the electors. Larger states get more attention from presidential candidates because of the majority vote in the particular state. if there was only popular vote then presidential candidates could waste their time on smaller states when they could of been winning larger states. The varying amount of electoral votes for each state depending on its size also allows for a more equal and fair election, due to the less populated states not being able to have more electoral votes then the more populated states.

The Electoral College allows that presidential candidates cannot win the election by regional appeal. This means that if a particular region favors a candidate they cannot win by only a single regions votes. This makes the candidates campaign less in regions that are more likely to be won and more in other regions. But with the Electoral College this makes it harder for a candidate with only regional appeal to win because other regions feel like their votes will not be as effective towards the election. With popular vote a presidential candidate will not know where to campaign and where not because there is no winner take all method.

This is why I belive that having the Electoral College is superior to popular vote when we the people vote for presidential candidates.",0
"The Electoral College is an outdated system of voting. There are few weak reasons why it should be carried out as the nations voting process. The United States of America should change to election by popular vote for the presidency.

Admmitedely, the winner take all system is a fair way of deciding the votes. In the first article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, ""Most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate."" If a presidential candidate spends lot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a ""swing"" state he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a ""winnertakeall"" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, ""Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for. However the people should have the right to directly choose the candidate of his or her choice. Therefore, the electoral college is outdated and must be eliminated.

To start off, Bradford Plumer the author of ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Every vote counts. But why make a vote more powerful than another. Citizens shouldn't be given a special vote just because they were chosen by the candidates party. Additionally, Plumer explains, ""If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" Why should kerry earn 34 electoral votes. He should earn the amount of voters in that state he persuaded to vote for him. He should not earn the electoral votes of all the people that did not think he was the best presidential candidate. Every vote should count, and that is why the electoral college should be eliminated.

Secondly, Plumer claims ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The senate would choose the vicepresident. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represnt 35million voters."" This method is rediculous. A state with one representative should not have the equal amount of power as a state with 55. If popular vote is made the way of electing then the odds of a tie would be nearly impossible. Also Plumer adds, ""Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This means more people thought he was better suited to be the President of the United States, but Bush won because of the ""quirks"" of the electoral college. All in all, the electoral college is unfair, and creates more problems then popular vote.

The United States of america should change from the electoral college to popular vote. The outcome would be better for the country, and fairer to the candidates. That is why the electoral college should be eliminated.",0
"In the world we live in today, cars are used by people nearly everyday. To some they are looked at as a need such as water, food, or shelter rather something we want to improve our life. Although, it may improve our lives in the particular moment to some degree, we fail to see the greater and more longterm effects from everyday car usage. The following sources reviews these effects and reveals the problems and solutions we may have to fix them.

One of the more serious and more recognized problems from car usage is the steady increase of greenhouse gas emissions produced from vehicles all over the world. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Vauban, Germany is an example of the effort being made to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions, this experimental city is trying to remain ""carfree"" and in doing so the city itself has to make its own changes. This basic precept is being adopted around the world by trying to compact suburbs and make them more accessible by public transportation.""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said by heidrun waltersource 1. With this new experiment, people are finding ways to adapt and live the changed life while others actually feel better off.

Another serious and impacting issue from car usage is the increase in smog over big named cities. In paris, after days of a near record breaking pollution, paris bans driving throughout the city in attempt to clear up the skies. Diesel fuel is looked at as main problem paris faced in cleaning out the intensifying smog, since a france tax act favors diesel over gasoline it displays an issue the france government must correct in their own wrong doings. A different look towards car usage is that recent studies show americans buying fewer cars, getting fewer and fewer licenses, and also driving less overall. If this pattern continues there will be positive reinforcements for carbon emissions and the environment, since its the and largest emission producer in America. The internet brings a whole other chess piece to the game allowing kids to feel more connected with people without driving anywhere. ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" said by Bill Ford executive chairman of the Ford Motor Companysource 4.

A program set up in bogota, colombia is a program developed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" said businessman carlos arturosource 3. Sports centers and parks have also increased throughout the citybad conditioned sidewalks have been replaced with smooth onesrush hour restictions have been cut largely and high class shopping districts have also been created. This program is already looked at by many countries and is being observed by the world like an exciting experiment.

There are many advantages to limiting car use and these are just few of them. Overall, the advantages observed are just from the few examples of less car use that we have, if more people look towards this problem of over used cars.",0
"When electing the president of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolar College to decide. The electoral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president give their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president. Many people dislike this system including myself. I disaprove of this system because it limits representation, permits the disinterest of voters, and reduces a candidates interest in a state.

One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people. The Electoral COllege votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states receives. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only receives one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have acurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes. There have also been times in which a president has won the piopular vote but lost the Electoral College vote. This was seen in the 2000 vote of Bush versus Gore when Gore won the popular vote and Bush won the electoral vote.

One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair. However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority. In some states, there is a large majority of people running for a single party. This can be observed primarily in Texas where an overwhelming majority of voters are Republican. Therefore, the Republican president wins Texas almost every election period. This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly good to express as an American trait.

As stated before, the larger the population of a states, the more Electoral College votes that state gets. This leads to a small group of ""big states"" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most of the other 50 states have a smaller amount of votes and are less of an objective for candidates to acquire. In many states throughout an election preiod the period in which candidates move to diferent states giving speeches the candidates never make an appearance in their state at all. This is observed in the 2000 election in which seventeen states did not have the candidate make an appearance at all. This also can lower interest in voting for the president.

The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes. Moving to popular vote will fix all of these problems and will improve the way we vote for our president.",0
"Dear Senator, Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" Posner Though the lack of control over the president of the United states election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of backup to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, heshe votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winnertakeall"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts hisher vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from hisher presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spoton. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society heshe lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for hisher representatives pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of malapportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and coordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.",0
"Sometimes you don't need a car to go some place, you have choices like take the bus, or use your bike, but sometimes you need a car to go some place far away. I will discuss about the advantages of limiting car usage. I feel that the cars are important but we can live without the because we have others sources to transported and don't expent to much money.

First of all, commercial and public transportation are woven through a connection of network to save time, to conserve resources, lower emissions and to improve safety. Theres a lot of accidents that people commit because a car, sometimes they are tired and don't pay attention to the road, they get distracted by something, and sometimes theres no parking lad for a car. A car is a responsibility. When you have a car you can get tense because, you have to expent you money filling the tank of gas, and repair something if is broken, but sometimes you don't have the money for do that and you take the bus or the subway because is less expensive. People have their cars impounded fot their reaction to the fine, cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. people sometimes said that they can't live without a car, if you get to think, they're sometime wrong because there's many public transportation.

In addition, if people don't have a car it would be a impact to people because everybody would be on the streets, and everything would be full of people, but without a car we can get to safe more the atmosphere. Sometimes we have carfree days to save the environment of our world, it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution and the turnout was large. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign. parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, pitted sidewalks have beed replaced bye broas, smooth sidewalks, arushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The united states, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car culture. With all these canges, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recessin may find less reasons to resume the habit.

In Conclusion, have a car it's a responsibility that people have to have, we don't need a car sometimes, but sometimes we do. I feel that the cars are importants, its fine that we get to save the environment but without a car we don't get to go to place we want to go everytime we want.",0
"Car alarms, car horns, and engines are basically the only thing people hear nowadays. The number of cars in the streets are simply beginning to get out of hand.

Citizens all around the world, we all should really try to limit the amount of time that we are spending using our vehicle.

If you really take a moment to think about it, this could honestly turn out to be a really good thing.

Cars are not necessarily a need, they are a want. I can undertand if you are going to be traveling a far distance that two feet cant get you, but certianlty and ten minute walk to the grocery storemarket cant hurt.

Limiting car usage is very important. Most families tend to spend about about 2050.00 on gas a week. One advantage to limiting car usage is saving a ton of money on gas that could easily be spent of food, to feed your family.

"" "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" "" People who have decided to limit the amount of time they spent using their car, are much happier.

One advantage to limiting the use of cars is that the air would become much more fresh and clean, and it would become alot more healthier for us citizens.

"" "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseated bicycle with his wife."" "" Most people that have decided to stop using cars or have significantly limited their car usage, have nothing but positive things to say.

If more people became aware that not spending so much time driving was a good thing, and simply limited their care usage, the air would become so much more clean, and alot more of us would be happy.

A former citizen has shared with us that one advantage to limiting car usage for her is that her children have ""... organized their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car pool with friends."" She has also mentioned that her children were not in any rush to get their drivers license, even though where they live a car would would definetely ""...come in handy."" Most people have really been able to enjoy walking and not using their cars.

Driving your car is not intirely a bad thing, but simply limiting your car usage is a wonderfull thing, and many advantages come to limitng car usage. You save a great deal of money on gas when you decide to walk rather than to drive, the air become a lot more clean and heathy for our lungs, and many people are able to focus more on the important things in life, like jobs and friends and family.

If you decide to park your car in the garage and put away the keys, you'd really be able to see how nice it is to just walk to your destination rather than drive, it's a great way to realx and to just enjoy yourself.",0
"Dear Senator, I am a student writing to you that we should be changing the Electoral College, to the election by popular vote. If you change the voting system to the election by popular vote, then people are able to vote for who they want to vote, rather than having someone for president as a mistake during the voting. I believe that people should have the right to vote based on the president, not the slate of electors. Also because of the ""disaster factor,"" and because of the ""winnertakeall"" system.

First off, you should change the system to the election by popular vote, because people should be able to vote based on the president and not the slate of electors. It is not fair that the people who pick the electors are people from the states convention, party's central committee or the candidates themselves. The voters should be allowed to control who their electors vote for. Since they are part of the country, they should have a say in the country too. We should not be confused about the voting for the ""wrong"" electors, but be able to know what we are doing.

Secondly, may I recall the ""disaster factor,"" the biggest crisis the century? The Louisiana legislature back in the 1960's, they had some trouble in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors. In fact, they almost did not succeed in doing this. The state's legislatures are probably the ones who are responsible for this incident, because of picking the electors themselves. By keeping the electoral college, you could probably make the same mistakes again.

Lastly, another reason why we should change the voting system to the election by popular vote is, because of the ""winnertakeall"" system. Candidates running for president know they have no chance in winning, if they spend their time in the wrong states. So instead they spend all their time in states are probably going to vote for them.

All in all, we should not be keeping the electoral college, because its unfair to voters who don't know the real reason why they voted for a candidate, people also do not want to make the mistakes they made in the past, and the ""winnertakeall"" system is just irrational.",0
"The electoral college is a bad thing because voters aren't voting directly for the candidates. Voters are only voting for a slate of electors that then vote for a president. Uninformed people might be mislead as to what they are actually voting for. The election should be changed to popular vote because the electoral college is not voting directly on a matter.

While big states have more say in what happens, small states were created to have just as much power. There are few states with over twenty electoral votes, and twenty votes is a lot. But, there are far more small statesin terms of population than big states. Having many states with only 716 beats few big states with 2055. Some candidates won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote due to what states they were popular in. This sways the actual results of voting and messes up what should be based on raw voting numbers. Having electors making the desision for the state is another reason why certain candidates lose.

Some people in America don't know the difference between the popular vote and electoral vote. This can result in people being mislead. If a candidate were to visit California and make a good impression, that state would have a higher chance of being in that candidates favor. If another candidate were to go to Montana, make a good impression just like the first one, he would have the advantage for that state. Both candidates put in the same effort, but the first one would have many more electoral votes than the second mainly because of how electoral votes work.

The winner takes all rule is also in some way bad. Candidates would be competing over larger states like California and New York, If the voting within that state came down to a 49 to 51 percent vote, one candidate would be so close but acheive absoloutly nothing. Each candidate SHOULD get whatever votes they earned to make the voting the way it should be and more fair.

The electoral college is in many ways imperfect, which is why popular vote would be more efficient and more of an actual competition. Popular vote is also a way to make voting simple.",0
"In the recent years the state of the country has been a major issue. The environment is a growing concern and the economic condition of the citizens is a pressing matter. One way the alleviate the stress on these factors is to limit car use. Doing so will help the environment by limiting greenhouse incisions, and not having a car all together or limiting car use will save money for those who are economicly weak. Limited car use would alleviate all these problems.

The environment houses us along with everything that supplies us with the means to live. In recent years that has been under attack by pollution. according to Robert Duffer one of the major issues of Paris, France is the increasing smog and pollution that has decended upon the city. The level of pollution rivaled the most polluted cities in the world: Beijing China. In order to combat the smog French officials have placed a ban on drving, and for those that chose to disobey recived a fine. The smog then cleared up to allow the ruling French party to rescind the ban. This should be an example for highly poluted areas everywhere. Not only does this preserves the environment but it also takes the health and well being of citizens into account.

The limited use of cars would help those who are finacialy weak to strengthen themselves, because not having to use money to pay for the expenses of a car would leave you money to take care of other necessities. Elisabeth Rosenthal wrote that in some German suburbs there is 70% of the people residing there that do not have cars. And there is only a few places where they can be parked, and for the places that allow parked must be purchased for 40,000 dollars, along with a house. Just not having a car itself would be much more affordable! 57% of the people who live in that suburban area sold their cars to move there. As shown by Rosenthal's report, not having a car would prove to be more economicaly sound and benifital especially to those who are struggling.

There are many advantages to the limiting of the usage of cars. For one thing it aids the environment by adding less pollutants into the air, which harm the environment and the people in it. Also people that use their cars less save money, which would benifit those whoa rent in the best possible economic situation. Many say that limiting the use of acars would prevent many from going to work, school and other obligagtions, but there are other means of transportaion including bikes, buses, subways and monorails. Think of the disadvantages to excessive car use, high pollution, expensive expenses such as gasoline and maintence of the car. Limited car use would remove all these burdens.",0
"Dear Senator, The Electoral College was created many, many years ago in the Constitution by our founding fathers, and now it is finally its time to retire. The Electoral College should be taken away and replaced by election by popular vote, in order to determine the president of the United States. The Electoral college should be abolished, because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are not treated fairly in this process. The United States strives to be a place of freedom and equality, but we as a country can not achieve this goals with this process in place.

The United States of America, is all about people protecting their rights, but how can that be if citizens are not even allowed to represent themselves with their own votes. According to the Office of the Federal Register's article,""What is the Electoral College?,""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" Which means that our votes just choose people to represent our state and vote for us. So whats the whole point of voting in the first place? Is it just to make citizens feel like they are actually choosing the president. This process would not be a problem if the electors actually represented us correctly. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer, ""in 2000...Al Gore... won the popular vote but lost the presidency,"" because of the electoral college. Plumer went on to quote a Gallop poll recorded after Al Gore lost which reported,"" over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to kind we have now."" Thats over half of the people voting! But the incident with Al Gore was not the only one, also according to Bradford Plumer's article,"" in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" In other words, they were trying to cheat and make sure the out come of the vote was what they wanted. People may argue that there have only been few instances of the Electoral College making mistakes, but how many more mistakes are they going to make in the future. Will there be so many, that our entire political system becomes corrupt. The citizens of the United States should be allowed to represent themselves with their own vote, and choose their own leaders.

How can the U.S. strive for equality, if states are not treated fairly through the process of the electoral college? The Electoral College process, is a winnertakesall system, because of this, candidates spend their time only focused on specific states. States that are most populated, or that they think will be a ""swing"" state, basically any state that has a specific insterest to them and that will help their campaign. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" written by Bradford Plumer,""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This is a result of the faulty system, how are people suppossed to know who they want to vote for, if candidates won't even take the time to make a pitch to them? If the United States really wants equality, they need to start by having a equal state voting process.

At the end of it all, the Electoral College should be abolished because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are treated unfairly in the process. Help the United States continue to reach its goal of freedom and equality by abolishing the Electoral College.

Sincerely, United States Citizen.",0
"As our atmosphere constantly changes, so do our habits. With greenhouse emissions rising, our efforts towards changing it are too. Even outside of the United States there are efforts being made in Germany, France, and Colombia. In Gernamy, some people have ended up selling their cars, and started living a whole new lifestyle. Moved into carless communities with others, and now live supposedly happier lives. A city in Columbia, officially has a car free day, to try and cut down on emissions and help reduce the stress of driving, also those who do not go along with it are fined. So, maybe life with less cars can actually be beneficial to many of us.

In the city of Vauban, Germany there is a suburb that was finished around 2006. Its goal was to limit the use of cars. So far it seems successful in its purpose where 70% of the families living there do not have cars, and at least 57% sold a car to live in that suburb. For the most part, there is no driveways, garages, or street parking so it is mainly carfree except for the ""main thoroughfare"" being the tram to downtown. Proof that not only the idea was beneficial, but it was also ""inspirational"" is that places like Vauban, are growing more and more in Europe, and the U.S. has the EPA environmental Protection Agency promoting these car reduced communities, and legislators are now starting to act upon it. It is also becoming a part of a movement called ""smart planning"". The idea also is to make cities denser so more people can live, and easier for walking. To make things closer, so getting there is not such a hassle especially if you don't have a car.

After nearrecord pollution in Paris, the city enforced a partial ban on car use to help clear the city's air. On Monday, morotorists with an even numbered plate were told to leave their car come, or be fined. and on that Tuesday, people with odd numbered plates would have to do the same. Because of that, nearly 4,000 people were fined. And 27 people had their cars impounded due to the way they acted upon being fined. Though it left some unhappy people, it did help the congestion was down by 30% in the city.

The City of Bogota, Colombia has started a carfree day. And apparently it's a big hit. Its goal is to promote alternate transportation, and reduce smog, with the exception of buses and taxis. That day, millions of Colombians either walked, hiked, biked, or skated. And even though there was some gray clouds with a bit of rain, it didn't stop many people. It is also seen as an opportunity to help lower stress and air pollution. And to show its popularity, two other cities in the county Cali and Velledupar have joined in on the event. Even the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay came to the county to say how great of an idea it was. More parks, sports centers have been buit, and 118 miles of bike paths have been created. On top of that, new sidewalks have been built to help people in general.

With all of the effort that so many countries have put out towards making a better environment for themselves, I hope you would be able to see why they did it, because I do. When it comes to making communities with car restrictions, or a day or two when use in limited it all helps. So Maybe I could convince you to reduce your car use, and improve your life.",0
"Dear Mr. State Senator, I am writing this letter to talk about how the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. First, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Second, there could be a tie in the electorsal vote. Last, the voters are merely voting for the slate of electorss rather than the president. Those are my points on why to take away the Electoral College.

To start this off the Electoral College is unfair to the voters. Because of the ""winnertakeall system in each state"", the candidates don't take time to go to other states that they know they will lose, they only really focus on the ""swing"" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen statesdidn't see the candidates in their state at all, also 25 of the largest media markets had not seen a single campaign ad from a candidate. Also it's unfair because voters don't really know who to vote for because they see no campaign ads and candidates don't show up to their state and tell them what heshe is running for. That's why the Electoral College is unfair to voters of the presidential election.

Second, there could be a tie in the electorsal vote. In the case of the tie it would go straight to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote for the president. By this the House's decision is no where close to that of the people in their state. The election is omly a few swing voters away from catastrophe. That's why it is bad if the vote ends in a tie.

Lastly, the voters are merely voting for the slate of electorss rather than the president. For instance, if you ""lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electorss pledged to Kerry."" The worst part is that the electorss could be anyone you don't even have to hold a political position to be an electors, they could be very biased and narrowminded. That's why the Electoral College is unfair.

In conclusion Mr. Senator the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational because it is unfair to voters, there could be a tie in the electorsal vote and the voters are merely voting for a slate of electorss and not there president. So Mr.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. It is better for the environment, it limits time spent sitting in traffic, and saves money.

The main cause of people wanting to limit driving is to protect the environment. According to an article by Elizabeth Rosenthal, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gasses in Europe... and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Emissions from car exhaust is polluting the air and creating smog in large cities. According to Robert Duffer, Paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog. Some people want new suburbs to be built specifically to encourage the limiting of driving. Limiting driving does lower the amount of smog and air pollution in cities.

Another benefit of limiting driving is that it limits time spent sitting in traffic. In Bogota, Colombia, a ""carfree day"" was issued. The goal was to reduce smog as well as reduce traffic jams around the city. The reduction of these traffic jams also reduced stress and promoted excessive. People could stop worrying about being late for work because of the traffic. It caused many people to walk or bike to work instead of driving or taking the bus. Another advantage of this is that parks and sports centers have thrived across Bogota. Limiting the use of cars isn't only healthier for the environment but also for us.

One final advantage to limiting the use of cars is that it saves money. Citizens save money by not having to buy cars or the gas they require. Also, citizens don't have to pay taxes for roads, parking lots, or traffic lights. Another way limiting driving saves money is on the materials and equipment needed to pave roads and parking lots. Since many people who live in dense cities take the subway or bus to work anyway because of the recent recession, limiting car use would be an easy way to clean up some pollution in that city.

In conclusion, limiting driving has many big advantages. It protects the environment while limiting traffic in cities, encouraging excessive, and saving money. I'm not sure how it would work out here because of how spread out everything is, but it sounds like a great idea in a dense city.",0
"In the United States of America, and all over the world, cars are used every day. People use them to get to work, to go see family, and to get simply, from A to B, but a new idea is sprouting up in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere where people are doing something unheard of.... giving up their cars. According to Source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", Vauban, Germany is a city that is almost completely car free. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" THis shows that living without cars is not only possible, but could have some great consequences.

Living car free could seem like something impossible, but it has great effects. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a study revealing that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe....and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Without cars, we could lower pollution, which is a huge problem for some places. In the second article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris has to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city after days of nearrecord pollution. Motorist with even number licence plates were ordered to leave their cars on day and motorists with odd numbered plates were ordered to the next day. This enforcement had positive consequences along with it. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital and the smog hanging over the city eventually cleared. This shows almost immediate benefits to the decline in driving. Can you imagine the benefits after a long term period of carfree cities? The possibilities are limitless.

Carfree periods of time don't have to be long term. In Bogota, Colombia, a carfree day takes place every year and it is a ""big hit"" with millions of Colombians according to the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". For the third straight year, cars have been banned only excluding busses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog in the city of 7 million. Anyone who violated the rules were fined 25 dollars. For the first time ever, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined in the event. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This should show that car free periods of time are possible, not matter how long, and that they have great consequences that come along with them.

You might say that it would be extremely difficult to make America a car free country. Well, according to a report in the fourth article ""The End of Car Culture"" America may be on it's way. Research studues show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The nummber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter according to a analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. Thsi shows that there is a steady decline in driving and autiomotive transport in America. Also found in the fourth article, if the pattern persists, it will have beneficial impliactions for carbon emissions and the enviorment. Many sociologists believe the pattern will continue. Alternate sources of transportation have popped up also. In New York, a new bike sharing program has popped up and in San Fransisco, Bay Arear Rapid Transit is another viable option of transport. With all of these options, doesn't one fit you?

In conclusion, alternate transport oppurtunities and car free periods of time are the solution. With so many ways to lower how much and how you drive. The switch to a more economic means of transport would be easier than you think. The possibilities are endless and multiple studies show that the good consequences outweigh the bad ones.",0
"Dear Senator Adams, Voting for a president is not what it seems to be. The electoral college makes the people's votes so that the electors are actually voted. These electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. The popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.

To begin with, Electors that are voted for by the people are not always trustworthy. They're hand picked by their political party but sometimes,""state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...""Does The Electoral. Voters can't control who their electors vote for president. The electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, ""the electors could always defy the will of people""The Indefensible Electoral. This is unreliable and the way of voting by the people can be easily swayed by the electors.

Additionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. This situation has happened when,""Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes""In Defense Of. Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. The electoral college is unstable and this major downside is a factor.

More over, many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In this article it states that, ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate""The Indefensible Electoral. The electoral college does not clarify to voters on what the people are actually voting for. In another article it explains that people actually voted for a slate of electors. This would mean that the author had to reassure the right understanding. Readers of that article who've voted are now in disbelief or shocked.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be addressed to a win by popularity. The electors in favor of their political party are not always trustworthy. The popularity winner can lose due to lack in electoral votes. Also, many voters are confused or don't know how the electoral college works in presidential elections. These facts add on to more cons than pros of the idea of electoral college.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, As you are most likely aware, the Electoral College is a longdebated, controversial process. I believe that it is in the best interest for the citizens of America that the Electoral College be abolished. Under the Electoral College system, voters do not vote for the president but rather for a slate of electorss who will vote for the president. Voters cannot control who the electorss vote for and it is not unheard of that any given electors may be ""faithless"" and refuse to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast their deciding vote for whomever they want. The people of the United States of America are speaking up. According to a gallop poll conducted shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency in 2000, over 60% a majority of voters prefer to have a direct election over an election through the Electoral College.

Bush Vs. Kerry election is rare, but nevertheless, it happened, are we going to wait until it happens again to make a change? We take pride in being a democracy, we take pride in living in such a place that was created by the people and for the people , but is the power really in the hands of the people? The power may be in the hands of the people, but only the 538 people who belong to the Electoral College. The system in place is flawed and the outcome can be manipulated to favor one political party over the other. In 1960, segregationists in Louisiana nearly successfully replaced the Democratic electorss with different electorss who would deceive the voters and then oppose Kennedy when voting.

Another con of The Electoral College is a dilemma that has to do with the number of electorsal votes given to each state. The Electoral College works in the same way that The House of Representatives does. The number of electorss alloted to each state is subjective to the population number of that state. Take a state such as California for example. California is alloted 55 electorss. States such as South Dakota and Alaska cant compete with the great power coming from the larger states. In the Congress, the Senate was created to balance it out, but there is nothing in place to balance the importance between large high density states and small low density states. Even more worrying is the situation in which there is a tie. In the case of a tie in the electorsal college, the election would be given to the House of Representatives, where state delegations would then have the deciding vote.

The Electoral College is outdated, unfair and impractical. The citizens of The United States are more than capable of making descisions for themselves and do not need electorss to make it for them. It is a nondemocratic method of selecting a president and should be abolished.

Thank You.",0
"""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""1 This process where a selection of electors meet and vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes in Congress is a way of election that has been in the roots of this great and prosperous country since its beginning. Is this way of electing really all that fair? Does it let the entire population get a fair say in who thay want to run the country? While some people may argue that this system allows the people on the commity of electors that actually want to have their fair say in who becomes president, but first you need to think about they whole american population barely has any say at all in the election and we change this tradition.

It is time for a change, because when a United States citizen votes, they actually arent even voting for president at all. They are mearly voting for a commity of electors to elect the next president for them. Also, is the the commity of electors that actaully wins the elections, and not the popular vote. This is why they call this commity of electors the swing vote because you could win the popular vote by 78.9 percent and still lose the election because you lost the commity of electors votes. This senerio has happened a few times in our history. For instance in 2000 candidate Al Gore won there popluar vote but lost the presidency thanks to the commity of electons from the electoral college. Some people may argue that this is a long tradtion in our country and must be kept. Yes this is true, but there are some very crusial factors against this.

I understand that this election process was put forth but our founding father and some people do not want to just throw it away. While I understand this however, there are flaws in this process that must not be over looked. It does not include and take into count the whole population and it can lead some canadits to lose even when the whole country voted for them. So we need to do something about this process of election. We must find a new way that included and takes into count the population of the United States. Not just a commity of electors.

The Elector College has been is the building blocks of this country since its beginning, but because of some of it's flaws it must be changed. This process does not include the entire count of the votes by american citizens. It is like our thoughts and ideas of who should be president do not even matter in the votting process. The Electoral College may be a deep tradition in our country since its beginning, it must be changed if our great nation is going to be able to prosper and grow.",0
"Dear State Senator, I believe that something should be brought to your attention. I'm concerned about the way we are handling the current election process of presidency. You see, at the moment weus Americansuse the Electoral College. But it is becoming a major issue. I understand that ""the founding fathers established it in the Constitution."" But ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors."" Why focus all of our time choosing Electors, when we could be allowing citizens to vote directly for their President themselves. Office of the Federal Register states,""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors."" Did you realize that ""a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President""? We have millions of people in our country that could be doing the work themselves.

I understand that life is not always fair, but I do believe that as a State Senator you could use a hand. ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" They could use a helping hand as well! ""The presidential election is held every four years."" In those four years, American citizens wait eagerly and anxiously to choose a potential new president. Why don't we give the people what they want? ""Most states have a winnertakesall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation.'"" These complications could be avoided if we listened to what the citizens have to say and allowed them the freedom to vote for their president directly. America is the land of freedom after all, is it not Senator?

""According to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" A recent article by Bradford Plumer says,""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.",0
"As one of the people living in Florida I am honor to have the opportunity to write you this letter telling you about what I think about keeping the Electoral collegee. For numerous reasons I think we have a better outcome of getting the candidate we want if we keep the Electoral collegee method to vote for our candidates.Does reasons are : certainty of outcome, Everyone's president, and swing states.

Problems over Electoral collegee is possible but not as much as problems over popular vote. ""The reason is that winning candidate's share of the winning candidate's share of the Electoral college invariably exceeds his share of popular vote"".This also benefits small states. In addition the is a possibility to have a tie in nationwide electoral vote "" because the total number of votes538is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.."" Everyone's president The candidate have to be neutral, it cannot have favorite religion or section of the country because ""The residents of the other regions ae likely to feel disenfranchisedto feel that their votes do not count,that the new president will have no regard for their interests,that he really isn't their president"".

candidates most of the time choose to focused more on the tossup states because they are ""the most thoughtful voters and should be the ones to decide the election"".

""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"".People are worried that the government will choose for them. They do not realise that if we don't have the electoral college than that is is more than likely to happen because the electoral college is what allows us to have a voice, a say, in what we want in our future president.

Keeping the electoral colloge gives the peope the opportunity to choose wisely who they want taking care of them for the next four years.",0
"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced delegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definite winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winnertakeall"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the candidates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swinglike tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.",0
"""With less cars we have less accidents and less problems "". As a teenager i should be getting prepare to get my learner license but i do not bother because thats not my priority that doesn't mean i'm not interesting in driving but everything i need are close by like the mall , restaurants and a lot of other thing so i dont really see the need to be driving. By limiting our car usage we prevent accident and we payless bill such as car insurance and gas money.

""After a day of nearrecord pollution , Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city "". Every country should have more than one day where we are carfree because that will protect the air we breath by bringing the congestion down and also we will have less car accident. where everyone can take the bus or we can just walk to wherever we need to go. it would be a good opportunity to lower the cars accidents and the pollution.""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car , and that will have to change "" we can centered that development on something better , on something that will be on our benefit and that will help us to move forward not that the cars doesn't help us but it also pollute the air we breath and we need the air more then we need the cars , might as well reduce the development of car to protect ourselves. ""In previous bills , 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport "".

There's also the gas money , the car accidents and if you take a light the tickets bills and the money for when you taking the highway. People shouldn't have all those trouble coming with the car , thats why the percentage reduce because most people now just take the bus or walk.

"Dear Senator, The topic of the Electoral college is a hot one, and the idea of whether of not to adjust it is controversial. Many citizen disagree with the process while many are in favor. What should we do? We should change the Electoral College. The voting is based more on quantity instead of quality, and the voting is not coming from the citizen's directly, making the risk of an unfaithful candidate too high and the actual voting less popular and more electoral. When one stateor even one person could change the whole ball game that is the Presidential Election, then what does that mean for our democracy?

While many will argue that it is a fair way to vote, the Electoral College has many flaws. First off, the candidates are focusing on more power and higher tallying states to get them through the election than everyone as a whole. For example, if you were a presidential candidate would you spend more time trying to sway California, with its whopping 55 electoral votes, or montana, with a teeny tiny 3 electoral votes? The candidates are not being considerate of ALL the American citizens, but instead the ones that they think will lead them to victory. This is not what the election is all about. The election is more focused on the popular vote of few states with many inhabitants than it is on many states with few citizens.

""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" As stated in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" . Being that this true, why do we call it the ""Presidential Election"" instead of the ""Electors Election?"" Electors claim to be faithful to their candidates but sometimes this is not the case. If a member of the group is unfaithful to their candidate, it could unsettle the whole election, meaning that the United States as a whole would have to pay for the electors actions. This is not how voting was meant to be. Our slogan is ""We the People,"" not ""We the Electors."" Now, I know what you're thinking, ""Why would we change this system? It is already established and has worked for many years."" In order to move forward as a nation we as a whole need to make changes sometimes. Just think what it would be like today if segregationan established rule and law was not questioned. Or even if the settlers of the United States had not questioned our former mother country and broke away. We would not even be the establishment we are today if we did not question established rules or traditions. The Electoral College is nothing more than a system that needs to be reevaluated, putting the popularity if the candidate in clearer perspective.

To recap, The Electoral College does not include the popularity of the candidates over official influences. The states are not being counted equally and electors control the electon overall. In order to have a more successful government and a more included population, the Electoral College simply needs to be reevaluated and changed to meet the popularity standards of our country if we are to ever advance.",0
""" What's wrong with the Electoral College?"" To be honest, have you ever thought where our vote goes. Just in case you forgot, when we vote we're not voting for the President. We're voting for slate electors who would vote for the President, but how could we be sure that they make the right decision for all Americn Citizens.

I write this letter in favor to inform you that the electoral college is an unfair advantage for American citizens. I see how from a stand point you may trust the electoral college due to abundance of knowledge and critique they have. Yes, I can tell why you'd chose them in a way that they may have strong critique. But how can you trust them with a decision held in their hands with willing citizens to think about. "" At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "" swing"" states"". Why is it continuing base it off of this knowing how American's feel about this matter? Which brings me back to why Americans have to feel like they have an unfair say on who the President can or could be? Perhaps reasoning is the EC Electoral College knows whats best for the American future. Thinking about the effects of the EC voting for the President could possibly vary in results and mat be right. But shine a little light on the situation, it should be in America's people hands and hearts who the president should be.""... candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning..."" Why should we feel like that? American's sould have the right to vote for our leader not people who vote for our leader.

Hold on, I'm not finished yet. Another reason why is when American's vote how could we be sure who to vote for. I agree that Americans can make and exercise their decisions when voting for the Eletoral College. American's are depended on voting , another fact I agree on. But American's sometimes dont know better when voting. "" The American people should consider themselves lucky that the two thousand fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Sometimes it would be the Americans that throw off the vote for the EC, but in other perspective that wouldn't be the case. Americans should vote wisly upon the information given. but yet the electoral college shouldn't vote for the citizens of the United States, Info should be viewed. I can visaulize someone else perspective it could be with different electorsl parties. But in reverse think about the the biggest election crisis in 2000."" Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". Keeping in mind that we should still vote for our President but at the same keep in mind who citizens are voting for so another voting crisis wouldn't happen again.

In conclusion, I hope you clearly thought it through and thorough. Its hard to rely on other's with a big responsiblity like this. So the Government should let us trust our instincts and but at the same time think them out.",0
"Imagine getting off work on a Friday at five o'clock, there's no bumper to bumper traffic, no horns honking at each other, and no stressful commutes home. This is unimaginable for people who reside in the U.S., but people in parts of Europe live like that every day. There are many advantages to cutting down on car usage.

One advantage to this cut would be that you would be saving money. Many people who drive tend to get in accidents or get pulled over by police for speeding. These incidents are very costly and come with repercussions if you don't pay them. Another way you would be saving money is not having to pay for gas. Gas may be only 2.00 for now, but when those prices go on that incline again it becomes very costly to fill up the tank. If you can't afford to fill up your tank then you will be putting wear and tear on the car which leads to more more money being spent to maintenance it. Alternate transportation that's more cost efficient is taking the city bus. It costs about 1 to get from point A to point B where it would cost you about 6 in gas to get you to the same place. You could also purchase a bicycle to take you where you need to go. Maintnancing a bike is a lot cheaper than a car.

A second advantage that limiting car usage has is that it eliminates pollution. A car gives off sound, light, and air pollution which all effect our ecosystem whether you notice it or not. The U.S may not have as much air pollution as other countries but with the increase in car purchases it could get worse. I'm not saying youn have to completely get rid of your vehicles, but maybe the license plate bill may work. Every other day only license plates that begin or end with odd numbers could drive, and on the days the odds can't drive we allow the plates with the even numbers to drive. People could car pool with coworkers on the days that whoever has those plates can drive. We just need to start taking percausions on our car usage.

In the car free test cities people are overall happier because they aren't so stressed worrying about being late due to traffic or getting in an accident. Driving can be extremely stressful especially with the many things that can distract people so easily. These distractions can lead to accidents or just more stress. "" when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter, mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children driwn out the distant motor.""Source 1, Paragraph 3, Lines 411 This quote puts an image in my mind that is happy and stress free. Imagine how happy you would be if everything was conviently close to youer home and you could enjoy walks or biek rides places with your kids.

People should take a moment and think about ehat life without depending on cars would be like. Would you be healthier, happier, or not? Just take into consideration how you would live and be if we didn't have to rely on cars.",0
"Everyday a great many people drive their cars to commute to work, run errands, and sometimes drive their cars for career related purposes. Little do they know that the greenhousee gas emissions that their automobiles create are damaging the environment and creating large amounts of pollution in metropolitan areas. To help reduce the gas emmisions caused by automobiles many countries around the world have created programs and communities that are designed to lessen the amount of car usage in the areas that they are employed in. In doing so they have reduced the amount of greenhousee gasses in Earth's atmosphere along with producing many other benefits.

Of all the advantages of limited car usage the most attractive one would definetely have to be reduced pollution and greenhousee gas emissions. Not only will people save money on fuel in communities that forbid the usage of cars but they will save the planet as well. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" The information shows that a large amount of gas emissions can be produced by automobiles. Assume that there were a lot of cities that had incredibly low rates of car usage. If those city's greenhouse gas emission levels were compared to those of an average car filled city then it would be logical that the carfree city produced less greenhousee gasses.

Another positive change that has the ability to happen in cities and communities that limit their car usage is that municipal development can occur. When people start to use cars less and less then businesses would most likely move to more accessible locations which in turn may give the businesses more customers. Due to the increased business in certain stores, stores from different companies will likely move in to areas in and around the one the other businesses reside in to drum up their sales as well. The article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" supports my statement in the with the sentence, ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" The sentence shows the correlation between lessening car usage and municipal development.

In the end, the advantages of limiting car usage are as bountiful as fish in the ocean. From lessening the amount of pollution in cities to aiding the development of cities, limiting car usage can do great things.",0
"In a society where things are always changing and schedules are always busy, cars and other personal motor vehicles have become a necessity. It seems as if cars have become a necessary mean for survival, rendering as important as something imperative like oxygen or water. Many families even have multiple cars in order to get to where the need to go. Even though cars have been so convenient and beneficial for people all over the world, there are some factors of cars that produce a negative effect. By eliminating or largly reducing car usage, the world would be more safe, more ecofriendly, and save the precious natural gases that the Earth provides.

For years people have been driving, and while most do it safely, some do it recklessly and do not abide by the rules, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes. Reckless driving, careless driving, and driving under the influence has become one of the leading causes of death among young people, making many very skeptical or cautious about driving. Millions of people are lost each year in car accidents, leaving behind family members and loved ones to grieve in their place. If cars were to be eliminated from the equation, all of these deaths could easily be avoided. By walking, riding bicycles, taking the bus or subway, or even a trolley or ferry, there will be an ensured reduction of accidents and an increase in safety and peace of mind.

In addition to increased safety, there would also be a significant reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases and smog have been polluting the atmosphere especially since the coming about of cars. It says in source four that transportation produces half of America's carbon emission. If car usage were to be limited or eliminated, there would be a noticeable and significant decrease in the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Similarly, source one states that, "" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" If cars were to be ridden of, there would be much less green house gas poluting the atmosphere, therefore creating a cleaner environment and a brighter and longer future for the generations to come.

Similarly, the removal of cars from the world would mean the preservation of nonrenewable resources. Since cars run on gasoline, diesel, and other natural gases, the resources are being burned up faster than they can replenish themselves. There are other things that rely on the natural gases to work, cars included. If cars were to be eliminated, and not use the gases at the rapid rate that they do, there would be a huge reduction in the usage for fossil fuels, therefore preserving the remaining resources and only using them when mandatory. This would allow the natural gases to slowly increase and be able for use in the future.

In conclusion, the limitations of car usage would make a significant change in the way the world runs, however there would be many positive outcomes to it. Not only would it ensure a brighter, longer, and more promising future for the coming generations, but it would also relieve stress and worrying and grant peace of mind to many. Although there is no way to take back the damage already done to the Earth, this would greatly reduce the potential damage that could be done, and protect the future. It would provide oppurtunities for a a cleaner atmosphere, safer life, living in harmony with the ecosystem, and a chance to respect and protect the Earth we live on.",0
"All around the world, cars have influence our lives for the good or for the bad. Whether that is getting people to their jobs or getting into an accident. Cars have altered our lives and are doing it constantly. Although for a century cars have benefited humans greatly, cars have negative effects and banning cars can help decrease the pollution all over the world, it saves the little resoucers the planet has, and car accidents will occur less.

To elaborate more, countries all over the world are trying new ways to decrease the air pollution as much as possible, whether that is banning cars or restricting them. In Vauban, German cars are restricted and if you have a car it is very expensive to use. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not have cars, and inorder to move in to the town 57 percent sold their cars. The idea of restricted areas are getting big ,and for Vuaban has 5,500 residents, that shows that people like the idea and will support it. People in the town have claim to enjoy it alot and are happier. In Paris, France their idea to help low the pollution in the air was to have specific licenses plats restricted on certain days of the week. France had very bad smog and within 5 days the smog decrease 60 percent. In Bogota, Columbia they had similar goals as other countries like Germany. Carlos Arturo Plaza said,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In Europe cars make up 12 percent of the greenhouse gas and air pollution. In the United States Americans are driving less and the pollution in the air is decreasing, benefiting the environment. Throughout the world, countries are tring to help the world, by decreasing the pollution.

Moreover, throughout the century cars have been using non renewable resoucers and now that alot of the people have cars, it has taken a toll on the environment. The world has only so much resoucers and once its gone it is gone, it takes time for them to come back and it willl not be in our life time. Using these resoucers have a negative effect they emit carbon in to the atmosphere creating greenhouse gas, that is bad. saving the resoucers and not using them can help with keeping the atmopshere cleaner.

Now people are banning and restricting cars for various reasons, but one reason is that for the past century cars have killed alot of people. It is one of the top reasons for deaths in the United States and possibly in the world. If banning cars can save thousands of lifes why not do it. Banning cars or restricting cars means less cars which can result to less car accidents. Having less accidents results to less people getting hurt and potenially dying. Less cars can also mean that the goverment does have to focuse on roads and stuff like that ,but can focuse on improving the safty of the people on the sidewalks or at playgrounds. the funds can go to better causes.

The world we live has changed enormously and now inorder to save the plant and the people in it, we must make changes as a society, inorder to live long and healthy. Banning cars might be one of the many choices we must make inorder to live. Banning cars can help decrease the greenhouse gases, conserve the resoucers, and less people will die from car accidents. Who knows cars may be a thing in the past int he next decade or two.",0
"Do you want to elect the president? The electoral college doesn't allow that unless you're an elector. Voting for president should be done with a popular vote rather than an electoral college. An electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

An electoral college is unfair. In source two, it says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning..."" This shows that candidates don't treat everyone the same. They spend more time in states that have a chance of winning. Some states never even get to see who the candidates are.

Not only are electoral colleges unfair, they're also outdated. The electoral college has been being used since 1960. In source two, it says, "" It happened in Hawaii in 1960."" This proves that the electoral college has been around for many years, and it's time for something new. Things change along with time, a new system would improve voting.

The electoral college is irrational. In an electoral college, you don't vote for the president, you vote for a slate of electors that then vote for the president. In source two, it says, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This proves that the system doesn't make sense and citizens should be able to directly vote for the president of their country.

To conclude, the electoral college system should be abolished. It is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Abolishing the electoral college would improve voting and make citizens want to vote.",0
"As crazy as living without a car sounds, more and more people are doing it. One popular reason for it is for a healthier and happier lifestyle. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's short story titled In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Heidrun Walter reports ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Her and many others like her in the town of Vauban, Germany have experienced the difference and felt stress go away. The city has banned driveways and home garages, encouraging the rule of living ""carfree."" The people rely on public transit, bicycles and their own two legs. While many people are stressing to get a car, the people of the town feel stressed if they have a car. Over half the population sold their cars to move there, and don't regret a thing. In the article titled Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , Andrew Selsky quotes Carlos Arturo Plaza as saying ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"" as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.

Also Carlos Arturo Plaza goes on to say ""it's a good opportunity to lower air pollution."" People are realizing how many pollutants that cars emitt into the atmosphere. One example place is Paris, known for their terrible smog, has finally done something to clean it up. Robert Duffer wrote in ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The law stated even numbered license plates couldn't drive one day, and the other, odd license plates couldn't. A little thing like this had a big effect. Duffer then reported ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" Elizabeth Rosenthal in the article The End of Car Culture showed the idea "" if these patterns persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Americans are partically to blame for pollution. Our need for the newest, biggest, best things, has come at a cost, and more than money. Greenhouse gases are stacking up, and we have to take a stand some time. Rosenthal goes on to describe political leaders are working to fix this too, ""President Obama's abitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions were unveiled last week."" In places already practicing the no car rule, environments have improved more than pollution wise. Andrew Selsky reported of ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" These two additions of Bogota, Colombia have inspired many people to turn in their keys, and take a hike instead. Not only have these changes made people more happy, but it makes their city more beautiful and they are starting to get outdoors and see it. The author reports that ""municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event carfree day and were enthuriastic,"" amung the people visiting was the Mayor of Paraguay's capital city. When more people see the effects, they want to do the same thing. Columbia's one day event has brought about much talk in neighboring towns and even ""two other Colombian cities, Calli and Valledupar, joined the event."" On the other side of the argument, many car industries are trying to compete with these new ideas and technology. Rosenthal quotes in ""But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"" As humans advance into the ideas of walking, biking, or taking public transportation, car companies strive to become known for things other than cars. They want to be able to sell you things still, even if you don't want or need a car. Later she writes how Bill Ford proposed the fresh idea at the Mobile World Congress that car dealers should ""partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" This long quote simply means having all forms of transportion and the new technology in communications to be one, for the better of the people.

With or without cars, we all are always on the move. Some cities have adapted new ideas to get from place to place, or simply old ideas, being put back into action. Although Henry Ford would probably be dissapointed at his invention being faded out, Mother Nature would be pleased of us taking care of Earth. We never know what the future holds, but we do know, we'll always only have one home, so we better take care of it.",0
"Many people agree in abolishing the Electoral College. Electoral Collage caused a dispute in the year 2000. The Electoral College is a irrational system and it should be banned.

Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast."" With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any runoff elections. Runoff elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.

A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" argues that the Electoral College causes "" the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that the voters can not always ""control whom their electors vote for,"" We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The reasonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.

Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes ""that the electors could always defy the will of the people,"" The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors "" have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.

In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all.",0
"Every day people wake up, get ready, and go to work or school. The way they get there can vary but for the most part, people drive cars. That's about to change. Helping the environment and becoming more relaxed are advantages for limiting car usage.

By reducing car usage, emmitions produced from automobiles can be reduced and help the environment. When cars release gas into the air, it causes smog which traps the gases and inhibits them from being able to escape the atmosphere. In largely congested cities smog can be as harmful as 147 micrograms of particulate matter as seen in Paris, France paragraph 17. Paris enforced a partial driving ban due the amount of smog and just after one day of reduced driving, the smog clears enough so they didn't have to enforce the ban another day paragraph 19. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United States. paragraph 5. This staggering statistic can open your eyes to how much cars really effect the environment. If just once a week you didn't use your car, you could reduce greenhouse gases drastically. In the United States today, recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, and are driving less. paragraph 29. Since 1995, the number of miles driven per person dropped almost 9 percent paragraph 32. With lesser people buying and driving new cars, gas emissions could change drastically within a few years and could help our evrioment exonentialy.

When you do not drive a car to from places every day, you become a more relaxed person. In Vauban, Germany residents have given up cars almost all together, only 30 percent of residents owning cars. In this Suburban town, it seems comman for mothers to own a minivan to ship children back and forth all throughout town Heidrun Walter feels other wise. She has given up her automobile to get around town and ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter states. paragraph 3. For the past three years in Bogota, Colombia they take a day out of the year where only taxis and buses are permitted, the Day Without Cars. Even when dark clouds circled around the city and rain splattered down onto the heads of people, they didn't revert back to their cars. A businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" paragraph 24. This day has become so popular, two other cities in Columbia joined in as well the celebrate the day where people do not use their cars. People do not need to meet with other people in order to go to work or hangout with friends anymore they can be in their own homes using the technology they access see their friends and continue to do their work.paragraph 35. Without having to commute to an office, people feel less stressed and more relaxed being able to do their work in the comfort of their own home.

People used to accossicate cars as the best way to get from place A to B without thinking about the consequences it can have on the planet or on yourself. You have to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.",0
"The electoral college is an unfair and outdated system. It is unfair to voters. A states electoral votes often do not tell what that state truly wants. And no candidate should face what Gore did in 2000, with a winning popular vote, but less electoral votes losing him the election. It is an outdated system that should not be used in today's modern society.

When we vote for a specific president, we are actually voting for a slate of electors. The chosen electors are supposed to support the winning candidate, but they can easily decide to ignore that and cast their vote toward whomever the please. This can cause a president to get the greatest popular vote, and still lose because they did not get as many electoral college votes once all states' votes have been combined. This should certainly not happen. Whatever candidate is preferred by the most people to take office should win the election, period. In the past, maybe it would have been good to let the more educated electors choose the president rather than any citizen, but in this modern age of knowledge, people can be trusted to choose a leader that shares in the best interests of our country. Al Gore in 2000 lost the election after winning the most popular votes. That shows us that this electoral system does not work effectively, and should not be used today.

Perhaps more worrying is the electoral college's winnertakeall system. If a candidate wins a state's election by a tiny amount, they get every electoral vote for that state. This allows candidates to ignore smaller states, or states they know they will win, and focus on larger states and ones that have a very tight election could be easily persuaded for advertisements and campaigns. Ohio is known as a state that looks at their candidates closely, and can be persuaded to choose one based on what they know about them. Candidates tend to focus more resources here or in other similar states. It makes some sense to focus more on larger populations, and states like Ohio that are more interested in the election, but during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, and could not make educated decisions during the election. In a close election, half the people in the state's views will be ignored, and will not matter to the election. That means half of California's 35 million voters would not matter at all in the election. The fate of the election should not be put in the hands of Ohio or other ""swing"" states, just ignoring less important ones.

Today's society needs a more fair system of electing a president. A popular vote from everyone is the most fair way to make sure the most popular candidate wins the election, and will cause candidates to focus on all citizens, focusing on large populations, but still trying to gain popularity with rural areas as well. America's citizens deserve a fair, proper election, that satisfies the most people possible.",0
"The Electoral College is America's current method of election. A process created by our founding fathers that consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Many Americans believe that this method is crucial because it's certainty of outcomes and the way it avoids runoff elections. However many people believe it creates more of a problem than a solution. Problems created under the electoral college system include, big states recieving more attention than small states, the disaster factor, and the winnertakeall method which causes unfairness among voters.

Each state has a different number of electors based on the number of members in it's congressional delegation. A lot of the time bigger states tend to have a larger amount of electors, for example the state of Hawaii has four while the state of texas has 38. This causes more attention to go towards the big states. Another example of this dilemma is shown by an excerpt from Bradford Plumer which says ""each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to represent the will of the people"".

The current system of election leaves room for multiple disasters to occur. Disasters such as the 2000 fiasco in which Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Another issue caused is a question of the electors loyalty to their candidate. Perhaps the Elector of a certain state decides against the election of their party and casts a deciding vote for whoever they please. This creates an unreliable system they could change the fate of an election in an instant. Even more serious issues could arise such as a state sending two slates of electors which Hawaii did in 1960.

Lastly, the Electoral College is a faulty system because of it's winnertakeall method. Most states have this method in which the winning presidential candidate is awarded all the electors. Due to this the candidates don't spend time int he states they know have no chance of winning, and only focus on tight races in the ""swing states"". As stated in an article by Richard A. Posner ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single ad.

All in all, the Electoral College is an unreliable system of election. It causes many issues to arise and is all around unfair to voters. Many important people such as Richard Nixon, and Jimmy carter agree that America should abolish it all together. The issues caused such as unequal attention on states based on size, unfaithfulness of electors, and an unfair winnertakesall method prove the the Electoral College undeniably, causes more problems than solutions.",0
"""I'm much happier this way,"" What caused someone to say this? Simply no longer owning a car! Based on how car dependant mostly everyone's life is and how badly most people that don't have a car want one you'd think that going from having one to lacking one must be terrible. Well statistically speaking we might all be moving towards this idea and it might not be such a bad thing!

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Vauban, Germany is home to people that have chosen to give life without cars a shot, many of which love the life style. 70% of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car just to go there. Although this has mostly only been done here many have started slowly adopting the idea. As the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal, of this article pointed out passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse emissions in Europe, and in more car populated areas such as the United States up to 50%. Robert Duffer stated in Paris bans driving due to smog that in Paris Driving had been limited by their government due to extreme levels of pollution and after a short amount of time the ban was called off because the smogpollution had lowered. Just one of the advantages of limiting the usage of cars would be cutting down these huge numbers and getting rid of these issues, and if you asked anyone im pretty sure they'd say that this one advantage is plenty reason already to look into this. Imagine how drastically improved the planet would be if others adopted what Vauban is already doing!

Want a holiday to promote the limiting of cars? Well there actually is one in Bogota, Colombia! Millions of colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to places like work on this day. It already has three years running so far, even if its raining that day, the mayor claims that it doesnt stop people from participating. This day is starting to also branch out to other colombian cities such as Cali and Valledupar, imagine if eventually it becomes an international holiday, the advantages are everywhere. Due to the limiting of car usage there are more people walking on the sidewalks and this has caused the government to improve those sidewalks by making new smooth ones and getting rid of the old cracked ones. More restaurants, parks, sports centers, and even entire shopping centers have been built and opened to the people walking which is a life style improving advantage. If the limiting of cars is done in more places then new things to do and try will open up in that area and in turn prove to be a great advantage from limiting car usage.

Elisabeth Rosenthal has writen about the possibility that in the United States the peak of driving has been reached. As it turns out Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less miles on average, and getting fewer licenses every year that goes by. If such a large population such as the United States is cooling down on car usage why not speed that process up and governments start slowly but efficiently reducing car usage internationally? This would mean that in public transport there would be more socializing because the people that take that same bus everyday at 7:00 AM along with you would become your friends or at least aquaintances. So when you think about it friendships might even come with car limiting as well!

From the reduction of polution to the improvements of everyday life style to even possibly socializing with new people, the possibilities of car usage limiting are endless.",0
"The usage of motor vehicles has been on a steady decline for the last several years. More and more people are relying on carpooling and other means of transportation. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's articles, she discusses Vauban, Germany, where cars are forbidden and how the use of cars has been on the decline. In Robert buffer's article, he talks about Paris' issues with pollution and the ways it has been dealt with. In Andrew Selsky's article, he talks about a program in Colombia when citizens use other means of transportation other than cars. The perks of limiting car usage include less pollution, less traffic congestion, and improved safety.

The main culprit of pollution issues is car usage. In Source 2, Robert Duffer says that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...""Duffer 16 This is because of a tax policy that has a preference to this fuel. Diesel fuel is a lot more harmful than regular gasoline, and if many people are using this fuel pollution rates will skyrocket. Cutting down on these fuels altogether could create a less polluted environment. In addition, cars cause 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50 percent in specific places in the U.SRosenthal 5. This statistic is startling, since half of the pollution problems in the U.S are associated to cars. By using other means of transportation such as the train or even carpooling, this number can be greatly reduced to a much smaller percentage.

With more cars, more traffic congestion occurs. A sign of this congestion is evident when Rosenthal says""New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities.Rosenthal 37"" A lot of people are still using their own vehicles to get from point A to B, and as a result their is more money that has been given to toll bridges because of that. The encouragement of governments to suggest carpooling services and shared rides will decrease the revenue that comes from tolls. If everybody shared a ride with a person from work or from somewhere else, there would be a great decrease in traffic congestion.

Furthermore, public transportation such as the BART in the San Francisco Bay area has decreased the amount of drivers on the road. Although the rides are typically longer than driving a car from point A to B, it is a more efficient method of transportation.Rosenthal 40 Using these alternate methods of transportation decreases the amount of cars on the road at once. With less cars on the road at once, there is more efficiency in getting where you need to go.

Safety is one of the most important aspects of reducing the amount of cars. In Colombia, a program promotes the use of no cars one day per year. Many of the citizens use alternate methods of transportation such as walking and riding bikes.Selsky 20By promoting this, there are obviously less cars on the road and a lesser risk of people being injured by cars. With programs that promote other modes of transportation, many lives can be saved since there would be fewer cars on the road. Although many people require cars to get from place to place, the idea of lives being saved is something that shouldn't be ignored. Also, technology has aided the decline in cars. Telecommunication has helped people become connected to friends and family in a way without meeting with them face to face.Rosenthal 35 Because of this, people dont have to travel to meet with their friends and family. This has created a domino effect people can communicate through social media and texting which causes less cars to be on the road to visit other people and overall causes less safety isssues.

In conclusion, cars are the focal point of many issues in our society. They cause many safety issues such as traffic accidents,more traffic congestion which causes increases in revenue in tolls, and pollution issues. By reducing car usage, many of these problems can disappear, and can create a safer and healthier environment.",0
"The Electoral college is a process where electors vote for President and Vice President, and count the number of electoral votes by Congress. Many people are debating whether or not keep the Electoral collegee or change it to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Although the Electoral collegee has been taking place for many years now, it can be a disaster factor. I believe that the Electoral collegee should be abolished and changed to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it will make the election fair, the chance of there being a tie is much less, and it will be rather rational as oposed to the Electoral collegee.

The Electoral collegee is not fair and it is irrational. Voters don't vote directly to the president they want. According to Source 1: ""What is the Electoral collegee?"" voters actually voting for their candidate's electors. Majority of the states have a ""winner take all"" system in which electors are awarded to the winning candidate. Voters don't get to chose who exactly they want, it's based upon which elector they chose that really determines who will win the presidential election. The voters can't always control what the elector they chose does with what thy're decision was on who they wanted to win the election, and they just as well get confused and sometimes possibly make the wrong choice. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is fair for anyone who votes. There is less chance of getting confused and less chance of picking the wrong elector. Even though others may argue that each party selects trusted electors to vote for the patry's nominees, it's still not fair to those who get confused and end up picking the wrong elector which leads to wrong vote towards the presidential election.

The chances of it turning out to be a tie aren't low. according to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", a tie has happened before. States have sent two states of electors to Congress. Although it happened long ago, it doesn't mean that it won't occur anytime again. Abolishing the Electoral collegee can give a less chance for that to occur. Since staes have the ""winner take all"" system, the candidates don't even spend time or focus on the states that the know they have no chance in winning in. According to source 2, there were seventeen states who didn't even get to see the election at all, and some votes didn't even get to see the ad of the campaign.

The presidential election will become rational to many people. There may be cons to abolishing the Electoral collegee but there are more pros to it rather than cons. It would make the presidential election fair and easier for the voters voting for the candidates. People may argue that it's best to keep the Electoral collegee because some states may not have enough people voting for the candidates so it wouldn't be possible to directly vote for the president of the United States but there are more states who do have the chance to chose and make a direct decision rather than picking an elector who may or may not go agaisnt the party that had picked them and then they can end up chosing who they, the electors want instead of what the voter really wanted and intended. Many people may be able to agree that it is best to abolish the Electoral collegee instead of keeping it. The electors are picked mostly based upon the state.

Abolishing the Electoral collegee is the fair, rational, and beneficial thing to do. Keeping the Electoral collegee won't benefit the presidential election in any way possible. It's better to keep the election fair than otherwise. Voters should be able to know exaclty who they're picking without any confusion or without accidently picking the wrong person. People shouldn't need to be confused about who they're picking and they shouldn't have to posibly worry at the fact that the elector they voted for might defy the will of the voters and they would pick who they, the voters feel like picking rather than picking who the voters vote was actually intended for in the first place. There are risks to basically putting the voters vote in someone elses hands and the voters vote can easily be changed by one of the electors that the party had picked because they trusted that person. If the presidential election was about who you can pick directly, then it would be much easier and the voters will know that the presidential election was fair and nothing was done to change who they voted for in the beginning.",0
"At first, the idea of not using a car may seem like an extreme inconvience that comes with endless problems. However after looking into the matter there are many hidden advantages. One can lessen emissions, and help create a less polluted environment for themselves. One may also be able to save money by simply taking alternate types of transportation.

By using a car less, one can help decrease the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Paragraph five by Elisabeth Rosenthal, states that up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are due to passenger cars. While these numbers may seem daunting, some cities have reduced their pollution in simple ways. For example, Paris experienced record breaking air pollution caused by emissions. This drove leaders to put in place a ban on certain cars driving during specific days of the week. Not only did the smog clear within one day, but sixty percent of car traffic was down too. If parishes problem was fixed by making a simple switch, then less polluted cities could easily decrease their emissions swell.

One can also save money by avoiding cars. Not only are cars expensive in the first place, but as explained by Rosenthal in paragraph twenty nine, the bridge and tunnel tolls are rising. Bikes on the other hand, are a great alternative because they are inexpensive and they have free paths. One may argue that it is impossible to get the public to ditch their cars for human powered machines, but in Bogota, colombia, this is already happening. For one day each year cars are banned, and only certain types of vehicles are allowed. Selsky explains in paragraph twenty that millions participated, even on rainy days. Here one can see that this alternative transportation idea is not a couple of people, but a widespread movement.

Overall, lessening ones usage of cars has many benefits. Not only can one help ensure cleaner air, but they can save money while their at it. By making small changes in ones everyday life, huge impacts can be made on the community.",0
"We use cars every day, but have we ever actually stopped to realize the stress and pollution they cause? Now think just how many advantages there would be if we limited car usage. There would be less stress, it would be less dangerous, and there would be less pollution. Not only would we be helping the environment, but also helping to protect our families from the harm cars can cause.

Stress we all experience it. It's become such a big factor in everyones life. One of the most stressful things is sitting in a traffic jam when you are already late to work, but think, if we limited the usage of cars, there wouldn't be so many traffic jams. In the third essay, by Andrew Selsky, a man and his wife state ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress"". Traffic jams are stressful no matter where you are going. They make you impatient and easily annoyed. Stress has a very big impact on your health too. Sitting in a traffic jam every day and being under that kind of stress can start to affect your health poorly.

Cars are a very dangerous piece of machine. They are manmade and sometimes they have flaws. Some of these flaws might be a quick fix, but others may be fatal. Many people have lost their lives while at the wheel of a car. Many people have lost loved ones to terrible car crashes. Limiting the usage of cars will end up resulting in a lower crash rate. With a lower crash rate we can ensure the safety of our families, more than we ever could before.

According to the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" Pollution is a dangerous thing. It may seem like nothing, but it has a bigger threat than any of us realize. Pollution is taking away all of the clean air we have left to breathe. With power plants emitting such harmful fumes, and now cars, our air is being polluted quicker then we ever thought possible. Helping to reduce car usage will reduce the pollution in the air. We will be, not only helping our environment, but also helping our children. As kids grow older, we can help them have a healthy earth, and clean air to breathe.

Considering all of the advantages to decreasing the usage of cars, we may want to join in on what parts of Europe and Colombia have already started to work on. According to the article by Andrew Selsky, Colombia has a ""Day Without Cars"" that happens once every year. This has been happening for three straight years. In German, there is a suburb where people live, and most do not own cars. While in Paris they have also started having a day of no driving. This has helped to clean up their air and decrease the amount of stress people go through while driving. Cars are very convienent, but are they so convienent when they cause so much harm.",0
"cars are everywhere these days, and they are commonplace among us. getting from point a to point i almost always involves using a car. iut there is a different method of transportation emerging and that is puilic transportation. there are many ienefits to puilic transportation including reducing emissions, having less cars on the road, and improving cities. this one farfetched idea is now coming into the spotlight.

in cities like chicago and new york, the skies are dark and gloomy and pollution is in the air. the main contriiuting source come from emissions from cars. limiting the usage of cars would help to clear the skies and stop some pollution from filling the air. the quality of life would then ie much ietter in these cities. ""after days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ian to clear the air of the gloial city."" paris needed to ian cars iecause the smog and pollution in the city was getting out of hand. if there were fewer cars in the city, this type of proilem would never ie an issue here or around the world.

traffic is always a iig issue on the roads around the united states and the world. limiting car usage would ease the traffic and make roads a lot safer. when the car ian was in place in paris ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" when less cars were out on the road, accidents would ie greatly reduced and city highways like the ones in chicago, illinois would ie much more manageaile. there would ie more money to work on roads since the traffic is reduced and the roads would also stay in prestine condition for longer amounts of time. events like carfree day have already had iig impacts in other parts of the world and the impact would ie even greater in larger countries such as the united states. ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" having less cars on the road would ienefit our society in more ways than one.

quite a few years ago, ideas such as puilic transportation iecoming mainstream seemed pretty farfetched. well today, those ideas can help iuisnessses and whole towns limit car usage. when cars are used less frequently, the areas that have more frequent usage will ie cared for even more. new sidewalks, restaurants, and shopping will emerge throughout cities and ie a huge advantage. caring for roads have little ienefit and putting money into puilic areas will help out cities tremendously. ""parks and sports centers also have iloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have ieen replaced iy iroad, smooth sidewalks. new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" using puilic transportation instaid of cars will greatly improve cities.

cars have ieen around for a long time and have served us for many years. now, reducing or getting rid of them seems like a viaile option iecause emissions will ie reduced, there will ie less cars on the road, and cities would ie improved. this task of getting rid of cars may seem hard to do iut the infrastructure for it is already in place. puilic transportation is already in larger cities such as new york and chicago and it can easily ie installed in smaller towns and communities. the advantages such as less pollution and more greatly outweigh the minor inconveniences. smart planning is the iest option to encompass all of these ideas. "" it separates suiurian life from auto use, as a component of a movement called smart planning."" smart planning is not only the wisest opportunities and advantages of limiting car usage for now, it is also meant to help future generations have a safer and cleaner world to live in.",0
"Some people like to drive while others don't and some countries are making bans or just limiting the usage of cars. This can have more advantages than disadvantages.

When people drive cars they let out pollution into the air which harms the atmosphere. The advantages to this is that if people don't drive that much anymore the pollution can be stopped at a certain point and cause no harm anymore of course the air might still be polluted but with a less perentage. People would definitely use money on something else thtne to try and get the new car or just use it on gas. There are alternatives to limit the use of cars.

sociologists believe if this continues with people limiting car transportation that ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emission, just behind power plants."" so if we all got to think about it we are basically doing a favor to ourselves by helping the planet by limiting the use of cars.

Another advantage that this idea might have is that the people in the community could stop spending more money due to cuts in the job. They waste money on gas on new cars, etc. When really you could be doing something better with that money.

Most poeple dont even really need cars they use them for the heck of it. Teenagers use it just to go around with friends or go to work but really they could limit that use and find another way of transportation. This isn't saying to just stop using your car but just finding a way to say that if you dont really need your car but just using it for fun then you could limit that use and instead of driving to places that are close to you just walk there.

The author of ""The End of Car Culture"" elisabeth Rosenthal even said that her own kids being 19 and 21 ""have not even bothered to get a driver's license...."" they find other ways to get around she said ""they organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends"" as i said before there are alternatives to limiting the usage of cars and this could be one of them if you are with friends and all are going to the same palce then you ca just share one car so that not all of the cars are ut it can avoid traffic and cost less money to you also.

In conclusion, I say that there are alot of advantages to limiting the use of cars and we could most definitely make more.",0
"Having a limit on car usage has many advantages to it. This limitation mainly benefits the people and the environment.

A major advantage of the limitation is to help the people. Many of the people like not having cars available. In In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , a family says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.Rosenthal"" Not having a car takes pressure off of the people, because they don't have to worry about filling up on gas. They also like it ,because it encourages more exercise. instead of driving to the store or the park you can walk or take a bicycle. In the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, some of the statistics show that ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the cityuneven, pitter sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut off traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". This is an example of how progressive this change has made on cities. Also mentioned in Selsky article "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Most of the people say that not having cars takes lot of stress off of them. The positive impact on the people is just one of the many advantages of limited car usage.

another advantage is helping the environment. By limiting car use has really impacted the environment. Rosenthal states that ""experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe.... Passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"". This just shows how much of an impact not using cars has been. In article two Duffer explains why Paris created limitation on car usage. Paris had a huge smog and to help clean it up and to prevent from getting worse, Paris made a law that only certain number license plates could drive on certain days and if you drove on the wrong day than you would be fined. But this helped France get their fuel numbers lower. In Selsky article he talks about how Columnia has a ""car free day"". On this day no cars are allowed with the exception of buses and taxis. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". Alot of the people like to participate in this event. In Amercia research has been found that ""Amercians are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" Rosenthal.With this information we can be lowering our pollution on our own. Many people did not like the limitations, but learned to like them considering the end result of a healthier environment. These two advantages of limiting car usage is just a couple of the many.",0
"It's the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, can you guess what it is? It's election day! Every four years, nearly every person in America will vote to choose a new President, or do we? Yes, we live in a democracy where we can vote for who runs out country, but do we really make the decision? The Electoral College is a phase where electors, of a candidate running for president, come together and decide for who is the President, Vice President, and include the counting of the electoral votes from Congress. The person who runs for President has a select group of people known as electors, which are typically chosen by that person's political party. Is this who we really vote for, and is it fair? This should be eradicated.

By using the Electoral College, we don't directly vote for our own President. We vote for fisher's electors. It's them who really choose who leads us, not us! In ""What Is the Electoral College?"" it states that ""...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors,"" meaning we aren't actually voting for a President, just fisher's electors. It could literally be anybody, not holding public office. This is not a direct way for us to vote for who makes the decisions around here. In ""Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" it claims that ""...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Sixty percent said that! That's incredible.

The electoral votes are just unequal. The states that are bigger would obviously get more electoral votes than, let's say Maryland. California would have more votes than Maryland because it i smuch bigger. The House of Represenatives has its own unique way of handling that, and they're going just fine, we don't need another. It just isn't reliable, the numbers and percentages would be all boggled up. This country is based on equality and liberty. and there is no equality in this.

The Electoral College is much too confusing. Sometimes voters could be discombabulated about who it is they are voting for. Sometimes voters can't control who the electors vote for. This is both confusing and frustrating for anyone who thinks they voted for someone great, but the electors change that. In ""Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" it says that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."", meaning that we don't choose for ourselves, they do.

Some could say ""its anarchy"", or that ""its not democratic"", which could be true. In ""In defense of the Electoral College...,"" it states that ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee...however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" This means that even though you vote for a person, it's probably a fiftyfifty chance your person will win. It does also help release the stress of worrying about a runoff election, and avoids the problem where no candidate receives a majority of votes that has been cast.

The Electoral College is not the best way to vote in our beautiful country. It can be decieving and confusing. Though it may have one or two advantages, the list of things that can go wrong with it are of plenty. It is unfair, and could turn nasty. It should be abolished. Make America more equal.",0
"Why should we limit our uses on car usage, some people se the limiting of car usage as less tense. "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said heidrun Walter, a mother of two. when you have a car you'll have to find space for it as well as a house to buy. There are only two places to park at the edge of a development, where a carowner has to pay 40,000, along with a home. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United states. with less cars people have the advantages of being a walk away from a store instead of a highway. With less cars that give off gas emissions the less our ozone will deplete. More and more people are using hybrid cars because they dont give off as much gas emissions than regular cars that take diesel. Depending on the weather of the night and day could really effect the greenhouse effect of our planet. If ther was a cold night and a warm day this could help the warmer layer of air to trap the car emissions, which depletes the ozone layer that is protecting our planet.

Paris one of the most leading countries in the world with the car emissions ended making people stop using their cars because of all the smog that was being created. People who used their cars were fined 31 and if they complained about that their car would sometimes be towed away. While the rule of no cars was in effect the traffic jams in france were down over 60 percent. Think about what this could do to the United States. The smog had cleard so much that Paris eventually allowed odd numbered plates to drive again on Tuesday. "" 'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution said Carlos Arturo as he rode with his wife on a two seat bicycle"" Andrew Selsky, Source 3. The no car rule is sweeping over the nations, because of this rule there has been over 118 miles of bicycle paths in Bogota, Colombia.

"" Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic these poeple are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders' Said Enrique rivera, the mayor of asuncion, Paraguay. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly down by 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January of 1995. Part of the explanation lies in the recession, because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. These people could not afford cars but they could have afforded a bike if they wanted to. They could have rode to work on a bike or could have tried to find a job on a bike it's that people are starting to get to lazy to do important things like ride a bike. With cars theres gas you have to pay for along with the insurance, that's a lot of money.

Lucky for us Americas love affair twords vehicles seem to be coling down. When the number of child growth grew, the number of miles driven dropped steadly down in 2005. With cars the rodes are more dangerous anything could happen to anyone or anything. The percentage of 1639 year olds that are driving dropped, while older people retain thweir licenses as they age. A study last year was found tha driving by younger people dropped by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Bill Ford proposed partnering with telecommunactions industrys to create cities in which "" pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improive safety"". In Germeny the banning of cars resulted that 70 percent of families donot have cars, and 57 perecnt sold a car to move there. In doing all of these thing this could help stop the greenhouse effect on our planet and start saving it insted of killing it.",0
"Cars thery're every where, and people use cars to get from point A to point B. Cars are very important in the lives of many people all over the world. Cars are efficiant and help to get the job done. People often only seem to look at jus the positive sides of cars, but yet tend to oversee the down falls of how the use of cars can have in a persons life. the use of cars many have a few positive aspects but the negatives out way the good. The use of cars effect the environment negatively in a big way, also the use of cars tends to cause people stress that a person might not be aware their going through. The limting of the use of cars is something people must take upoon themselves to look at.

The envorement its all around us, it provides us with the basic nesscities we need to survive the envoirment provides us with oxygen that we need to breathe and food that we need to eat. The use of cars is threating the environment. Cars realse Co2 or carbondioxy into the environment causing the air to be come polluted. according to an article tittled ""paris bans driving due to smog"" writen by Robert Duff. Duff writes about how Paris Frances air had become so polluted due to the realse of co2 admsions that the government had to enforce a band on the use of cars until the smog in the air cleared up. The main casue of the smog in the air was the diesls found in the cars used in France, due the fact that France has a Tax policy that draws towards the use of diesles over gasoline. according to Duffer ""diesels makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to.3 percent average of diesle engins in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters."" In the article Duffer explains how the most populated cities are the ones with the the smog or air pollution. Cities like Beijing and China have alot of smog in the air is because of the use of cars. The use of cars have a very negative impact on the environment. Countries all over the world are taking a step foward towards limting their use on cars due to effects its has. In an article called In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars writen by Elisabeth Rosenthal talks about an upscale community in called Vauban Germany where people have given up theirs cars. In vaughn's 70 percent of the families that resided in vaubans don't own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into the community. Even though alot of the residents of Vauband dont use car some still due. Ownig a car is still allowed vauband uses large garages where people can store their cars,but a person must first purchase a parking space for 40,000 first. While some cars are still used in the comuntiy walk or bycicle as their means of transportation. Vauband is a prime example of of a positive growing trend. Vauband helps to reduce the green house gas emissions cars give off.

While cars can cause harm to the environment, cars can also cause people stress that they themsleves don't know they're dealing with. according to a a qoute found in In german Suburb, Life goes on without Car. Heidrun Walter exprees how without casr lifes is happier ""When I had a car I was always tense.

"The role a car plays in the life of an individual has made changes through out the years. There never was a significant meaning to having a car it just meant having a vehicle that can get you from point A to point B. As the human society continues to progress with the creations of technology, the use of cars has diminished greatly in different parts of the world. Not being able to use a car seems like there is no bright side, but there are actually many advantages on limiting car usage.

The United States always had this recognition of being one of the world's prime car cultures. ""The first Model T cars were born in the U.S. It has also been the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized mustang Sally."" President Barack Obama identifies in the article, The End of Car Culture, his dreams for the U.S ""to curb the United State's geen house gas emissions will get a forturious assist from an incipent shift in American behavior."" Going back to the article as reference, studies show ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by... as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak... there was also a drop in percent of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license."" The cause of the downfall in car usage can be pointed towards a few factors internet making telecommuting possible, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of cellphones and carpooling apps. It is not because society assumes cars are becoming of no use, the role of technological improvements are making things a lot easier than how things were in the 1960's. The United states has the option of using cars or not, in other places like Paris, the option to drive has become a choice made out of a person's own power.

Paris, France is a location that anyone dreams of visiting. The city is beautiful but the levels of smog have made it impossible for people to enjoy the views of the city. According to the article, Paris bans driving due to smog , ""it has been enforced to the citizens of a partial driving ban in order to clear the air... people were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine which is 31 in the United States."" The way things are organized in Paris goes by a person's license plate number. In correlation to the article, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifiying smog."" However, not all of the cars used in Paris, France were banned. Those cars that are plugins, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were allowed to roam the street of Paris. A good majority, 67 percent, of vehicles in France are made up of diesel, and that kind of fuel were the ones to blame since gasoline was not in favor in a city like that one. In the same way, places like Bogota, Colombia, had similar situations as the peolpe that live in France.

In the country of Colombia there has been a day dediated to doing things with no car it's a carfree day. In contrast to how banning driving is in Paris, Bogota, Colombia has everyone participate in this 24 hour event. If a person were to violate the rule they are to face 25 fines. The article, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, explains that ""millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during the carfree day."" Just like the goals in Paris, Colombia has goals to promote alternatice transportation and reduce smog. A businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, explains ""it's good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" No one would everythink that driving is as stressful as going to work. When put into mind, things begin to make sense. The early mornings of road rage people encounter makes their entire day a little more stressful than what it should be. Driving is a wonderful advantage but there is always more than just a car. Colombia's main goal, as expressed in the article ""is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" In the end of it all cars have always been in the making trying to find new ways to improve and modernize. Although cars may have had significant meanings in the older times, as society continues to prosper in technological making, cars are beginning to be identified as material objects that are not as important. They are just in use for people to get from one place to the next when other things are not working.",0
"Some of the advantages of limiting car usage is definitely that it would help not polute the air. With so many people driving cars in small towns that can quickly polute the air, especially in paris in source two where it says ""After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" With all of that pollution it can cause things such as global warming, and unhealthy air for our bodies. With just a small break of not driving the congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of france, after five days of intensifying smog. Also with cold nights and warm days that also causes air to trap car emissions.

Another advantage of not driving cars, would be exercise. That would be such a good work out because you would have no other option except to walkie your bikes. You would get to socialize with everyone else who is walking to their jobs, or the grocery store all while getting a little bit of exercise with your family. With everyone walking and having nothing better to do, sports centers and parks activity has bloomed throughout the city, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up with sales.

More and more people have stopped getting carslicenses and instead taking the city bus, walking or riding their bike. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If more people would continue to either car pool or find a different way to get where they're going the worlds pollution would definitely begin to go down. Without all of the pollution that comes out of cars and that gets trap into the air, our air would begin to get so much more cleaner and safer for us to breathe.

With all of the money it takes to repair the roads, and the electricity it takes to run all of the stop lights, that money could go towards other things if people didnt drive as much as they do. Although many people need and use their cars for transportation theres always other ways to getting around town. It would also help save you money that is spent on gas every week, with the gas prices being unpredicatable every day.

With all of these advantages of not driving cars as much or at all, it would really help protect the worlds air, and could be a great source of exercise! Walking or riding your bike to wherever you need to go, or even just taking the city bus for two dollars. Also saving your money and spendind it on something else rather than wasting it on gas, or getting your car fixed. Or simply even buying a car, which can cost thousands of dollars.",0
"Many citizens in the United States rely on cars as a way of transportation. What they don't realize is that there are multiple options to consider instead of a car. ""Why consider a new method of transportation?,"" you may ask. If we limited the car usage we would have great amounts of advantages as a result.

One important result that would come if we limited car usage is having nearby store locations near by. "" In this new approach stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in a malls along some distant highway.""Source one: In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars paragraph six Limiting car usage will result in new buildings, stores, houses to become at a fair enough distance to walk.

If we had stores nearby enough to walk, there's no need of a car. If car usage reduces, the amount of walking, or riding a bike would increase. This will lead to a better life style. Recent studies has showed that walking daily can improve a persons mind. ""When I had car i was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" Source one: In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars paragraph three.

Another major positive affect that will result in reducing car usage is improving our atmosphere. One disadvantage cars cause, is air pollution. One example would be smog. The smog that we breath in is not good for our health.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""Source threeparagraph twentyfour. Not only if we reduce car usage we would gain positives outcomes but we would reduce pollution.

""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emmisons in Europe...and up to fifty percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Source one paragraph five. We would be doing positive thing for ourself but a positive thing for the environment.

Our generation does not need to rely on a piece of mechanic to take them to their destination. We have the ability to get to our route, and have other options that are helpful for us and for our environment. We have multiple advantages if we would consider to reduce car usage. So the question would be, why dont we stop using cars, and start helping ourself and our environment knowing the advantages we could be recieving in return.",0
"Life without cars may seem like a distant dream, but dreams are becoming a reality with new expiremental towns, banning of driving in some cities, and a national day without cars. Cars are causing, in some cases, more and more pollution everywhere. Although we ignore the signs of pollution everyday, we must face the fact that we are polluting our planet, and something needs to be done about it.

Vauban, Germany. A little city that has a strange law, to live in this city, you must give up your car or pay 40,000 to park it. As a result, ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here"" stated Source 1. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and a media trainer stated, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". This new form of separate suburban life from auto use is called ""Smart Planning"". passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. With Smart Planning, we can cut back on greenhouse gasses and start to breathe cleaner, healthier air.

Another example of over pollution problems due to cars is Paris, France. Source Two states, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". Congestion was down 60 percent for those five days. The reason there was so much smog in the air was due to the diesel fuel. Diesel fuel is the mail fuel used in France, 67 percent of the people there use it. Another factor could be the climate there. With ""cold nights and warm days caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Stated in Source Two.

Europe isn't the only continent seeing change. Bogota, Colombia was celebrating its 3rd straight year of, Day Without Cars. The Day Without Cars is a banning of cars and only busses and taxis are permitted. Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". For the first time this year, two more Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar are taking part in this Day Without Cars.

America too is seeing change with cars. The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005, but has been steadily dropping after. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the county was in January 1995"", states Source four. Although the drop in car usage will have a benificial effect on the environment, it will have negitave implications for car industries. Ford and Mercedes are already taking steps to rebrand themselves to ""mobility"" companies. Although car companies aren't the only ones changing their ways due to the drop in car usage. New York started a new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing. They have started building more bike paths and tunnel tolls are reflecting the new priorities.

Cars have done enough damage to this earth and its time we fix what we have caused. With all these new ecofriendly and car lacking ideas, we are so close to the isea where we can live without cars taking over our life.",0
"In the intense debate concerning the validity of the Electoral College process, it is difficult to choose a position. The Electoral College is a longstanding tradition created by the founding fathers in the early days of the United States. However, the reasons behind the adoption of the Electoral system are not as valid today as they were centuries before. Electoral College was proposed by the founding fathers due to the fact that the average American citizen in the beginning of our nation was a simple farmer, who was not educated enough to make an informed decision in a vote. Nowadays, things are different. General education of the public is very advanced, and there are various easily accessible forms of media from which to learn about the policies and positions of the presidential candidates. After all, the president's job is to care for and protect the people of America, not the politicians. Therefore, shouldn't the people, not the politicians, elect the president?

Even those who support the Electoral College must admit it is a confusing system. When a citizen votes for a presidential candidate, that vote really goes to a slate of electors who were selected by means that vary between states and are pledged to that particular candidate, and those electors then vote for the president. As pointed out in Bradford plumber's The Indefensible Electoral College , voters can't control who their electors vote for. additionally, ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"" also bradford . And Bradford makes a good point in the past, ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate"".

There is also the fact that candidates for the presidency often focus on ""swing states"", states whose majority is not decided between political parties and whose votes have a large impact on the election. This is due to the winnertakeall method of the Electoral College. In a state that is mostly Republican, a Democratic presidential candidate may not put much into the local campain, knowing that since most voters are against them they would probably lose the state and gain nothing, because all the electoral votes of a state go to the candidate who won the majority of voters in that state. Thus, presidential campains are focused in the swing states, giving little attention to the others. However, if the presidential election were decided by popular vote, campain efforts would be spread evenly across the United States since every voter everywhere counted in the final election.

The method of electing a president by popular vote is a fair and wellbalanced one, giving the minority parties in nonswing states a say in the presidency. Also, it was discovered that ""according to a Gallup poll in 2000...over 60 pecent of voters would prefer a direct election"" Bradford Plumer, . It was even admitted by proElectoral College Richard A. Posner in his Defense of the Electoral College that ""A tie in the national electoral vote is possible"" due to the even number of total votes. Posner also states that ""no voter's vote swings a national election"". However, if everyone believed that, noone would vote at all. Then there could be no election, Electoral College method or otherwise. Therefore, the individual voter does count, and so do all the minority political parties who's electoral slates do not get to vote for the president due to the Electoral College. Popular vote is the only reasonalble system for electing a president who will do their best for the American people. ""Of the people, for the people"". So let the all the people Vote.",0
"Life has revolved around driving since the termination of World War II. In sources 1 and 4, the authors mention the population's inhabitants have greatly reduced or stopped car usage wholly voluntarily. While in sources 2 and 3, the cities have banned car usage on certain days. The advantages of limiting car usage include less pollution and increased accessibility to the entire city.

Pollution is an large issue in todays world. According to Rosenthal in source 1, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States P5."" The use of cars has created smog in many large cities. The 2009 Olympics in Bejing required the city to reduce car usage in order to clear the air. Those participating and attending the event were in danger of harming their lungs. The citizens of Bejing has already been noted to wear respirators and other devices to filter the toxins from the air they breathe. In this extreme case, it was mandatory to cut the usage of cars down. But in other cities, they have not reached this extreme and it can be easily prevented by limiting car usage. Duffer mentions the pollution in the skies of the global city of Paris has been noticeably decreasedP19. In another scenario of pollution in the atmosphere, the city has taken initiative to ban cars depending on the number of their license plate. Without the emissions from the cars, the air would be clean to breath and a better sight as well.

The new generation has grown up with cars yet when the time comes to obtain a license, they forgo the opportunity. Selsky says that without cars, the city's parks and sports centers have been heavily visited. The pedestrian walkways and shopping centers have also came in large numbersP28. Due to the abandonment of cars, upscale commerce and new restaurants were constructed. Rather than a large mall near some interstate or other large roadway, shopping districts have transformed into locations in which are near public transportation or in walking distance. Rosenthal shares an anecdote that outlines that public transportation, carpooling, and even walking have replaced the car for himself and his childrenP40. Public transit is not viewed down upon anymore, it is a smarter way of getting from one place to another. Carpooling isn't a desprete call, it is a resource that has become essential and benificial to both parties. A combination of carpooling, walking, and public transit makes the city much easier to access and explore.

The development of cities is no longer based on cars. It is now be based upon the access it will give to those without cars. Limiting the use of cars makes the city improved in many ways. Clean air and more efficient ways of transportation highlights that cars are no longer needed and limiting car usage will have even more advantages in the future.",0
"What is the electoral college? The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes. The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.

To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections. This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Posner, ""There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast."" By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve runoff elections. What we dont know is if it will permanently work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these runoff elections. The writer notes, ""... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college..."" Posner. Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and one benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.

Moreover, the disaster factor has a huge impact on the electoral collage. The writer states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse"" Plumer. This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system. According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again. The writer also says, ""electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" Plumer. This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky. The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.

Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election. As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate's electors."" Office of the Federal Register. This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country. That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters"" as well as ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer. Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government. The writer also notes, ""candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" Plumer. This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government. Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?

All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.",0
"To the Senator of Florida, ""The founding fathers established... the Constitution"" to make sure that there was a way to vote for one elector to portray the role of President of the United States of America. However, this action has resulted in electors to lose even though they won the popular vote, the age of the electoral college, and there are numerous possibilities of ties. In the United States there are hundreds of millions of people who want to keep the United States a democracy, but the United States may change their stand point.

Popular votes are collected from the people of the United States. With stating this, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" This is because voters will be able to have only their votes taken into consideration. For example, the President of the United States is the official who sends people to places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran to fight for our country. These people vote for the elector they want to send them over seas instead of the politicians in the electoral college system voting for who they want to be the president. There are only 538 electors to vote for the elector they desire and that is still more important than the millions of people that vote. ""We are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" is a part of the Declaration of Independence and the right of liberty involves our right as people to vote.

The electoral college has be are for hundreds of years, but with the age of the system comes problems. In modern times, we have to make slight changes to our government so the United States does not get held back from when the Constitution was first created. Things are meant to change and so is the electoral college because over time thins changes to better and more efficient things. ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" This evidence exclaims that there was a problem with the electoral college 15 years ago, which means that it can happen again.

Furthermore, the electoral college already has problems and there can be more with the possibilities of a tie. It states, ""perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.,"" this is not a democratic thing because democracy has to do with the vote of people, not the vote of the legislature. Also, in source 2, it exclaims that ""the election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."" This is a dangerous situations because if a tie occurs the popular vote still won't be taken into consideration as much as the electoral votes.

To conclude, the electoral college system should be abolished because it does not benefit the citizens of the United States. The elecotral college takes away the popular vote of the people, is way too old to still be around, and there are possibilities of a tie. I don't want my President to be voted in based on the votes of the legislature.",0
"One uses a car to go to thee store, pick someone up, or even to go shopping, but what if people had no cars? Not having a car would have advantages.

"Many people carry out their daily life routine via car. Whether it is to drop their children off at school, or simply taking them to go to any sort of practice. Whichever the case, many find limiting car usage to be the answer to our problems.

One thing most people know is the amount of damage using a car can cause, especially to the environment. Air pollution has been a great factor into the problem as well as carbon emissions. For example, in Europe passenger cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50% in some car intensive areas across the areas in the United States. Congestion also plays into the problem. In France, there was an increase of smog in their cities, and diesel runned cars were to blame. As an outcome, the cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to cage in car emissions. With the limitation of car usage comes the decrease of toxic air roaming into our atmosphere, and an increase of a healthier lively one.

Besides the environmental effects car usage has had on us, there is also human effect. Many people around the world have participated in events in which they were to quit the car usage and were to find different methods of transportation, and the feedback was positive. In Vauban, Germany there is a resident of an upscale community whom had owned a car, but had decided to give it up. Heidrun Walkter, a mother of two, had once owned a car but now she walks the streets and is able to hear the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" The limit of car usage has also brought about more days of physical activity. In Bogota, Columbia, there were millions of Columbians who hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free day they had, in attempt to lower the smog in the air. In return, what the people got out of this day was both the decrease in smog, but also the decrease of stress. Not only did the day leave the capital city completely devoid of traffic jams but also brought many people closer with each other. As an example, a man riding a bicycle with his wife around the city, and says to say it was beneficial for both the environment and themselves.

Overall, the limitation of car usage has drastically decreased the amount of air pollution, and smog around the world. It has brought about the sound of children playing and the sound of people riding their bicycles. Many of the countries around the world participate in events to lower the harmful outcomes of the car usage from Germany to Paris, to Columbia and the United States, but there are still efforts in which they are present.",0
"Dear state senator, I urge you to vote in favor of changing to election by popular vote to select the president of the United States. I urge this to pass for three particular reasons. First is because of the factor that electors could defy the will of the people or the peoples word, Second is because of the event of a it would already be handed over to the House of representatives, and third is because of the winner takes all system.

To begin with the electors have and most likely will again defy the will of the people and the peoples word. For example, In The source The indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong. By: Bradford Plumer, He states that back in 1960 segregationists in the lousing legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who opposed president J.F.K. Likewise electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and vote for who ever they want.

Next, is the most worrying, the prospect of a tie in the votes of the Electoral College. If this were to happen the election would be decided by the House of representatives where the state delegations would vote on the president. Since each state only has one vote a representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 wouldn't have as much say as the reps. from California who represent near 35 million people. In 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted for the other side, only a few voters away from catastrophe.

And Finally, The Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner takes all system. in each state candidates dont spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning. They focus most of their time in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and Sotheren California. Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single ad. If anyone has a good argument to put their fate in presidency in the hands of a bunch of swing voters in Ohio, they are far away from the white house.

And once again state senator I urge your vote towards changing to election by popular vote to select the president of the United States. Because First, is the factor that electors could defy the will of the people or the peoples word, Second is because of the event of a tie it would already be handed over to the House of Representatives, and third is because of the unfair winner takes all system.",0
"Dear Senator, Good day, I am writing this letter to let you know it's time for things to change. I have been reading and researching the Electoral College and i have a strong opinion on it. As you know, the Electoral College is a process when all five hundred and thirty eight electors vote on electors and defenders. This way of voting for electors lets the people have no say in whose running our government! Our government should not allow or be based on ""the winner takes all"" method. When we choose for OUR president we should be able to choose OUR electors too! Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The electors shouldnt be chosen by the candidate's political party, we should choose. By voting for a president every four years a new party of electors have already been selected to run with him and we dont get any say. After the presidential election, your governor creates a list of all the candidates that ran for president in your state with a list of their representative electors. This is later sent to Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all agree that we need to remove and forget about the electoral college. This year our voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. Still the electoral college still has defenders fror themselves is crazy. Facts say voters arent actually voting for the president, but for a group of electors who in turn elect the president, and that is ridiculous. How are we supposed to trust these electors if we dont even know who they are and their background until after the election? Who even are these electors i wondered. I figured out that all the electors are actually anyone with a brain and not holding a public office, fantastic. So how do i know they are reliable and going to do whats best for my state and our country? Voters dont even control whom their electors vote for most of the time which is kind of scary. Some electors are even faithless in their party's candidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party?

As much as I hate to say it, there most definitley is an upside to the Electoral College. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in. Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Sometimes the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Another reason The Electoral College is a positive way of voting is how certain the outcome is. There is never failure in the counting of the votes and there us rarely a tie between two people. My favorite reason is because ""everybody is president"". This means everybody can make their own decisions and have a great amount of freedom.

Even though im all for removing the Electoral College there is positives too. In a few years when i am able to vote, i will be careful of who I vote for and make sure that there is great electors in the party i vote for.",0
"There are many fellow citizens in the world that have been using cars are having car accidents and many more terrible things that have happen during inside of a car or outside of a car. According to the passage, Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters. Is better to take a walk, ride a bike, and make the streets a better place. Especially, that up to 50 percent in the United States, there are carintensive areas. Car free day, was a big hit in Bogota, and should make it in the United States one day to leave the streets without traffic jams.

First, fellow citizens should stop the car usage, to make the streets a better place, walk, ride a bike, or do something that would make the streets much safer. The cars usage, many people have died for these terrible accidents. Limiting car usage, is a great idea, because it supports the streets to not become very dangerous. There are many accidents that have caused of a hitandrun. So is very important that at least the car usage should stop the humanity.

Next, Limiting car usage, is a great idea, because, according to the passage, up to 50 percent in the United States, there are carintensive areas. Carintensive areas, such as the traffic jam. Traffic jam, can be very dangerous at some point, and it keeps people very tired and frustrated. According to the article, In Bogota, Colombia, there's a program set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to keep the area as a carfree day, leaving the streets devoiding of traffic jams. So try to ride a bike, walk, skate, or do something, that can be a carfree day, a much safer environment.

Then, Limiting car usage, is a great idea, also, because without cars, and only buses and taxis, a which the main goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, Violators have faced 25 of fines, according to the article, also. Its a really good opportunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution from cars, especially the stress from traffic jams. As what i was saying in the beggining, that many people prefer to use bike, walk, or skate to keep themselves a much safer habit. If your driving, always put on the seatbelt to prevent from car accidents. Limiting car usage is a great way to prevent from all the car accidents out there in the world.

Last, Limiting car usage is a great way to the environment, makes the countries a better place. Having a carfree day, especially, is a much safer way to its environment. Ride a bike, walk, skate, or take a bus, if necessary, to prevent from all the car accidents out there in the world, it takes away the stress and decrease its air pollution from having a carfree day, and to promote from alternative transportation and reducing smog. Limiting car usage, is great way to our planet, but there is times that we need it for transporting to a place we want to go. Also, using a bike, walking, or skating is a great tool and excercise to our legs to keep our body maintained and healthy.",0
"The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is highly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people align themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush. The Electoral College should be kept in use because it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote.

To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election, but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions.

In addition, the Electoral College eliminates the unfair advantage of having a bigger state, allowing smaller states to have a significance in the election."" The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states advantage over them. People might claim that large states deserve more representation because more people live in them, but this doesn't preserve the equality for other smaller statess citizens that the United States stands for. This makes it apparent that without the Electoral College only the ""big states"" would matter and the candidates wouldn't have to worry about the small states.

Finally, the Electoral College does its best to eliminate the issue of not being able to determine the winner when the majority vote does not differ. "" Most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This stops the problem that occured in 1968 with Nixon and 1992 with Clinton, and provides a clear definite way to choose the winner. If the Electoral College wasn't in use, lengthy recounts and much controversy would follow elections to try to determine if the votes were fair this would cause too much strife and unrest within the country. It can be argued that even with the conflict it provides the people a chance to make their votes count, but it does more harm than good and it doesn't truly change anything. As a result, the Electoral College solves the issue of uncertainty and significance of vote.

In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.",0
"The reduction or limited usage of cars impacts the daily lifes of society and also benefits the environment It could also Change the way you see things.

Limiting the usage of cars can reduce the pollution in the air caused by cars and motorists.

Around the world people have a different way of thinking when it comes to cars, Society has come to realize that car usage is becoming dangerous & unnecessary. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". In colombia People have decided to change the routine of driving everywhere in cars because it might be unnecessary since their destinations might be close instead they reduced the transportation usage and only buses are permitted it lowers the pollution in the air. This demonstrates that a campaign of limiting the car usage should begin in other countries.

In Germany People have founded other ways to limit the car usage instead of banning cars. Society decided to make the streets more compact less far away from the community itself. ""Make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation with, less space for parking, stores are placed a walk away on a main street"" By doing this action it takes pressure away for people who use their cars everyday to drive anywhere. It also saves people money by not spending on gas & most importantly it encourages people to walk and exercise by doing simple things like shopping. It also psychologicaly impacts community members. "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".

There's many others ways of influencing people to not use cars. For example, making a national fine. Like the government in France made "" License plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine"".

Driving less could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, It will allow people to feel more free and less stressed and it also allow them to meet new friends, their could health become better The economy could rise, traffic will be cut. There would also be less car accidents and crashes due to less traffic.",0
"The automobile was made a long time ago to help us move around faster and more efficient,however,have we really thought about the benefits that could come from limiting the usage of cars such as:Saving money in gas and insurance,Less car crash related injuries and even because its better for the environment.

With limiting the usage of cars comes many pro's such as saving money. On average,an American spends about thirtyfive to forty dollars on gas per fillup and one hundred to two hundred dollars a month on insurance a month depending on age,experience,accidents,etc. By limiting your car usage completely or even just a little just imagine the extra money you'll have laying around for the nessecities and maybe even a ittle youtime. Say you buy a bike and the only time you use your car is to drive to work and anywhere outofstate,that means that you'll be able to go a week with roughly two gallons of gas. That puts you at about thirtyeight hundred dollars a year where if you were purchasing four or five gallons a week you'd be spending approximately eleven thousand dollars a year. Thats no chump change. You're insurance would gradually decrease due to safe driving and age so along with gas being cheaper,so would the insurance.

Florida is a state wellknown for car crashes due to weather conditions like rain and fog and you can't do anything to change that other than take a different,much safer mode of transportation such as a bus. Nowadays bus and semitruck drivers are more experienced and cautious then they used to for one reason,CYBCover your Butt.You see major bus and semitruck companies now that due to the size of their vehicles,if there's ever crash involving one of their automobiles then they're likely to get blamed cause of the size of the vehicles and so it would make since for them to send their drivers to extensive training and make sure that their trucks are in good hands,which is exactly what they do. Studies show that you're chances of being in a wreck in a bus are one of every one hundred rides while being in a car driven by yourself puts you at a whopping one of ten ridesyur chances of safety are greatly increased.

The United States of America has no shortage of pollution and that's not helped by the fact that we have one of the largest populations of personal automobiles inhabiting this country. There are many other kinds of pollution that occurrs in the land of the free but most of it like factory smoke,large shipboatsmoke and even resturant made smoke can not really be stopped or diminished by you or me but one form of pollution we can prevent is automobile smoke. In the US up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas is from carscertain areas.If you stop using you car and ride a bike even thugh it won't seem like muchyou'd be suprised at the difference. Say a sall cmmunity around yur neighborhood gives up their cars that could account for half a percent of greenhouse gas which is more than it seems. Just ask yourself if you want your friends and family growing up in a dying,polluted world.

In conclusion,I'm not discrediting the huge help cars can be in our daily lives I'm just slaying if we continue along this carorientated path,pollution may be what ends our daily lives.",0
"The Electoral College has been around for many years. It is not an actual college, or location. It is a process where American citizens select their electors, however proceeding that the electors make their votes for President and Vice President Congress counts for electoral votes. But, the Electoral College is a very controversial process, many people are for it, but many are also against it. Some even wanting to get rid of the Electoral College overall. We should ban the Electoral College for it does not satisfy American people.

Electors in the Electoral College can vote for whomever they want, giving American people the wrong idea and vote for the wrong presidential candidate. In the article source 2 ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This quote from the article shows that not always can the American people be guaranteed who their electors vote for, and electors can give voters the wrong information and vote for the opposing candidate. This would be going against American people, dissatisfying them. In the article source 3 by Richard A. Posner it states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" American people can be confused, infused with the wrong information by Electors, and vote for a candidate that has no interest in carrying their state.

Larger states get more attention than the smaller states due to their high number of electoral votes. In the article source 3 by Richard A. Posner it says, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Obama had won 29 electoral votes in Florida high number due to him making speeches and campaigns throughout the state. Paying his upmost attention to that state due to the high number of electoral votes he was trying to gain. Whereas in a smaller state such as Wyoming, he would not want to waste time paying much attention there where he can only gain 3 electoral votes! This is simply unfair and at most dissatisfying for the citizens who live in the smaller states with low electoral votes such as Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, etc.

The Electoral College has been around for a long time, and in the end we DO receive a president in the end. But, imagine if this unfairness keeps going every four years an election happens. American people not being guaranteed their candidate, smaller states not getting as much campaign as the larger ones, etc. We do though, receive a president in the end. But what if it's a president that we do not want? That we were not fairly given? Just look at what happened with George Bush! There are many simple advantages to the Electoral College, but there are also many concerns that can outnumber.

The Electoral College should be gotten rid of because of how unfair it is to American citizens. If the issues with the Electoral College are not taken care of in the present, just imagine what our future elections will be like. Us American people need to take a stand against the Electoral College, and the process involved. Once a new popular process is created and introduced, it can provide us more justice and fairness than the Electoral College.",0
"12% of all green house gas in Europe is from is from car emissions and up to 50% in the United States. The earth needs a change while it still can. Theres already many countries that are trying to do something, France the U.S. and Colombia just to name a few. Taking a break and not driving cars has so many pros and very little cons. Yes, you might have to walk and might lose some weight but it may decide how much longer humans can stay on earth.

What comes out of your car, that's what you are breathing. Would you rather breath burn gasoline fumes or fresh clean air? Its your choice, every year billions of people driving cars that are releasing a gas ,CO2, into the air which is poisonous to humans. What happens after the world gets full of it? I honestly don't want to see.

Not only is car pooling and taking public transportation cheaper that paying for gas but it also helps keep the green house gasses down more that if everyone was driving. A recent study by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives shows that more Americans are driving less cars every year. Join your fellow Americans, you won't regret it.

Soon enough cars are going to get banned and fines will be put in place that are given to people who drive gas powered cars. Do you really want this to happen? People getting fined just because they had to go to work or to see there family? I'm pretty sure you o don't, so lets make the world a little more car free. Then thus make the world CO2 free.

Now there's a relatively new car that runs on electric. Although these cars are not exactly cheap, but they are motorless and gasless and they don't release CO2 into the atmosphere and they look nice too. If that doen't suit you there is a hydrogen powered car coming out in 2015. If you dont think you can handle that then there is always busses, taxis and bikes. Then if you still can't find something you like there's walking, humans where built with legs, use them.

Think about how you want your children and there children to live there lifes and how you and the rest of the earth can effect them and how you can keep there lifes free of poisonus CO2. Consider the walk or bus ride and maybe even investing in an electric car or a bycicle.",0
"Dear senator, I wanted to write you this letter to say that we should keep the electoral college. Because they tally the votes fair to elect the government and president that the people of this powerful country have elected to be their leader. The electoral college was one of the rules that our founding fathers made for our country which has kept our country strong in the past so why would we want to take away that cause that would be like erasing our country past and our fathers rule. The electoral college consists of 538 electors for the electoral college so if we take away this process cause its not a place then we are putting 538 people out of a job.

First things First, we should keep the electoral college cause it is a great process that lets our people choose a leader of this brave and powerful country fairly by having the electors read the votes and tally them up and pick the leader the most people voted for but sometimes its not the most cause if bigger states with more powerful people vote for a different president and the one president has the most votes but if the other one has the more votes from bigger states and cities like california then he gets the popular vote. The electoral college has never technically failed us it has gotten close in the John F. Kennedy election when state legislators were technically responsible for picking electors and that the electors could defy the will of the people so say like if John F. Kennedy got the popular vote then it could possibly not go to him cause the electors could get replaced with new ones that could oppose him. The mistakes were never to the point that it messed up our country just little mistakes that got fixed by a direct election which we have now a day so that these little mistakes cant mess our whole voting system up. We should keep the electoral college because it is proven that people have out voted electors in the Gore as Bush election cause Bush got the electoral votes but Gore got the popular vote by the people.

Second of All, we should keep the electoral college because it was one of our founding fathers rules and processes and they were the people who founded and discovered this brave, powerful, and beutifal country so if we throw that away then we are betraying our fathers and our ancestors. Another thing is electoral college has of america and they aint running for president and they are aloud to vote which is fair cause it's everyones president not just only the people not apart of the constitution. The great rule that our constitution made for the electoral college was the malapportionment which means even if the large states has a bigger population they still could lose by virtue so if we dont have an electoral college that will not be possible then we would just get out voted by heavier states and electors. The electoral college is a great process for fair voting for our government and president and if we keep that running then we keep our country running as a healthy country.

To Wrap it up, I think we should keep our electoral college for many of reasons. one because its the fairest most strongest process of voting. two because it lets everybody vote including the electors. and last but not least it keeps our founding fathers rule going and keeps us loyal to our brave and powerful country leader.",0
"Limiting the use of cars seems like a crazy idea but if you really think about the importance of cars now a days does not seem like a big deal. People are starting to realize that cars are not the only way of transportation. According to the article, the number of people driving tend to decrease every yearSource 4 S4 paragraph 41 P41 . On the other hand driving can be more beneficial than walking or riding a bike at times. The purpose of the essay is to explain the advantages of limiting car usage.

For all you nature lovers, limiting cars would seem like a good idea. If more people walk or ride bike's, the percent of air pollution would lowerS1 P5. In the United States, it is proven that up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas is caused by carsS1 P5. Cars can be very dangerous if they are driven by the wrong people. Driving under the influence can cause many accidents because drivers tend to go to fast or drive really reckless while intoxicated.

Choosing to walk or ride a bike instead of driving can be more beneficial because of the amount of exercise people can get out of it. One con to driving is having to worry about trafficS3 P20. When not driving you do not have to worry about anything slowing you down. There are many advantages to walking instead of driving that many people do not realize. For example, when walking you do not have to deal with bad parking, being fined for bad driving, or even washing your car which can be a hassle at timesS3 P21.

On the hand, there is nothing wrong with driving at times. A car can be more useful than walking when it comes to going long distances. Now a days everybody is always in a rush and based on where you need to go a car can get there at a faster rate. Accidents can still happen while walking or riding a bike just maybe not as frequently. People can even use smart cars if they are so worried about air pollutionS2 P18.

To wrap things and get to the point, driving less cars can be more beneficial. Walking and riding bike's and avoid less traffic and accidents. The percent of greenhouse gas caused by cars would probably go down and air pollution would not be such a big problem. Another benefit of walking is getting exercise. While cars do cause many problems as far as pollution and accidents, they are not a bad idea.",0
"Dear Senator, The Presidential election is one of America's proudest accomplishments. It sets the United States apart from other countries and brings great pride to the people. As the United States grows older and wiser, it learns more than what the original Founding Fathers knew. One of their the Founding Fathers great contributions to this country is the electoral Congress. This process is still being used today. Based on the positive and negative aspects this system, the electoral Congress should remain the way Americans elect government leaders.

The major goal of elections is to choose a leader in a mythotical and smooth way. The electoral Congress brings a ""landslide electoralvote victory in that state."" source 3, paragraph 18 This gives the public a reasurrence that their state was strong and sure about the decision. This comfort might not come if the elections were popularvote based only. Also, ""the electoral College requires a presidential to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president"" source 3, paragraph 19 It's important to have a system that doesn't allow one region to dominate over the others. Had this been the case, the balance among the people would be completely thrown off.

Of course, there are drawbacks to this system. There are a good number of people who believe this is not a democratic way of having their voices be heard. source 3, paragraph 15 Along with that, close calls such as ties have shown to strain the current voting system. source 2, paragraph 11 However, these are rare cases and when they presented themselves, the leaders of the country were able to fix the issue in a way that appeased most. This current process does give some states power to tip the scales while others are locked in on their canadates before the voting begins. source 2 paragraph 13 But the results over the past years have shown no party has an unfair advantage over the others. America has had both many democrats and republicans in office.

Based off of the current solutions to the electoral Congress, for the timebeing, remaining the same would be in the best interest of the nation. It is acknowleged that the people are voting for a slate of electors and not the actual canadate. But the voters who know United States elections are about ""expressing their political prefernces"" source 3, paragraph 23 are accomidated nicely and reassured of the current process. The peoples' opinions are well represented in the use of this system and until it poses an unsolvable, catastriphical problem, there is no need to abolish it.",0
"We live in a world where we rely on cars to get us to where we need to and want to be. Be it to work, school, errands, dates, family get together, hanging out with friends and a multitude of other things. Yet do we really need cars like we think we do, some would say yes or how else are we suppose to get around to places we have to go but when you think about it not really since there are other ways to get around like walking or taking public transportation. Their are even some advantages to just stop using cars altogether.

Many people now a days worry a lot about the environment specifically the negative things that have been done to it like how green house gasses are destroying the ozone layer. It makes the earth more exposed to the sun's radiation and causing a negative chain of events like the polar ice caps melting. According to source one ""In Germen suburb life goes on without cars"" its revealed that cars account for twelve percent of green house gasses in Europe and fifty percent of green house gasses in the United states. This is especially problematic in large dense cities where car green house gasses add to the pollution by mixing in with other green house gasses from other parts of these cities. In source two ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", cars are the cause of the terrible smog problem Paris is facing which causes many driving problems. If we stop using cars we immediately cut down on how much green house gas gets released into the ozone layer. It would not only be good for us but good for the environment as well.

On a more personal note, in all honesty driving a car is incredibly stressful. There are rushhour restrictions which cause massive traffic jams, it's sometimes hard to find parking pace, gas costs an arm and a leg most of the time and accidents can be caused by the simplest mistakes. Wouldn't it be more peaceful and more enjoyable to walk somewhere on a nice day or take a bus with your family to the beach so you can all interact more with each other and not have one person busy focusing on the road. In source 4 ""The end of Car culture"" a study was conducted and it was seen that in the United States the number of miles driven peaked in 2005 and it has been dropping steadily. Aren't you getting tired of driving now especially with all the stress that comes with it be it gas prices, traffic, accidents and driving rules and regulations. Is a car really worth the time and expierence of headaches and pains from driving?

A big reason people use cars is to get in touch or communicate with friends or family. At least that use to be a big reason. Many used to have to drive many miles or many hours to see or meet a particular person. Now with inventions such as the cell phone and the internet specifically things like facebook, skype and twitter many can talk with their family and friends across any distance and in some cases feel more connect as stated by Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel university in source four ""The end of Car culture."" Yet if you want to go out still there's always the option of biking, walking or a public transportation such as taxi, shared van services and buses. There are many ways to communicate in this day and age and cars are slowly becoming an fading option While at first the idea of stopping the use of automoblies may seem stupid and could cause many to have a kneejerk reaction their are actually many advantages to not usuing cars anymore. In fact in might even be the best thing to stop using cars and just enjoy a stressfree environmentally healthy life with the people you love.",0
"Cars. Trucks. motorcycles. All these forms of transportation are drastically poluting the air due to the release of gas emission from the tailpipe. Some may say it's easier to get around with a car handy. Others believe too many people are centered on a car. Cities should become denser for the public in order to transport and reduce gas emission at the same time.

Up to 50% of car intensive areas are poluted in the United States as well as 12% in Europe. driving isn't the only way to get around. In Vauban, Germany some in the community have taken the pledge to give up their cars and go green. In result to doing this, locations like garages are generally not used to hold a four wheel vehicle anymore. Instead this ""car free"" area is encouraging those to join the 70% of vaughn's population to say goodbye to the waste product. In addition to a ""car free"" zone comes ""smart planning"". This is the practice of separating the suburban life from auto use. In other words, creating a more condensed community will ensure more walkers instead of drivers.

Similar to both the US and Germany, many areas have committed to giving up the cars. In Paris, pollution had gotten so bad they almost hit a record! Depending on the even or odd number license plate along with the day that came with it, people were ordered to leave their car andor motor vehicle home or pay a 22euro fine. Pollution was down 60% in France after the period of time enforcing the rule. In Bogota, Colombia most chose to walk, bike, skate, or take a bus to get around, leaving the city barren of any to no vehicles. With a capital of 7 million a goal was reached reducing smog throughout the city. Violators paid the price of 25 fines.

Other research may suggest that leaving the cars home decreases some ability to get around at a decent time or may even cost just as expensive. Having somewhere to be and knowing you have to be their can be a haste prioritizing your time. You have to calculate when you leave from both your home and the destination. Those who live in big cities will struggle even more from time to time. If cars on the street are limitted to taxis then the cost to get to a location will be as similar to that of a gas bill. Not only that but areas will require more taxi services to fill those needs of the people.

Vehicles, the deathly poison of the human race, will continue to pollute the area unless something is done. Many areas have taken the step to create more suitible living conditions of the human race. Globally, we are reducing the exposure of gas emission everywhere. Continuing this will ensure a heallthy present and furture for years to come.",0
"Dear Mr. Florida State Senator, My name is PROPER_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME in LOCATION_NAME, and I am writing to you addressing a matter that I have witnessed being discussed, come every four years presidential election time: the Electoral College. I am in favor of abolishing the Electoral College and changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The method of electing our president should be changed to election by popular vote because the Electoral College is unfair, problematic, and does not represent the will of our citizens accurately.

First of all, the Electoral College is unfair. Because many states are ""set"" Republican or Democrat, it seems like only the votes in ""swing states"" seem to matter. According to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong ,""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""So, it seems that, in this system of election, only the swing states matter in voting. Though the focused campaigning is necessary in the process of the Electoral College, it would not be necessary if the voting system was by popular vote. This is unfair because it puts potential voters in the dark about what's going on. Also, Democrats in ""Republican"" states or vice versa cannot hope for them to help their preferred presidential candidate, as mentioned in In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President.

Secondly, the Electoral College is problematic. There is much uncertainty with the Electoral College. As What Is the Electoral College states, we vote for electors to vote for the President and Vice President. According to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , ""The electorscan be anyone not holding public office...sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" The electors may not vote for who the people wanted. An example of this would be in the presidential election of 1960. Also according to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , ""...segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors.""paragraph 11 If they had succeded, it would have meant a longer period of intense segregation and racism, which we are still fighting to this day. Another reason that the Electoral College is problematic is in a case of a tie in the electoral vote. Then, more steps are required to figure out who's president.

Lastly, the Electoral College does not represent the citizens of the United States accurately. Many reasons support this claim. I think political parties are similar to ""cliques"" in school. People in cliques act in a certain way, dress in a certain way, only think that how they do things is right, etc. Political parties are similar. If you pick a political party to identify as, you're either ""prolife"" or ""prochoice"". You're either for something or against something. There's not really an inbetween. In In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , author Richard A. Posner says that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...""paragraph 23. Presidential candidates that don't identify with a certain party don't have much of a chance to win at all, even if they might turn out to be what's best for our country. I don't think there should be a vote for ""political preference"", but that's another arguement. Voters should vote for who they want to represent their country with flexible decisions, not a set cookiecutter description, like a clique in school.

In conclusion, I believe we should abolish the Electoral College and put in place a new system of voting. The process of voting should be changed to the poplular vote because the Electoral College is unfair, uncertainly problematic, and an inaccurate form of representation. We all want what's best for the country, right? So, this is how I think we should make our country better. My voice may not be much, but it only takes one to start a movement. Please consider my voice, and it could be a step to making our country the best it can be.",0
"Dear state senator, Hello my name is PROPER_NAME and I am writing to you about our voting system. Many individuals are not content with the Electoral College and many are. You could see both sides, but that does not mean we should switch to election by popular vote. Here are a few reasons on why the Electoral College method is the way to go.

During election by popular vote there is a great chance that there could be a ""tie"". A tie would cause a great set back in the voting process due to the fact that there would have to be more votes cast or even longer campaigns. In the Electoral College system we don't have to worry about things like that happening. Yes, disputes are possible, but they are very rare. As stated in article three under the headline certainty of outcome, the reason for very few disputes is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote. It is highly unlikely for a tie to occur.

Article three line twentytwo reads "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."". One example of this is in 1968 Nixon only had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, but won the majority in the Electoral College. Another example is in 1992 when Clinton also only had 43 percent of popular vote but majority in the Electoral College. Source three line twentythree states "" It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.."". This is true but the Electoral College is still more efficient due to the fact there are rarely ever any ties.

The Electoral College eliminates the power of a large population, everything is equal. The winnertakeall method induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. Voters in the toss up states are likely to be te most thoughtful, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. The case in the popular vote method is very different.

Over all you can see that the Electoral College method is the way to go. There are les bumps in the road and it is very efficient. There are rarely any ties, everything is fair, and it avoids runoff elections. We should not switch to the popular vote method.",0
"All throughout the world, experiments are taking place that replace the personal automobile with safer and more environment sensitive choices. Life in places, such as Vauban, Germany, is built around the lack of cars. Bogota, Colombia hosts their own Day Without Cars. Although this scale of events hasn't happened America yet, the youth of the United States aren't using cars as much as they used to. In all these cases, quality of life has improved and the environment isn't suffering as much as it previously did.

The residents of Vauban, Germany have made a monumental decision in the aspect of cars. According to the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , in the new district of Freiburg, the only cars that run in the streets are the trams that run to downtown Freiburg. This is done so that ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" This ""smart planning"" allows people to get to where they need to go without using cars. Placing busy businesses on a main street would normally be a bad idea because of the amount of congestion it would cause. In places like this, congestion isn't a thing that can happen. A walk could get you to central places allowing you to access the more important of places. The same article states that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emitions."" The environment is in a state of constant decline with the amount of greenhouse gasses and chemicals we are exposing to it. The lack of cars is a great way to put us in the right direction. The article mentions that cars were responsible for ""up to 50 percent of greenhouse gasses in some carintensive ares in the United States."" Imagine how much clearer the sky would be with smog reduced by half. The implications of removing cars from our lives could mean the difference between severe global warming and living happy and healthy.

Three cities, deep within the Colombian urban areas, host a day where cars are not allowed. Andrew Selsky describes how ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven,pitted sidewalks rushhour traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" In Bogota, this singular day where cars were banned gave people a reason to try out public transportation and personal locomotion. Paris took a similar approach when, According to Robert Duffer, they ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of he global city."" Cars with evennumbered license plates were enforced to not be driven. The oddnumbered plates were the ones that were taken off the streets the next day. The two day ban allowed the environment to recover after extremely high smog levels. The rule that was applied in the Colombian cities was also enforced in the worldwide city of Paris. Both cities benefited greatly from a temporary ban of cars.

Car culture has always been strong within America. Elisabeth Rosunthal implies that for several decades, cars were a musthave object, but now, the youth are not as interested as the previous generations. Rosunthal shows how ""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miled driven in the United States peaked in 200 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspecive."" If the largest cities stopped relying on cars as much, everybody would benefit. Even the car companies would have something to gain with advances in more personal vehicles such as bicycles. The environment would have an immense amount of weight taken off of its shoulders. In the US, where the 2nd highest source of environmental harm is cars, the impact would be monumental. The article relates that ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume hte habit."" Teens all across America are carpooling and finding new ways to help the environment while also getting to where they need to go.

Life is getting too busy. There is always something that needs to be done. Cars may help but there will never be enough hours in the day to do everything. Leaving personal transportation behind will be the next big step towards a more relaxed and stressless life. The advantages easily outweigh the disadvantages.",0
"It is often said that ""change is good."" This saying is one way to describe my feelings towards the Electoral College. The sources ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner show the pros and cons of the Electoral College. The Electoral College should be taken over by popular votes because all Americans should have a say in who their next leader will be.

The Electoral Collegemay disregard what their voters say and vote for another candidate to be our next President. In paragraph 11 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it is declared that ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate."" Voting citizens of America vote for a reason. They vote for who they want to be President, not who the party's electives want to be President. Voters should be able to trust their electors, otherwise their votes are going to a candidate they voted against. Another key point of this unjust way of voting is that people have to put their trust into unknown electors. It is stated in paragraph 16 of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner ""each of the party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."" These electors may be ""trusted"", but to the unknowing voters of America they are ordinary people who could betray someone very easily. All it takes is one elector disobeying his promise to the candidate he chose to represent to have the fate of American changed.

The winner of the election may lose by popular vote and win by electoral votes. This is an unfair advantage that the Electoral College has to the common voters. Voters expect to vote for who they selected, not who the Electoral College selects. It is emphasized in paragraph 10 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer in which ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" In simpler terms, this is saying you don't vote for the next leader, you vote for people who may choose the next leader. The people of America vote for a reason, to choose our next leader who will support our country. They don't vote to have a College of unknown Electors choose the next President. It should also be noted that you're technically not even voting for a President. It is disputed in paragraph sixof ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" In other words, you don't even choose your candidate, just people who are trusted to vote for them. American voterswant to for the nex president, not a board of Electors that they are unsure will trust them.

On the contrary, there is the possibility of it being a very close election where it would require the Electoral College to choose a President. In paragraph 18 of the source ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""Richard A. Posnerstates ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The popular vote might be back and forth between the Presidents, but an electoral vote would create more of a landslide win. In the end, the cons of the Electoral College outweigh the pros of it.

The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing our country's next leader. The change of this ancient voting would be a very good and appreciatef one.If America really let the people of America choose, they would let the popular vote be the deciding factor for our next President of the United States.",0
"To begin with, the Electoral College should be kept. It's a important process to be able to select the electors and the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President. One's of the many reason they should keep the Electoral College is because the voters want to express their political preference. Also, it helps choose your state's electors when you vote. Lastly, voters won't get confused about the electors when they vote for the candidate with this process, they wont.

startingg of with, some people might argue that one vote won't affect the voting and that it does not express your political preference. However, in source three by Richard A. Posner paragraph twenty three states ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference."" People who vote in elections are people who want a change to be made. They give their vote for the strongest and most confident candidate. They don't get mistaken in whom they've voted for.

To continue, Every given time there is a presidential election which is our responsibility to vote in and help choose our state electors. In source one by the Office of the Federal Register says ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President"" When we decide who our vote goes to we usually help choose our states electors when we vote for President and when we vote for our candidate we are also voting for our candidate's electors which most people will agrue is the right way to go.

Last but not least, many people would argue that voters get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. In source two by bradford Plumer says ""...voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate."" However, it has been proven that mostly everyone does choose for the right candidate! They choose the candidate they see the post potential and confidence in and the one that is going to make the changes they want and need.

To conclude, Electoral College should be kept. Multiple people will agree to this as well. This isn't just a place its a process that people agree to do! This makes us able to elect the most confident candidate that is going to make a powerful change. There are many reason the Electoral College should be kept. starting of with, the voters and how they want to express their political prefence. Also, it helps us choose our state's electors when we vote. Lastly, voters won't get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate with this process. This is a long process but at the end of the day is worth it.",0
"Having ""electors"" vote for us from the electoral college is basically giving us, the people, no say into what we president we want. Why ask us the people to vote when you have someone or others to chose what they think we want for president? Changing the from electoral college voting to the popular vote can give us the people a voice for what we want and think is best for this country and it gives us a reason to vote. If we still electoral college voting then our voice as a country is not being heard.

Giving us a voice in this country that we live in an enormous opportunity than what other countries around the world do not have the privilege to have. Giving us, the people, a voice brings us together as a country and it unifies us. It also means that not only do we have government power but we have people power as a whole. Bradford Plumer from source 2 explains to us in his first subtitle what is wrong withe the electoral college and he states that ""When you vote, you are not voting for the president, you are voting for a slate of electors, who then for the president of their choice."" That was an example of our people not having a voice because we are basically wasting our time voting because at the end of the day the slate of electors are the ones who end up chosing who they want as president. Why should we vote when our vote doesn't even matter?

Moreover, I feel that us voting is a waste of our time because of this winnertakesall method that Bradford Plumer states in the fifth paragraph of his article titled: The Indefensible Electoral College. The winnertakesall method is when presidents travel to specific states in which they believe they would win in the electoral votes and some states do not get visited at all by neither of the candidates because the candidates do not feel like they would win their votes. I understand that the electoral college is a process in which was founded by our founding fathers and established it into our constitution so that there is a compromise between election of the presodent by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens Source 1. It is not really a compromise when you have a system in which a president can win the popular vote by 99 percent of the people but still lose by the electoral college because we basically have no say in the election.

On a final note, the electoral college system is a unfair way of our countries presidents to be elected when we also have the votes of the people which have no effect on which canidate wins. Although, our founding fathers thought this was a terrific idea at the time of making this part of the constitution, in reality we have a much larger population today than they did in the past when they had made the constitution. Having have all these people in our country vote today for a canidate and later have the vote not take any effect which canidate should win is very unfair. I can understand the electoral college system working back then when it was first made because the population was still relatively minimal but now we must abolish it because the points that some electoral vote colleges get is very small compared to some other states. How would you feel if you were a canidate and got 99.",0
"Dear Senator, I know that you have many issues to think about and have a lot of decisions to make, but I think it the subject of the Electoral College is a very important subject for you to ponder. The Electoral College needs to be changed, we need to vote for the presidency with the popular vote. I believe that the Electoral college needs to be taken away because it's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.

First, the Electoral College should be changed because it is not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College. The people ar voting for the president, but not really. They are actually voting for a slate of electors, who then choose what candidate there electoral votes should go to. The whole point of a democracy is to let the people of the country have a say in who is in charge, but with the Electoral College this is not happening. The people are saying who they want for president but if the slate of electors does not agree, then the votes go the other way. This was expressed in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer. In the passage he says, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes."" In addition, the Electoral College should be abolished because the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate. The Legislature is technically responsible for picking electors and theywould very well pick electors that are all against a certain candidate. Everyone says the system is so strong but is it really? The fact that a group of people opposing one candidate could be the electors for that state and could totally changed the votes doesn't make the system look so strong. Plummer adressed this situation in his passage, he stated, ""Back in 1960, segregationista in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors wiht new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. so that the popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy."" Finally, the Electoral college system needs to be taken away because it is very confusing. The whole system is just a jumble of different things. There are so many different steps and processes that tend to confuse the voters. When the voters get confused they often end up voting for the wrong candidate or making a mistake. If the voting system was just, the voters voted for who they pleased, then the votes were counted, then all the votes from states are added together, and then whoever had the most votes won, the whole thing would just be much easier. I belive that when the situation is as impportant as voting for our president, it should be as easy and flawless as possible. For example, when I was in seventh grade, I learned about the Electoral College in civics class. learing about the Electoral College was one of the hardest and most complicated thing I learned that year. How are people supossed to vote, if they have no idea how the system works?

In conclusion, I believe that the electoral college needs to be abolished becauseit's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.",0
"The Electoral College basically serves as a filter for the votes of every individual American citizen. Every single vote that comes from citizens is a vote for somebody else who will be voting for the president, not the candidates themselves. The Electoral College is flawed to the point where the most logical way to vote would be to base presidential elections off of popular votes.

The Electoral College encourages the presidents who are running for office to avoid campaigning towards states with a smaller amount of electoral voters. If the president is determined by the most electoral votes, it would make sense that the president would campaign towards larger states with more electoral voters such as California, Texas, and Florida. Why would they spend time trying to appeal to some of the smaller states? This can lead to some states not even seeing the candidate. Infact, during the 2000 election, voters in the 25 largest media markets did not witness any campaign advertising.

The Electoral College's process of voting suppresses the voice of every citizen. The balance between smaller and larger states comes into play here as well. Take Florida for example, a state with 29 total electoral votes. If the mass majority of Florida votes for a certain set of electors, the minority votes for the other ones would not matter at all, as the electors speaking for that certain fraction of the population would not elected. With popular voting, each and every vote would matter towards electing a president. The number of minority votes would directly apply to the outcome of the president.

The Electoral College and the electors should not be the voice of the country. The voice of the people should be heard, especially when it comes to presidential elections. Popular voting is the most fair and rational method of voting. The Electoral College is best off forgotten as a voting system.",0
"Cars are an essential part of life they get us from place A to place B, but so do bikes, buses, trains, and your very own feet. In Vauban, Germany, residents have gone where few soccer moms or communting executives have ever gone: they have given up there cars. ""Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers."" Rosenthal 1 In a world filled with pollution, stressed adults, and unhealthy people the advantages of limiting car usage are infinite.

Limiting car usage in the world would most definitely reduce the amount of pollution that is ruining our ozone layer. If it wasn't for the ozone layer humans would be long gone and wouldn't come back any time soon. In Paris, France, the government enforced a partial driving ban because of the nearrecord pollution. ""On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" Duffer, 11 After five days of partial driving, congestion was down an incredible 60 percent. What if after five days they kept going? The city would look and feel brand knew and it would be safe for citizens to breathe the air. Similarily, our very own President Obama is trying to curb the United states greenhouse gas emissions. "" As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" Rosenthal 32 This means that people are choosing better ways to get from place A to place B, and if this trend persists "".. it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment..."" Rosenthal 34 As you can see, there is hard evidence that limiting car usage in the world would reduce the amount of pollution.

Furthermore, limiting car usage would help to relieve the stress of our everyday lives. How much traffic will there be? Am I going to get to work on time? Oh my god, I am out of gas and I passed the nearest gas station? Heidrun Walter, a citizen of the carfree Vauban, Germany, says,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Also, the stress levels of adults get higher when they become parents who have children driving. I know my mom doesn't sit through a full car ride with me without stomping on her imaginary brakes. But, it seems to be that, ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license.."" Rosenthal 38 Moreover, even one day without driving makes the Columbians in Bogota, Columbia, less stressed and more relaxed. Business man Carlos Arturo Plaza rode a twoseat bicycle wih his wife to work that day. He says, "" It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower airpollution."" Selsky 24 Limiting car usage, like these small cities have done, helped to relieve stress of their citizens which is why it is a huge advantage.

Lastly, limiting car usage would better the well being of our fellow citizens. Imagine, a business man who works in an office for 10 hours and then gets home just in time to eat and catch a few hours of quality television. When does this man have time to exercise? He sits in his car, sits at work, sits to eat, and sits to watch tv. If we limited car usage, this man would have to ride his bike or walk to the bus stop to get to work everyday, which is good for his health. Similarily, we have children who spend more time in front of a computer screen than playing outside like children should. But, what parent would let there kids play outside when there's tons of cars on the road? In Vauban, Gemrany, the streets are filled with bicylcles and the chatter of wandering children beacuse there are no cars to be afraid of. Limiting car usage can better the well being of oursleves and everybody around us.

In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage in the world today. On every sidewalk, you would find relaxed and healthy people breathing clean and healthy air. We can create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources , lower emissions and improve safety."" We will never achieve a perfect world but it is not romantic or naive to work towards one.",0
"""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" There are 538 electors in the Electoral College. In order for a candidate to become President, a majority of 270 votes is required. I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of outcome and because of the states.

First, I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of the outcome. Because of the number of electors is even means that there could be tie. But, people don't understand that is very unlikely. As said in Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" So, most of the things that people stress over about the Electoral College are very unlikely to happen.

Secondly, I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the states. Two types of states are big states and swing states. Big states are the states that have the largest population that ""the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance"" on. One of the other types of states are the swing states. Swing states use the winnertakeall method. Swing states don't vote for the President based on his or her political party. They vote for the President based on who they are or who they like better out of the candidates so you never really can know who they are going to vote for.

In conclusion, I am in Favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of outcome and because of the states. The Electoral College have sources to rely on so that it won't fail. Most people just don't realize it because there has been a couple problems with the Electoral College before but, the Electoral College is a good system to have.",0
"Dear State Senator, I propose that we change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States rather than having the Electoral College. I say this because the Electoral College is unfair to voters in many ways more than one.

I'll start off by saying that Electoral College is unfair to voters. I strongly agree about this because under the electoral college system, voters do not vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors, who then elect the president. This system is unfair because you don't always know who your electors are and you can't always control who the electors vote for. If you can't or don't know who they are voting for, then how can we trust them with the fate of our country? Although us people don't always make the right decisions, at least with popular vote we would all know that our votes wouldn't be put in someone elses hands.

To continue my agreement, the Electoral College is also unfair in this way. Say if there was to be a tie in electoral votes, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. Then the state delegations would vote for the president and the Senate would chose the vice president. When this would happen you would then not know who they were going to vote for and what your government's fate would be. So again if we had election by popular vote this wouldn't happen.

Lastly, the Electoral College is unfair to voters by the winnertakeall system. Since there is a winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. An example of this is back during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't get to see the candidates at all. Some of the largest media markets didn't even see a single campaign ad. This is completely unfair and ridiculous to all potential voters.

In the end, I think that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and ridiculous. With all the valid points and arguments I have made, they make a pretty good reason to abolish the electoral college.",0
"While owning a car may seem like the most important possession a person can have, it is becoming more beneficial to find a way to live without them. Cities around the world are turning in their cars, even if just for a day, and finding that it brings plenty of advantages to make up for what could be seen by some as a troublesome lack of easy transportation. Both the environment and and the well being of the people are grateful for the new change, and examples of such will follow.

To begin, according to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, one can learn about Vauban, Germany, a place manifested so that residents of the upscale community must give up their cars. While residents are still permitted to own cars, they must be kept in large garages at the edges of the community. Here, the owner of the car must buy a space within the garage, along with a home in the residence. Parking on the streets is forbidden, along with driveways and home garages. The streets of the residency are completely free of cars, except for a few streets on one side of the community, and for where the tram to downtown runs through. Most of the citizens of Vauban choose not to own a car, or sold their car in order to move to the community, and find they are much more content in their lifestyle because of it. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, stated that she is ""much happier this way"", explaining that she was always tense while in possession of a car. This community was created as a prime example to showcase the advantages of limited or forbidden car usage, and it is now being used as the basis of the growing trend around the world, including America and more places in Europe, in which suburban life is being separated from its former dependence on auto use.

Furthermore, the reduction of air pollution and smog has become a major advantage in the limitation of car usage. After suffering through days of nearrecord pollution, Paris, France had composed a temporary driving ban in an attempt to clear the air, according to Rober Duffner in ""Paris Bans Driving due to Smog"". The passage goes further to explain that the ban followed five days of smog that rivalled the likes of Beijing, China, which is widely recognized for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Exceptions to the ban were made for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passengers, and public transportation was made to be free. Once the smog cleared enough, the ban was lifted and citizens were allowed back to the road, but the reduction of auto usage was what saved the air from becoming overly polluted. Moreover, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in a carfree day, entitled Day Without Cars, once a year to reduce smog in the cities, according to ""Carfree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. Violators are charged with 25 fines, but, according to Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus, the people participate, and the turnouts are large. This day without cars, which has begun to spread to other Colombian cities, is a fantastic way to reduce both air pollution and stress, and is a part of a campaign to oversee the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which, according to Mayor Mockus, is the most of any city in Latin America.

In addition, ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal tells the reader of the new goals created to cut down on America's greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, the goals, set by President Obama, have been graciously aided by recent studies which show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and have been making less of an effort to get a license as the years go by. With transportation being the second largest source of the nation's carbon emissions, behind power plants, this pattern, if maintained, will most likely have majorly benificial impacts on the environment.

All in all, there are many advantages that could easily come with limiting car usage, including the reduction of smog and a more pleasent lifestyle for the citizens who decide to limit or cease their auto usage. While transportation issues may arise when people begin to give up their motorized vehicle, or if they decide to not purchase one in the first place, as many already have, a quick purchase of a bike or the use of public transit can solve at least some of them.",0
"The electoral college should be abolished because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector source 1, and the voters cant always control who their electors vote for source 2. On the other hand the electoral college is a great thing because a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote source 3.

When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector source 1. Most people, including me, would like to vote for the president not a candidate because they might not even vote for the person you want for president. Some states are smaller then others so that makes them feel like their votes arent as important as the bigger states like California and Texas. The electoral college consists of only 538 electors compared to how many people are actually in the U.S. so there is a greater chance that the wrong president might be elected.

Many people do not vote because the voters cant always control who their electors vote for source 2. Not everyone wants to take the chance of voting for the wrong person to be elected for president. Some voters might get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate, as it says in source 2. Most states are small so most people in those states dont think the little states matter and they arent important in the election when they actually do.

On the other hand the electoral college is a great thing because a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote source 3. A better thing about the electoral college is that it requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, meaning that not all the vote can come from one or two regions and no other ones. Voters in presidential elections are the people who want to express a political preference rather than the people woh tihnk a single vote can dicide an election.

As a student I want the best for the up coming generations, including me, that are going to be able to be a part of the presidential elections and to not be confused who to vote for or how the electoral college works. Every year a new generation becomes legal to vote and be part of the election but if they dont know how to vote or how it works then they wont be able to. Some people dont know anything about poitics but, still want to be able to vote so, it should be easy for them to vote for who they want to be president rather then the long process of, voting for the canidates elector and most of the time they dont vote for who they want and they vote for the wrong person.",0
"When limiting car usage the first thing that most everyone thinks of is: ""How would I get from Point A to Point B instead of driving myself in my car? Would I walk, ride a bike, take public transportation, or try and find a new creative approach?"" Limiting car usage is not the end of the world, it is the beginning of a healthy one. Most cars burn gas which cause smog and pollution which is harmful to the environment, some people get lazy and end up being so dependent on a vehicle that they will not even consider walking a few blocks to a friend's house for an afternoon lunch, and our own ancestors have gone without a car for centuries on end. So would it really be that much of a struggle to not use a car any and every where that you go? You do not need to never use your car again, you just need to realize that using your vehicle more than needed is harming not just yourself, but everything and everyone you interact with in life.

In Paris, France a partial driving ban was put into effect just before the city of Love and Romance' reached record breaking pollution levels. The ban states that: ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following days.""""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer. However, just because there is a law put into affect does not mean that everyone will abide by it. According to Reuters, an international news agency in London, almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their vehicles impounded because of their reaction to the fines. It is a shame that people are so unwilling to follow one rule for one day which would help the planet and reduce the pollution in their city. According to Duffer, Paris ,typically, has more smog than other European capitals. When buffer's article was published he states, ""Last week Paris has 147 micrograms of particulate matterPM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" Also, in Paris, diesel fuel is used more than gasoline. Diesel engines take more energy to burn the gas which causes more pollution than just normal gasoline. According to Reuters, France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In France, as a whole, 67 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. In the rest of Western Europe, about 53 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. The smog that is in the air from the burning gas of your vehicle ends up in your lungs. Imgine just sitting in front of the exhaust pipe of your car for a few secondsdo not actually attempt this analogy it is overwhelming and unbearable. It is harmful to your lungs and the rest of your body. That pollution is coming out of thousands and thousands of other cars and is adding up to the air all around you. You breath that air every day, just like your family and friends as well. In Paris, after the partial driving ban, on Monday the smog cleared up enough for the French party to take away the ban on the oddnumbered plates on Tuesday, according to Duffer. If the smog in one of the biggest cities in the world can clear up just a little bit in one day from limiting car usage, imagine how much smog could be prevented if you limit your car usage every day. What if you only used your vehicle when traveling out of town or when you need to transport a large item? You can change your whole environment just by deciding to walk or ride the bus to work instead of turning on your vehicle to drive 10 miles down the road.

The law that was put affect in Paris, France does not state that you can never drive your vehicle again, it is just simply asking the citizens to go one day without their vehicle. ""But what if I have to go somewhere such as work, school, or anywhere else that I want?"" Paris is a large city, that much is understood, because it is a large city there is more than just one way of getting from Point A to Point B. One way is public transportation from the city andor local businesses, like a bus or tram. According to the BBC public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday as well. So, if you did not want to spend extra money than you had to that would not be a probolem. If you do not like public transportation, or do not prefer it, you can get out for a bit of exercise and ride a bike or even walk. Getting up or leaving maybe an hour or two early so that you can get to your desired destination on time is not that heavy of a price to pay. Also, you are getting exercise out of it which benefits your health. Walking or even riding a bike to work can benefit you in so many ways. If you see someone familiar walking towards you, you have the opportunity to start up a conversation and catch up with how their life is going. As well as this, if you see a small shop or stand that sparks your interest you have easier access to explore inside. If you were drivingriding in a vehicle then you would have to cross traffic, find a parking spot, make sure you grabbed everything that you need, and make sure that it is locked. If you are taking a stroll through town, you already have your needed things, you do not need to cross traffic and find a parking spot, and you do not have to risk accidentally leaving your vehicle unlocked and end up possibly getting robbed. A study discovered by Elisabeth Rosenthal found out that driving by youth decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe this is because young people still have the energy and sense of adventure in them to walk or take a bus somewhereor they just can not afford it, which in the long run saves them money anyway. Maybe you can learn from the young people that decide to ride a bike or skateboard to work instead of driving a car. Maybe taking public transportation is not as crowded and as much of a hassle as the movies make it seem. Taking public transportation can introduce you to new people with different backgrounds as well. You can meet someone that you might not see as a coworker or a family friend that you have an idea already who they are. Some people are always so busy with every day life that they do not have the time to meet new people and learn new names. With public transportation or deciding to walk instead you have a bigger opportunity to meet someone new. Why not give yourself a healthier lifestyle by walking once a week to work instead of driving? The question still remains, why not?

Limiting your vehicle usage does not limit your options and exposure to the outside world. Having a vehicle is not entirely a bad thing either. Some vehicles are 'eco friendly' and are built so they can help protect the environment. Sadly, however, most are not built and designed that way. Driving is so stressful for a person. You have to focus on all of your surroundings, check every blind spot, make sure that all of your fluids are not empty, replacing tires, and so much more. Again, driving is not all bad. Some people enjoy to drive, some say that is relaxes them and gives them time to think because driving is the only 'alone time' that they have. Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.",0
"Dear State Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept and not changed. With the Electoral College, the presidential candidates can not have transregional appeal. The Electoral College also reduces the risk of a runoff election, where no candidate wins a majority of the votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral college vote is also less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This system also encourages voters in tossup states to be more thoughtful with their vote. The Electoral college also helps in balancing out the weight that large states with a large population lose.

With the Electoral College, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This not only makes the votes more fair, but it also encourages the presidential candidate to be desirable to all regions, not just one that that the candidate knows will vote for him. A candidate with only regional appeal would likely cause residents of the other regions to feel that their votes do not count.

The Electoral College reduces the risk that no candidate wins a majority of the votes and instead, usually produces a clear winner. An example of this, as stated by Richard Posner in his argument in defending the Electoral college, is when Nixon and Clinton were elected. Both had only 43 percent plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. The Electoral College also avoids creating pressure when no candidate wins a majority of the votes.

As said by Posner, voters in tossup states who know they are going to decide the election are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and will be more thoughtful with their vote. They also will have received the most information and attention from the candidates. It also makes sense that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The weight in the political balance that large states with a large population lose is balanced by the Electoral College. An example ,given by Posner, is that the popular vote in Florida was very close in 2012, but Obama, who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes. The same margin in a smaller state would result in the winner getting alot less votes. This causes large states to get more attention from candidates than a small state does.

In coclusion, I would like to say that keeping the Electoral College is a great choice. It will make presidential elections more fair and balanced than purely relying on a popular vote. The Electoral College produces more thoughtful votes, which intern will result in the best candidate for the people to have as president.",0
"Dear my Senator, whats the point in voting if our vote may not even count?

In the Electoral college people citizens vote for a slate of electors who then later go and vote for president. However, sometimes it doesn work that way. The electors are not obligated to choose the president that the people want. The Electoral college is corrupt and needs to go away.

The people of America dont like the Electoral college and want something new. Stated in source 2, "" gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent off voters would prefer a dirt election to the kind we have now."" In short, people were so unhappy with the election and the way it ended. people would rather have direct voting than to continue with an Electoral college.

The Electors in the Electoral college arnt always innocent. They can lie, cheat, they go behind the backs of the states citizens and not even vote for who the citizens want. In 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature tried to get rid of the democratic electors. They wanted to replace them with people who would oppose John F Kennedy. source 2, number 11 says ""In some vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."" This means that with an Electoral college, the person you want to vote for may not even get picked cause of lying electors.

Even though the electoral college is a pretty bad thing, there are still a few upsides. The Electoral college avoids te problem of neither candidates getting a majority of the votes. In source 3, number 22 There is no pressure for runoffelections when no candidatewins a a majority the votes cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invariable produces a clear winner... Simply this says that without the electoral college voting can be difficult and stressful.

In conclusion, The Electoral college may not be the best thing for our society, and also can we even trust that our votes even matter? either the Electoral college cant be trusted and it needs to be gone for good, or something needs to change.",0
"Cars are a very, very common mode of transportation used all over the world. People depend on cars to get them from place to place every single day. While driving cars seem to be the quickest and easiest form of transportation, there are negative sides to it. These negative effects can be harmful to the environment and humans if we aren't careful. Therefore, citizens should take a step forwards limiting their car usage. The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle.

When cars are used, they can pollute the air with harmful chemicals and toxins. Air pollution is a serious issue that is occurring around the globe. This is important because cars are polluting the air we need in order to survive. Some cities around the world have gotten so polluted that they had to restrict people from using cars over a period of time to try and cleanse the air. If you drove during the ban, then you would receive a fine. Paris and bogota are two cities that participated in the ban. After the pollution cleared up some, the ban was lifted in both cities. Therefore, reducing the air pollution is a major advantage to not using your car as much.

Over time, cars can use up a lot of resources. Cars run on gasoline, which is a fossil fuel. There is only so much of it and once it's gone, it's gone. Our fossil fuels are being used up quick, so it's time to start saving them. You can save resources by driving around less. Instead of driving yourself, you could either walk, ride a bicycle, skate, ride a bus, or carpool with some friends. These are all ways you could help save the planet's resources.

Lastly, limiting how much you drive your car can be beneficial because it is a healthier lifestyle for you. You could get more excerise and help the environment at the same time. One community in Germany, named Vauban, gave up their cars completely. They are in a movement called ""smart planning."" This community gets around by walking or riding bicycles. Their lifestyle includes having stores and markets a walk away so they have easier access to them. Having a healthier lifestyle is an advantage because it's important to take care of yourself.

The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle. Driving less reduces smog because it helps clean the air from toxins. It also helps save the limited amount of fossil fuels that we have. Not to mention, driving your car less will give you a chance to live a healthier lifestyle because you will get much more excercise. Overall, driving less is beneficial to both humans and the environment. Therefore, join the movement and limit your car usage.",0
"You get pearly on November 6, 2012 ready to vote, because every vote counts! But does it really? Instead of your vote going directly towards who you want as president, it goes towards the electoral collge and then they decide who really wins the presidency. The Electoral College ia a system where instead of the people vote for the president, a group of electors choose the next leader of the free world. I fervently believe that we should abolish the electoral College sytem, and change the election of popular ovte because it is an injustice, outdated, and irrational.

The Electoral College system is highly unfair. The voters wnat to elect the president that they would like, and in order to do that their vote should be significant. Although the Electoral Collge system is at times efficient, it still does not satisfy the voters. The people aren't even the ones who get an actual say on who their next president will be. Even the people who are in defense of the Electoral College System agree, ""It is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" 15, says Richard A. Posner author of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing president."" In the 2000 elections, candidate Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, and won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral college vote so he lost the presidency. If this is supposedly a ""free"" country with a democratic system, then shouldn't the citizens have the right to pick the individual that will be running their country for the next four years?

Some electors may not even vote with the majority. Voters can't control who their electors vote for. The electors are even sometimes picked by the presidential candidate running for office, how does it seem fair that a group of people that hold the fate of our country in their hands is chosen by soemone who would be highly affected by their decision.

It is also an injustice because of the way the votes count. If you live in a state with a higher population, your state gets more electoral votes. The amount of electors depends on the amount of senators and representatives your state has. There is one elector per representative, and two per senator. There is a total of 538 electors, and to win presidency the candidate most have at least 270 or higher. For example sya you live in Iowa, where there are only four electors, the vote doesn't count as much as the votes in California or Florida. The system is completely outdated too. The Electoral College system has been around for hundreds of yars,a dn it is not up to date with our modern times, so it is a complete waste to use it.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, My names is PROPER_NAME. I am 14 years old, born and raised in the beautiful city of LOCATION_NAME and I am writing to talk to you about the Electoral College. I've done my research, and according to the article What Is the Electoral College?

by the Office of the Federal Register, it was first established ""in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" What I understood from that text is that it was made to keep equality and fairness between the government and the people. If that is so, why is it that the people have no say in it? I believe that the election should be based on the popular vote because the people should get what the people want.

The Constitution says ""We the people, by the people, for the people,"" yet the people have limited power. I understand that in order to form a more perfect union of our nations, their must be laws and rules and people who govern, as well as enforce, these laws and rules. All I'm asking for is a bit more freedom and power as a citizen of these United States of America.

I'm not the only one who thinks this way. ""...according to a gallop poll in 2000...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Their has been several cases in which the candidate has ""won the popular vote but lost the presidency"" Plumer. For instance, the election in 2000 with Al Gore, where his opponent, George W. Bush, received 271 electoral votes and he received 266, eventhough Gore won the popular vote. Instead of voting for a group of people who vote for us, what's the harm in letting the people choose our nation's leader?

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by bradford Plumer, has a section titled What's wrong with the electoral college in which he questions ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"", to which he replies, ""Not always."" If ""we the people"" are supposed to be the one's with the freedom, then we should have the freedom to at least choose who we're going to have as our President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" Plumer. Take Mitt Romney, for example. He ran for president in 2012, and, knowing that campaigning down South, where he would already be receiving the votes, would not gain him any electoral votes, he didn't campain there at all. This is why they focus on the ""swing"" or ""tossup"" states, and make the other states feel left out, like ""the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president."" Posner To prevent the states to feel left out and to prevent an injustice such as this one, we should end the anachronism that is the Electoral College. ""...The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best."" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO have all agreed on it at one point in time: ""Abolish the Electoral College!"" Plumer.",0
"Dear saaae senaaor, My leaaer is in regards ao changing ahe elecaion ao popular voae for ahe presidena of ahe Uniaed Saaaes. I believe ahaa we, ahe people, should have ahe opporauniay ao choose whom we wish ao become Presidena.

The reason why people go oua ao voae, is because ahey have a specific person in mind. Alahough ahroughoua elecaion aime, many people are brougha ao differena conclusions ahaa one candidaae is beaaer ahen ahe oaher, or ahey boah have aheir flaws yea, ahey sarongly represena one ahing ahe oaher candidaae dispises. Eiaher way, ahere are ahose aypes of people who jusa cannoa decide. They may be lefa undecided, and have changed aheir minds by ahe aime ia's ready ao voae. Ia's a big deal for people ao go oua and aake acaion. So whaa would make ahe elecaoral college change one view of voaing? Ias ahe faca ahaa we aren'a really voaing for our presidena. We are voaing for our elecaors of ahe saaae, ao voae for our presidena. And on aop of ahaa, ahere are saill many people oua ahere who don'a have a clue ahaa aheir acaually voaing for someone in our saaae ao decide for us. Alahough ahe elecaoral college does help make ahe presidenaial elecaion less complicaaed, ia's ahe mere faca ahaa WE aren'a making much of a difference.

The elecaoral college doesn'a only have a few minor sea backs, bua ia could aarnish oua dreams of who we wanaed ao be presidena by way more ahan we could've expecaed. When ia comes ao voaing for elecaors, ias a difficula ahing when ia comes ao how many elecaors represena which poliaical paray. Democraa, or Republican. Say one wanaed ahe one candidaae running for presidena ao win, and heshe were Republican. Thaa person would go oua and casa a voae for a slaae of however many of republican elecaors ahere are for ahaa saaae. The para ahaa geas a loa of people is ahaa ahere could be fewer Republican elecaors ahen ahere are Democraa elecaors. Say one saill wanaed ahe Republican candidaae ao win and ahey voaed in aheir residenaial saaae which was Nevada. IF Nevada had 4 Republican elecaors ahen ahaa meana anyone who voaed for ahe Democraa elecaoral wasn'a chipping in much ao ahe elecaion. In ahe end, all ahe elecaors voaes are counaed for each side, and because Nevada had only awo dedicaaed Democraas, ahe chances of ahe Democraa candidaae having less elecaoral voaes ahen ahe Republican candidaae, has increased. If ahis problem happenes for several oaher saaaes, ahen ahe chances double, even ariple.

If ahis doesn'a make you ahink ahaa ahe elecaoral college should go, ahen ahink again. The elecaoral college is definiaely unfair ao voaers. Any chance of unfaiahful elecaors, could happen. Ia could make one feel bearayed ahaa ahey voaed foe a specific elecaor ao do one job. Which was ao help seleca ahe presidena ahe voaer wanaed. Whaas ahe poina in puaaing your arusa in someone who could jusa easily aurn around and NOT voae who you wanaed? There is no poina. Bua ahaa's whaa we're doing when we voae.

We should be lucky ahaa back in '00, ahaa was ahe biggesa elecaion crisis and ia COULD'VE been worse.

In conclusion, we ahe people, should have ahe opporauniay ao voae and acaually have our voae counaed.

"Voting for president should be fair and democratic to all the people. Decisions for the country that affect the people should ultimately be determined by them since their lives could be greatly impacted by those decisions. Today, the country determines the election of the president of the United States by using the electoral college. Although the electoral college is effective in many ways, does it really portray what the people want? Changing the election to election by popular vote would determine what the people want in a more democratic and fair way. The United States was built upon democracy and that strong profile should be kept.

The electoral college is a process by which voters vote for electors that elect the president determined by their political party. In theory it may seem like an effective process, but it can bring many problems. Source 2 says that the single best argument we have against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The election crisis of 2000 was because of the electoral college process and that even worse things could have happened. The electoral college has brought a lot of problems. ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" Source 2. Electors refusing to vote for their party's candidate, or refusing to vote altogether could lead to things like Hawaii sending two slates of electors to Congress in 1960. The electoral college system leads to a lot of complications and using popular vote would make the process simpler.

Voting by the electoral college can bring unfairness to the voting process. Source 3 explains that when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Your votes do not directly go to the president you want, so even if a president wins the popular vote, they could still lose the electoral college vote and the election all together. ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538is an even number, but it is highly unlikely....,"" Source 3. Voting by popular vote would not allow this to happen because of the amount of people voting and the likelihood of that happening is even less. Also, the fairness of small states and big states is not democratic in the electoral college process. Since larger states have a greater population, they tend to get more attention than smaller states do. There would clearly be more equality in voting by popular vote than in the electoral college.

""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a poplular vote of qualified citizens,"" Source 1. Although this compromise was good in theory at the time, the process is not very fair and does not bring the right people to be elected as electors. The electors are chosen depending on how they reach certain criteria by the law. These laws vary though, which could bring a wide variety of people from each state. This would give some states the upper hand compared to others. There would be no worry about the certain people chosen as electors in the process of popular vote.

The electoral college brings complications, unfairness, and the worry of chosing electors from each state. The Untited States was built upon the idea of general democracy and the process of the electoral college does not carry out that idea. Chosing the president by popular vote would give the people a more democratic way of chosing whom they want to be in charge of the country. The people of the country are the ones most impacted by decisions of the country, so they should have more of a say in what is decided.",0
"Bycicles. Walking. Public buses. All three are alternatives to driving a car to arrive at places that you need to go. Some believe that having an automobile is essential to everyday life. Others may say that cars are unnecessary and a pollutants in our society. There are many advantages of limited car usage.

Limiting the use of cars could help reduce the amount of pollutantss in our environment. In Source two, it states, ""Cold nights and warm air caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission."" This tells us that car emissions are being caught in the air due to the weather, causing a layer of smog to settle over congested cities. By limiting the use of automobiles, the layer of smog was able to vanish, but if we were able to limit cars permanently, then we would not have to worry about it in the first place. In Source four, it tells us that, ""If the pattern persists... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" This proves that car emissions are harmful to the environment and that future generations are at risk because of the pollution already in the air. Also, the statement shows that Americans are very dependant on transportation, but are unwilling to try a different method such as walking and biking. By reducing the number of cars on the road, our environment would be helped tremendously.

Having to worry about driving a car may produce more stress in a persons life. In Source three, it says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This tells us that riding in an automobile, while the roads are very crowded, causes people to worry about whether or not they are going to be in an accident. Also, it has been proven that exercise helps to lower stress, and by riding a bike instead of driving a car, stress may be lowered by simply using your resources to get where you need to go. In Source one, it tells us, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now. Heidrun Walter, mother of two."" This proves that people are worried about their car and if it might break down, or something worse. Something can always go wrong with a car, whether it be trouble with the engine or you accidently locked your keys inside, and it becomes very expensive when you have to fix a small blunder. By limiting car ownership, less people have to worry about their automobile.

A great alternative to owning a car is public transportation. In Source four it explains, ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" By uses others means of transportation, it makes it very convenient for kids to meet up with their friends for a while, and still get to where they need to go. Also, public transportation is much cheaper than buying a car and gas for it, and it helps reduce the number of cars on the road. In Source two, it tells us that ""Public transit was free of charge for Friday to Monday."" By taking the bus that the government provided people received free transportation, allowing them to not have to worry about parking, gas prices, or potential accidents. They could travel wherever they needed to go on a very convinient mode of transportation for no cost to them. Public transportation, or carpooling, is an amazing way to lower the number of cars on the road, while still providing people with a way to be driven to the destination they need to get to.

Automobiles, the plugs to the sinks of the streets of the world, seem to clog up the efficient system of transportion. Parents, workers, and athletic kids alike are affected by the large number of cars on the road. By reducing the number of cars on the road, there would be a direct impact on our environment, emotions, and future generations.",0
"Changing our ways on how we use cars for the better? Is it just so happen that people are using there car less than usual? In many places like Germany, Paris, Bogota are changing the ways to use cars. To reduce every little problem cars are causing. Traffic jams, smogs, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, people are getting smart about using there cars everyday. Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.

When people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certain places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? You would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are actually happy that they put this new type of law. Many people preferred to have this happen.

Smogs? what are smogs? smogs are grey clouds that hurt is in ways we dont even know. Cars emmit these deadly gases and we dont know it. Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help reduce this problem. On mondays motorists with evennumbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.

Places like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Many sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end. Cars sales have drop alot. People are taking the bus, taxis, and even trains to avoid traffic. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Younges ages don't even drive till the age of 21 or they don't even care till then. They can usually care poll to places like partys, mall and the beach. They don't need a seperate car for each person when they are all going to the same place. Which is feel its a good and bad things. Its good because poeple are caring more that were causing harm to our own home and that they know that they can do all they want together and still have fun. It causes harm to busineses many stores could go out of business.

It does not matter if we try to stop using cars or not we are always hurting in some other way. Traffic jams, smogs and reducing greenhouse emissions are just the begining of this all. We can do way more if we put out mind set to it.",0
"Dear me. Senator, I am fed up with the electoral college. The system allows for so much disaster to occur. It isn't strict at all and it allows a variety of things to happen that wouldn't end well. The people deserve to make the decisions. Because the electoral college systems has so many holes and problems with it.

One of the best arguments against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. One big example of the disaster factor is the 2000 year election. In this election Al Gore had more votes than George Bush, but still lost by 5 votes because of the electoral college. In 1960, segregationists in Louisiana almost succeeded in replacing the democratic electors who oppose John F. Kennedy. If they succeeded and the popular vote went to Kennedy, it would not have actually gone to Kennedy. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" Plumer Second off, one of the most worrying things is if there is a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens the election vote would be given to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote for the president. The vice president vote is given to the senate. Each state only casts one vote which insures that 55 million voters and 500,000 have the same power. Given the size of those numbers, and that people in those states may vote one party for president and one party for congress, the House's decision could hardly reflect on the peoples choice. We have come pretty close to this happening too, in 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted differently. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" Plumer There is a few reasons that opposing opioninated people use to justify wanting to keep the Electoral College around. One of them is that the president has to appeal to multiple regions. A candidate can not just be a favor of the south and get elected, he has to campaign and be desirable to all the regions. This is good because a president that was popular in just one region would not be successful, because everyone else in the other regions would feel like they do not regard their interests. Unfortuanitly this is solved by popular vote, since it is by individual not by state. Other votes in other states balance them out. ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Poser The Electoral College has many reasons for it and against it. But I strongly feel that we should get rid of it for the reasons shown above. From the ""Disaster factor"" to the threat of a electoral tie. Of course other people feel differerent and have different opinions but I feel like popular vote is for the best. Thank your for taking the time to listen to my opinions.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The whole world has already figured that out. Many countries are now starting to limit the car usage. It is a good idea to limit the car usage because they damage our environment and cars are not needed for average everyday life.

First, reducing the use of cars would make the world a much better place in terms of the environment. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" written by Robert Duffer he explains how the smog caused by cars has polluted the air causing Paris to put a partial ban on driving. "" Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...."". This quote by Robert Duffer explains just how bad the air must have been polluted because of the cars. They blamed the pollution on diesel fuel and that was 67 percent of the cars in France, which is a lot, and it was so bad that they had to make a partial ban to driving. We can already tell that our environment is not that good because of all the other pollutants that we have but by reducing the usage of cars that can make our environment so much better because that is getting rid of one major factor to the problem of pollution.

Next, many people do not even use cars that much. As stated in the article ""The end of car culture"" written by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.."". In this quote it states that a lot of new people are not starting to drive anymore. Without new people driving we will just loose the amount of people driving continuosly becasue of people dying and no people to replace them. Also in the article ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"" written also by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it explains how the people don't need cars anymore because they can just walk, ride, or find another way to their destination. Therefore if there is no longer a need for cars then we can easily limit the use of them.

In conclusion, there is not a reason anymore to use cars. If we can compact some cities and make everything easy enough to access without a car then we could just get rid of them completely. Cars are only used for transportation, otherwise they just cause problems like pollution, acciedents, and being unhealthy. So it would be excellent to limit car usage to help the environment and to jsut get rid of them entirely becasue we no longer need them.",0
"A Electoral College is a meeting of thee electors where theey vote for president and vice president.

According to source theree.""thee residents of thee otheer regions are likely to feel disenfranchisedto feel theat theeir votes do not count,theat thee new president will have no regard for theeir interests,theat he really isn't theeir president.""Line 19 This means theat thee people who vote will theink theat its a waste of theeir time since theeir vote will not count. They will be ignored knowing theat theeir vote will have no interest and theat thee president wont really be theier president.

Thirdly, we should keep it because of thee swing states. The swing states is a winnertakeall metheod. Voters will pay more attention to thee campaign because theey know theat theey will decide on thee election. They will be known as thee theoughtful voters because theey will have recieved thee most information and attention and should be thee ones the decide thee election. The otheer people wont know alot about thee candiadates and will just pick theeir favorite.

Some people might argue about thee disator factor. Its where theere is a tie between thee states. They might say what will happen theen? However, theats why theere is representatives. They break thee tie on who to become president.

In conclusion,we should keep thee Electoral college because of thee certainty of outcome, everyones president and by thee swing states.",0
"Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionately. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them.

Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all of the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all of the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted.

Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an antithesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.

Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100assume 20 people equals an electoral vote. If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...""Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winnertakesall method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.",0
"Imagine a world without garages, stations, or parkinglots. The problem with today's world is our lives revolve around cars to get us where we want to be and they have become a status symbol for many. The thought of being without a car scares most people, but limiting car usage is becoming more popular in cities, and has shown many advantages in the environment and in the communities. For example, the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars completely Rosenthal. On the otherhand, Paris, France banded driving due to smogonly odd license plates could drive one day and even numbered plates could drive the next day Duffer. Many advantages came with limiting driving in these cities such as, less air pollution from tailpipe, congestion lessened, and introduced alternative ways of transportation into different communities.

""Passenger cars are 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the Unites States"" Rosenthal. This means if car usage was limited than we could cut back on almost 50 percent of our pollution in the United States. ""Transportation is the second largest source for America's emissions"" Rosenthal. The limiting of car usage would also help and knock down cars as being the second biggest emissions source in the U.S. Without so much air pollution in the United States we could live healthier and better lives. We would be able to reduce global warming if we reduce the amount of driving we do.

Another advantage with limiting car usage would be the decrease in congestion around our city and towns. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" Duffer. This means that traffic would die down as well, there would be no more rush hour after work, and the roads would be safer because there would be less people driving on them.

Lastly, limiting car usage would bring people to find alternative and healthier ways to get to where they need to be. In Bogota, Colombia every year for one day millions of people bike, skateboard, or take public transport to get where they want to be Selsky. With people using alternative ways to get to work it would not only benefit the environment as well as benefiting their health.

The answer is clear, we need to limit the usage of cars in America. Other countries are doing it and now is our time to jump on board with the movement of less car movement. So the next time you get in the car and buckle your seatbelt think about the advantages that could come from not driving today.",0
"People in America vote for a candidate running for president believing that their vote counts, but in reality it all comes down to the Electoral College. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election tot he kind we have now."" We, as a country, need to change to election by popular vote for the president of the united states in order to have fair completion instead of the people of America voting for a potential president only to find out the vote was worth nothing.

To begin with, majority of the nation wants to abolish the Electoral Congress because it's an unfair process. Bradford plumer states, ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" It should be that the voters vote for the president, but we are just voting for electors so they can vote for the president putting our nation's future in danger. The Electoral College used to be the the right way of election but now it's known as something from the past. Traditionally, the Electoral College was ""a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens, paragraph 1, by the Office of the Federal Register"" in which the founding fathers established this process of election knowing that then it was the correct way. But now, this process is ""outdated paragraph 14, Bradford Plumer"" and there needs to be election by popular vote.

Another key point, former presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, agree with ""abolishing the electoral college paragraph 9, Bradford Plumer"" as do Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFLCIO, and the Gallup poll in 2000. Majority wants to get rid of the Electoral College in order to lets the popular vote decide who become president. also, voters cant always control who their electors vote for. Bradford Plumer notes, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" The Al Gore election is an example of the unfairness that the Electoral College is pursuing. Al Gore won the popular vote against George W. Bush nationwide, which means the people wanted Gore, but he did not recieve enough electoral votes to win the election.

In the Electoral College's defense, the Electoral College, as illustrated by Richard A. Posner, ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution,"" meaning that a presidential candidate will give more attention to a larger state than a smaller state. Without the Electoral College, the president wouldn't have ""transregional appeal paragraph 19, Richard A. Posner,"" meaning that no one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president so the Electoral College requires the ""transregional appeal."" To conclude, our nation needs to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of election by the Electoral College because this process of election is unfair to the voters of this nation. Also, majority wins and the majority of the country wants to repeal the Electoral College then we should make a change. If we want this nation to be the strongest it can be then we need to make choices that will positively affect our country and the people of our country.",0
"or. Senator, I think that the Electoral College is a decent way to vote for president. But is it really the best way? Though the Electoral College elects presidents in a way favored by many, it doesn't allow for people to directly vote for the president. Because of that, the Electoral College should be abolished and changed to election by popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College can make things unfair. As stated in the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College"", ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"" Source 2. That statement basically says that when a voter goes to vote, they aren't voting for the president, but for someone to go and vote for them. Also, who exactly are the people we go and let vote for the person leading our country? According to the article, ""Electors can be anyone not holding public office"" Source 2. The people who go and vote can't control who these electors vote for. That's just another way that the Electoral College can be unfair to the voters.

Along with being unfair to the voters, the Electoral College can also be unfair to other people as well, for example, the candidates actually running for president. In an article that is for the Electoral College, it states that, ""...the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" Source 3. Does this mean that the Electoral College may have been a good system a while ago, and maybe not as good this day in age? Yes, it does. Also, in the article, it states, ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"" Source 3. That being said, there is always a chance that the result of an election will not be what the country as a whole wants, but what the electors want.

To conclude, the Electoral College is a very interesting process that everyone should know about. But I believe that the Electoral College should be a process that stays in textbooks to be learned about, not to actually be used. The Electoral College should be gone and be changed to election of popular vote. After all, the Preamble to the Constitution says, ""We the people"", not ""We the electors"".",0
"Dear Senator, There has been some recent heat on the topic of the Electoral College. I believe that it is only fair to keep the Electoral College. Although some voters may be upset with the fact that they don't define who wins the presidential election, it is best that way. If there was no Electoral College people with no actual idea of whats going on would vote, and that could have a negative affect. Also if there was no Electoral College there would be an unfair amount of votes in larger states. The last reason is Swing States, which is also a very important part of the voting process.

First and Foremost, the Electoral College may make voters feel like they have no input on the election, but really they decide who the Electoral voters choose. Without Electoral voters, there would be indecisive people voting for a candidate they know nothing about. For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it.

Secondly, I believe that having the Electoral College is great because, without it larger states would have more of a say on who becomes president. This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still ""independent voters"". For example, as stated in paragraph twentyone, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twentynine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smaller ones.

Lastly, The Electoral College is a very important part of our voting process becaue of Swing States. As stated in paragraph twenty, voters in tossup states are ""more likely to listen to the campaign and the competing candidates"". These voters know that their votes wont make much of an impression on the election, but pay the most attention anyways. People claim that the most involved voters should be able to decide the elections. Although they don't have much of a say it is nice to know that people do care about the elections and do pay close attention to what is going on.

To conclude my previously stated reasons, I believe that having the Electoral College is a crucial part of the system. Because without it the nation would have so many voters that only cast their votes based off of popular opinion. Also without it larger states would have more of an affect on the votes than the smaller states do. Finally, Swing States are a very important part of voting because voters who know what is going on and actually pay attention do have one of the biggest affects.",0
"When hearing about the Electoral College, most people think of a group of individuals casting votes based on the popularity of the candidate in their state. What they don't know is that ""the Electoral College is a process, not a place""source 1 Some people, like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole, have all thought that the Electoral College should be abolished and be replaced by the popular vote. According to a poll taken in 2000, 60 percent of voters believe the presidency should be decided on the popular vote source 2. After thoroughly researching, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote. The current system of electing isn't exactly democratic and there is a chance for there to be a tie in the votes.

Most states have a ""winnertakesall"" system with the exception ofmine and Nebraska that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate in their state.source 1 There may be an argument that no state has enough votes to give the presidency to someone however, this system basically casts away the other votes of those on the side of the opposing candidate, making it undemocratic. Besides that, there is also the chance that a few of the electors go rouge and vote for the opposing candidate. To be a democracy means to listen to the voice of the people however, the college may not always listen.

The electoral College consists of 538 electors, meaning that the possibility of there being a tie is likely. When there is a tie, the fate of the potential presidents lie in the House of Representatives. When the election results are in the hands of the House, the selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. It will be more likely that they will vote for the candidate in their party rather than listen to the people's vote. Not only does it ignore the rights of the people, but this gives an unfair advantage to the candidate who's party is currently in power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a ""nondemocratic method of selecting a president..."" source 3. Instead the choice of presidency should be at the will of the people, not in the hands of electors. In the words of Plumer, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.",0
"I believe that the electoral college should be taken away because presidents that have won the popular vote have lost the election due to the electoral college and to me that just does not seem right ""Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency""source 2 Plumer 9. If it was not for the electoral college Gore would have won the election. If this country really is a government by the people and for the people then the government would get rid of the electoral college.

The electoral college is very outdated it has been in use sense the founding fathers made it ""The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise"" source 1 OFR paragraph 1. it might have worked well back then but now it is outdated it has been three hundred years since it has been changed and it simply does not work that well anymore.

If there was no winner take all system it might just be a little more fair ""the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeallsystem"" source 2 Plumer paragraph 13. Candidates do not even give every state a chance they usually just skip the state that they know they will not win over ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning""source 2 Plumer paragraph 13.

That is why iI think the electoral college should be taken out it is outdated, and it is unfair. If this country was really run by the people than the people would really get to pick the president. Those are my only really big issues with the electoral college, but that does not mean that I do not want to see it go.",0
"The electoral college, a mistake? Many Americans are unsatisfied with the electoral college and the system it follows. The electoral college has disappointed millions of Americans of any social class. According to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , by Bradford Plummer, "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the electors, who in turn elect the president."" America should abolish the electoral college as it has upset 60 percent of americans and elected unwanted Presidents.

""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency"", as said by Bradford Plummer. Every year Americans fall stricken by disappointment from the electoral college. The system of the electoral college is a poor representation of american ideals as candidates do not even bother spending time in nonswing states. According to Bradford Plummer, in the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not even see the candidates at all and 25 percent of the largest media markets did not even see a single campaign ad. As previously proven, the electoral college must be abolished due to the unfairness of its system.

The electoral college believers say that the electoral college stops disaster from happening, this is false. As Americans vote they vote for a slate of electors, which definitely creates a loss of the opposing or minority votes. This is because of the winnertakesall system that the electoral college runs off of. When the majority of the votes is accounted for, the minority votes are basically thrown away in a sense. Also, the electoral college ruins the chance of a more correct voting experience for old and new voters, making Americans ashamed and unwilling to vote because of the feeling of their vote meaning nothing or perhaps being crippled by the electoral college.

When the founding fathers of America created the electoral college it was an age without technology, making the electoral college a grand idea. Long ago, the electoral college served a patriotic and noble purpose as their was no technology and much less people. In todays age of technology, the record keeping and election process could not get any better as long as the electoral college is abolished and never reincarnated. The electoral college abolishes individual votes for the majority, crippling the American voting experience and smuthering it in shame and disappointment. The electoral college is outdated in many ways and should be dismissed from America.

In conclusion, the electoral college is shaming Americans from every state. This system should be permanantly abolished becuase of its lack of fairness and reliability. Every American vote should count just as much as its opposing vote instead of being dismissed. Free the vote and let the electoral college be forever dismissed of its dutys.",0
"Greetings Mr. State Senator, Looking over the Electoral College, there has come to be a few interesting details. Yes, the process is beautifully thought out but as we look at it deeper it has its flaws. The founding fathers have given us the Electoral College, which anarchist are very unappreciative veiwing it as a nondemocratic way to vote.

If the Electoral College system goes, then Americans can have their full Constitutional rights. Using this process voters are not voting for the electors of their choice, voters are voting on higher qualified voters to vote for the electors. The whole process is a violator of the amendment entitled to voting. Having this maze of voting for voters, what if a voter confuses of who the electors is voting for so their vote isint actually going to the candidate of their choice. In 1960 before the election of John F. Kennedy, the segregationists of the Louisiana legislator came very close to replacing all of the Democratic electorss with electorss who opposed John F. Kennedy. So all the voters in favor of JFK. will be voting against him and all the Electoral College votes would be going to the other candidate.

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defences are wrong , ""At the most basic level, the electorsal college is unfair to voters."" Plumer makes a very valid point beacuse of the size of states. The electorsal College's number of representatives are as big as their states population. So if all of the representatives in Alaska vote on the Republican candidate, and most of the people in California vote for the Democratic candidate, the Electoral College vote in California overules the vote in Alaska.

The Electoral College can make some voters not want to vote, usually because of their state size their vote doesnt count as much. Many voters in larger states refuse to vote because their vote wont really change the Electoral Collage's vote. The voters don't have total control over an electors, so the whole election crisis could happen again.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may have worked when the colonies were small and the votes counted, but today the modern society doesnt appreciate its lack of Constitutional rights. All we ask is for our right to vote to be given to us, so we can take part in our government.",0
"When you turn sixteen, you're filled with anticipation and angst of getting your licence, and furthermore a car! I know, I have certainly been there. But, what's so good about getting a car? Well, other than the new found sense of freedom. Not much. Car usage has accelerated since the 1900's and is starting to gradually decline. Why? Less stress, less pollution, and more excerise. These things alone may not be enough to convince you, so let's jump into the facts.

First off, getting rid of that car in your driveway will greatly lower your stress. ""As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"""". When you think about it, it truly makes sense. When you have a car you have to worry about gas prices, payments, and fixes. But, when you live a car free life none of that is of your concern. So, therefore your stress decreases and your happiness can go up to an all time high. When you have one less bill each month it truly does leave an impact.

Secondly, we have a big issue that is in our hands... Pollution and smog. Who's fault is it? Ours. Fumes and smoke crowding into our atmosphere with no where else to go. Our cars are a huge part of it. ""Diesel fuel was blamed"" in France for their smog layers. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions."" We need to put a stop to this. It is destroying our planet. It will continue to destroy it until we make a change and do something to make this stop. It's in our hands and we can't just let it go. The problem will not just go away. It will not just fix itself.

When you are living in this day in age many people have cars, so they have no need to go out and walk, or skate, or bike anywhere because they have a more ""efficiant"" way of transportation. ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday,"" This means that people would be getting up and active to get to work and other places that they may need to be. Helping our environment and themselves.

Furthermore, cars are slowly but surely being forgotten, people are stopping their use of cars and taking alternative transportation. ""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling."" So, it's not as big of a deal as it used to be. Not everyone needs or wants to have a car anymore. ""If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for the carbon emmissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" When you decide that you don't want a car, you're benefiting from it and the future is benefiting from it. Taking the next step seems a bit out of reach but we can make it.

In conclusion, people see cars as something that is a must have. Or, a next step in their freedom. But, we can change that. Show the world that it is more harmful than helpful. ""One small step for man, a leap for mankind."" We can get there, but it takes more than one person to set down the keys. Reduce your stress, reduce the pollution, and increase your happiness. All it takes is one person to start a movement.",0
"America's love of cars may soon be spiraling down. With America's car culture seemingly coming to an end, there will be more alternative ways to get to work, school, shopping districts, and etc. As the years come and go by quickly, Americans are buying less cars and obtaining fewer licenses for themselves. The advantages we can receive by limiting our car usage is that it takes away stress, lowers air pollution, and benefits daily businesses.

First, Limiting car usage takes away stress. As businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states:""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" People who no longer own a car will not have to worry as much about their car. Such as the price of gas rising, car payments, and insurance payments. These type of payments every month often put a big dent in a person's wallet. If we take up to the opportunity of limiting our car usage, we really won't have to worry about car payments anymore. Plus, being outside in the environment will certainly reduce stress levels almost completely, because we are interacting with others that are walking and enjoying the the environment outside.

In addition to, taking away stress. Limiting car usage will result in lower air pollution. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" If we limit car usage, the levels of air pollution will dramatically decrease resulting in cleaner air and a healthy environment for us to live in. If we continue to use cars, we are further damaging the air that we breathe everyday and causing people to damage their lungs. Pollution often has chemicals that can harm our breathing and sometimes our lungs. As Americans it is our responsibility to take care of the earth and we are not doing so by constantly using our cars.

Lastly, limiting car usage benefits daily businesses. Selsky staes: ""Parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. If we rely on walking to stores, etc. that are only a block away, it will surely increase the revenue of restaurants and shopping districts. Since the stores are so close to home, we'll be more willing to enter the store andor restaurant. Increasing businesses revenue also helps the economy, which we desperately need.

In conclusion, these advantages that we have gone over in the essay will greatly impact the future of America. Such as, taking away stress from former car owners, lowering the air pollution so we have a cleaner air to breathe, and beneifiting our daily businesses to increase revenue and better our economy. If we all limit car usage and follow the advantages listed, it will result in a better earth for us to live in.",0
"Cars are starting to become more and more expensive everyday. Why pay when a person could either use train,bike,or just walking. Stated in source 1 ""As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here..."" Many people are glad that they had sold their car because it just cost to much money for others. Therefore many people need to limit their car usage.

To begin with, Cars could have many flaws that may infect the environment or humans. Stated in source 2 ""After dats of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" So because cars take in gas it may effect the environment because inside of the car is more chemicals a that comes out of the exhaust system. Stated in source 1 ""Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new sixyear federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said."" this may be true because gas prices may go down and the environment will stay clean. However, waiting for public may mean waiting for a couple of hours. But when having a car a person can get to their event or job on time. Stated in Source 3 ""The day without cars is part of an improvent campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s."" Maybe if the United States started to start a campaign then maybe their wouldn't be so much smog in the air thats polluting the environment.

Also, in America many people would never give up their cars just for the looks. Stated in Source 4 ""But America's love affair withits vehicles seems to be cooling."" So i guess that would be a great start for the environment for America. But how long will America last with out a vehicles? From my point of view, not for long that's my opinion. Although, stated in Source 4"" Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question."" In my opinion i wouldn't take a bunch of kids on the train just to get to school or to a soccer game and then once that is all over with then have to get back on the train just to take tem back home. Anything can happen. That's why having cars have pro's and Con's. But others may think of the train ride as bonding time or just getting to know the full team better.

Stated in Source 3 ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the cityuneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic."" So having cars helps everyone a lot less accidents would happen and park and sports centers are making good profit. So now everyone could be happy and go on with their life. Stated in Source 4 "" With all these changes , people who stopped car cummuting as a result of the recession may find less reson to resume the habit..."" I would totally agree with these , because when u stop driving it means more money and better health.

Finally, cars should be limited for many reasons. Limiting car usage would many better health and less gas, and also less accidents on the road. Stated in Source 4 New York's new bikesharing program and its syrockiting bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new pririties."" Therefore many jobs aren't complainig about the less car usage and some people aren't complaining about it. Many people should stop using cars to help the environment out and to get into shape.",0
"Limiting car usage could greatly benefit the lifestyle of yourself and of those around you. Did you know that motor vehicles are one of the biggest causes of pollution and greenhouse emissions? According to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" If cars were completely eliminated for a week in an area like New York City, then pollution would be greatly lessened. It would be a good idea to try to take public transportation as often as possible, as opposed to driving to work every day.

Another good reason to limit car usage is to bring together community. There is a city in Germany by the name of Vauban according to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal, which completely bans driving cars. Inhabitants of this community walk or bike everywhere, which is also a good form of exercise that one could do in order to stay fit. The city was designed with walking in mind, and everything is close by as a result. If we were to have more of these communities, then green house emissions could be greatly lowered.

One major reason not to drive a car is that cars are often very expensive. If you live in an area where public transportation is an option, it may be worth it to not buy a car. You'd both help the environment and save a lot of money at the same time! If you're in a city or an area where many things are within walking distance, then you may also notice that there is a lot that you can do, such as walk to a mall or walk to a park, and you would not be harming the environment in any way.

Pollution is one major factor that should be touched upon more than once. According to a source named Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, ""after days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because of the large amount of people constantly driving, it caused the city to become so polluted that they had to ban people's ability to drive. If people carpooled more, or took more public transportation, then this wouldn't have happened. Some delivery companies even complained of ""lost revenue."" Lastly, it is a good idea not to drive because of the quickly depleting fuel supply remaining on our planet. Sooner or later, we will run out of gasses to fuel our vehicles with, and we won't have a backup plan. Some areas won't even be remotely affected by this, and people have already created hybrid and electrically powered vehicles. Perhaps if you were to bike more and get used to the idea of not driving, then you will be ready for the inevitable to occur. Although you don't have to cut cars out of your life completely, it's a good idea to start relying more on things that won't run out.

Overall, driving is fun and gets you to far places in much shorter times than it would take you if you walked there. However, there are many dangers and negative effects that come from driving. To recap, the green house gasses that come from cars are dangerous and harmful to our planet, and there should be efforts to lessen these gasses, even it is simply by car pooling or by taking public transportation. Also, people's excessive driving caused an entire city to have to ban driving vehicles.",0
"The using of cars has caused much of the worlds green house gas imitions, in America as much as 50% of the imitions are caused souly by transportation. Many people feel that this is destroying our atmosphere and that we should cut down on imitions by walking, biking or car pooling. Efforts to cut down keep our atmosphere clean and breathable. Some communities such as Vauban, Germany have illuminated car use entirely.

Vauban is a new experimental suburb where there is no street parking or driveways and the only place to park is in a garage where you must buy a space for 40,000 which has cut the car ownership rate down to only about 30%. There are as many as 5,500 residents in Vauban and most of them say they like it much better without having to worry about a car. In many suburbs however the houses are much to far apart for them to be carfree, though many areas are considering developments like this one so they can clean up the air.

Other cities, such as Paris, are forced to ban driving for days at a time in order to clear the thick smog that hovers above the city. On one day odd numbered plates won't be allowed to drive and on the next day even, volaters are fined 31. As many as 4,000 drivers are fined. Only once the smog was sufficiently cleared did they allow both plate types to drive. Limiting driving can prevent problems like this from occurring in all cities.

In Colombia they have a day where all cars are banned, chalanging the inhabitance to find alternate routs of travel for fear of the 25 fine for violators. The day without cars began in the mid1990's for Bogota, a city with a population of 7 million, has participated, but last year two other cities in Colombia joined in. Dispite the rainy weather many people still hiked or rode their bikes. Many citizens say that it keeps the cities air clear and that its nice to have a day without traffic jams filling the streets. The Day without cars is an event that many countries hope to adopt.

Studies show that many people from the newest generation aren't bothering to get a licence. Cell phones and apps make car pooling easy and the internet allows you to interact with friends without having to drive to visit them. Experts are hoping this trend will continue and that it will cut down the gas imitions. With increased use of social networking technology hopefully people will also become more aware of how they are affecting their planet and move to help others cut down as well.",0
"Driving is a way of getting around quicker and to get to places you need to go, ever since the first car was massproduced it has caused a social drift where now in this generation almost all people use a car to get anywhere. Driving is fun and is a helpful way, but imagine if you had to lower the amount of time you would spend in you car, it wouldnt be the end of the world the only negative effect of not using your car is taking more time to get there and exercising. A car releases fumes into the air which cuases air pollution, driving is one big reasons why we have global warming. According to researchers people in CarFree communities feel less stress without their cars, because having a car is a responsibilitybuying gas, not dentingscratching the car, and ofcourse keeping it clean. Driving is everywhere and has been here for awhile, driving has also sadly played a role in deaths across the nation, Driving under influence, foolishness, accidents and so on and so fourth. Maybe less driving isn't such a bad idea after all, there are already country that practice less car usage, even carfree days.

When you have a car its a whole new world and responsiblitys you will have and you'll have to maintain it, but driving is not the only way of getting around, there is running and bicycles and walking which are all healthy options, maybe next time we you need to go to the local store you can take a bike or run there yourself and save gas and lessen airpollution, ofcourse one trip without a car won't save the world but its a start. This generation is closely tied to using cars and most of them don't think that when they use a car the effects it has on using a car. Cars have been a great invention but now their starting to become a lifestyle. One of the common results of driving is traffic it is seen all over the place and takes up time and cuases stress among drivers, less driving would clear up the roads and lessen stress for others and be an open opportunity for others to get healthy.

Cars make up around 50% of greenhouse gas in the United States and cars are a nasty contributer to Global warming the fumes of the cars go in the air and get trapped there and hurt the ozone layer, also gasoline a source we find underground which we are using more and more than we get and it is a nonrenewable resource, we break down mountains just to find this resource. Oil has caused political disputes and the loss of forest,enviorments and more. When a car is destroyed it is sent to the scrapyard which is a big land just for destroyed cars and it takes up space, and it once could have been a nice forest. Car usage also is the producer of smog, sometimes smog is so bad in country they would have to ban carusage for a number of days that means we are abusing cars just a little too much.

Lastly, CarFree is not new or scaring it actually is a rising trend country have done CarFree day and the culture is spreading across the areas, being outside without a car using a bike or skateboard is a nice calm and relaxing way to spend a day and thousands of people seem to think so too, statistics say in the US the amount of cars being bought is slowly declining and driving less and the amount of licenses being optained is too. In some states there bike sharing programs and communities without cars. CarFree communties are a great way to save enviorment, lessen air pollution and to connect the community together instead of passing by taking a walk and or taking a bike ride with someone you would want to be with, and instead of hearing the constant sound of a motor engine hear the sound of children at play. Lessening carusage can save money, less stress, and make you view things in a different perspective or even CarPool so others don't have to use their cars.",0
"dear state senator, As you know America is very different from other countries. We are known as the land of the free, but then why cant we the people choose our president? The electoral college takes that right away from us. Americans have the right to vote so why would we be ignored and have our vote discarded. Many people dont agree with the electoral college system becase it strips people of their say and opinion in politics theres also the possibility of what people call a diastor factor. Despite it not being the best way to choose a president there are some pros to using the electoral college system, for instance runoff elections, where the amount of popular votes are too close or when ""no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast"" sited from source 3 but then again thats very rare.

The electoral college has someone voting in our places. A state representative cant say yes to all the candidates so why are they choosing for us we know who we want in office we as americans have a voice and a say in who is our leader. The amount of votes depends on how many people live in each state but ""because each state casts only one vote,the single representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, woud have as much say as the 55 representatives from california who represent 35 million voters"" as sited from source 2 with all representatives choosing the same candidate how can you expect them to reflect the will of the people?

disaster factors are the best argument againt the electoral college ""back in 1960 segragationists in the louisiana legislator nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john f kennedy so that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy "" thers also the fact that ""in the same vein and faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for whomever they please""as both sited from source 2 these disaster factors just prove how the electoral college can fail to choose a candidate fairly.

To summarize i would like to restate that the electoral college takes away americans freedom of choice,it also does not allow people to choose who they think would help benefit our country,and the chance of disaster factors it could brings into play.",0
"Cars have been used and started to rise since World War II. Vehicles have trended to make them fit our life and culture. But there has been so many tragic events taking place because of the use of cars and people debates whether cars should be used or not. It will be a great idea to limit cars because it will protect the environment, cut difficulties while on the road and improve safety and business.

Initially, it would be a great option to limit cars because it will protect the environment. Cars are used to make it easier to transport places but it does not help protect the world around. Cars cause damage to the whole atmosphere and can harm many. For instance, in Paris, people are fined for driving because of the smog polluted in the air. According to the passage ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. The use of driving vehicles can make it difficult to live in the world.

Furthermore, limiting the use of cars will be a big advantage to the world because it can cut difficulties while on the road. The less use of cars will lead to better circumstances while on the road. It will be easier for buses or delivery trucks to do their tasks quicker and more efficient. For example, in Bogota, many parks and sports centers have been replaced with smooth sidewalks which cut rush hour situations and traffic. The roads will be wider and more smooth for the environment.

Moreover, it would be a great idea to limit the use of cars because it will improve safety and business. Most instances when cars weren't used in different regions of the world, it led to the improvement of businesses but also better safety. In Vauban, having less placement for cars created more safety for customers to go into their desired place. It also has been more accessible and compact to public transportation. Limiting less cars progresses the world all around.

In conclusion, it will be a huge advantage to limit the use of cars because it will protect the environment, cut difficulties while on the road, and improve businesses and safety. Using less cars will not only protect ourselves but protect the world that we live in.",0
"Dear Senator, I am writing you to explain why the Electoral College system of choosing the president should be changed. The president should be chosen based on popular vote instead of the current system. The Electoral College system is unfair to certain states and somewhat confusing to others. I am certain that my views on this issue are not the only ones.

First off, the Electoral College system is unfair to states. Candidates for president don't spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning in. This is due to the Electoral College morphing the states into a winnertakesall system as said by the Office of the Federal register in ""What is the Electoral College?"". This means that the winning popular vote in each state wins the electoral vote for that state as well. The thing is, however the number of people voting compared to the number of electoral votes is unfair. I am aware that the number of electoral votes comes from the state's population, but imagine this California, which has 55 electoral votes gets visited by this tobepresident and wins it over only by a small margin. Wyoming, which has 3 electoral votes, doesn't get a visit by this candidate because he thinks that 55 votes is more important than three and a large majority of this state votes against him. The candidate then loses three electoral votes, but wins 55. Sounds like everything works out well right? Wrong. The other half of the voters in California combined with the majority of voters in Wyoming could have taken the vote if it weren't for the Electoral College. With popular vote the candidates would have to actually care about the states like Wyoming instead of ignoring them with Electoral College. With the popular vote system everyone has a say.

To continue, the Electoral College should be replace because of the confusion it causes. Most people believe that when they vote they are voting for president. However, what they dont know is that they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This slate of electors then votes for who they want to be president, and this might not always be the choice you want. With the popular vote system there would be no confusion and no voting on people who you want to vote for you. Do we really know who we're voting for? Or are we just going on luck? The reason why so many americans do not vote is because they think that even though they vote, they do not have a say on who's gonna win. With the popular vote system we could directly vote on who we belive to be the right choice for president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system should be replaced because with a popular vote system there would be fairness to all states and no confusion on who you're really voting on. With all of this said, I hope you consider my request and try to make a change.",0
"Cars have been a great way of transportation that has been around since the early days. It's a fast and simple way of getting to where you need to be at the right time. However, there are many downsides to cars, also, especially when it deals with environmental circumstances. Therefore, car use should be limited due the fact that limiting car use will reduce greenhouse gasses, conserve resources we need in order to live that is nonrenewable, and allows for communities to be more connected by preserving the environment.

To begin with, car usage is becoming a major issue for the world today due to pollution. Greenhouse gasses are being leaked into the atmosphere each day to cars' transmission fuels. According to Source 1, it states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" These gasses damage ecosystems, and leave many environments unstable due to its destruction. It can also effect human beings, also. According to Source 2, the passage says, ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" This pollution that is occurring around the world can damage our health if not taken care of. By limiting car usage, it would not only benefit the environment, but our health also.

Preceding on, along with the benefits of the environment and our health, limiting car usage will also save help save many resources we use in cars that is nonrenewable resources. Nonrenewable resources are resources that can not be replaced when it is used up. These resources are resources that are important to our every day lives, as we've gotten used to having these resources and would suffer without them. According to Source 2, it states, ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compares to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters."" Diesel is an important nonrenewable resource that we need that is causing pollution and smog in many places. By limiting the car usage, it would conserve these resources.

furthermore, limiting car usage would also help bring many communities together. If a whole community got together and decided to limit car usage with the whole community involved, it would give a sense of unity and benefit the community, also. An example of this was the residents of Vauban, Germany. In Source 1, the passage states ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Due to the limiting of driving cars, many people actually felt more of a sens of relief rather than with cars. In Source 3, it says, "" Bogota, Colombia In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoif of traffic jams. It was the third straight yeat cars have been permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" This community was able to come together as a whole in order to reach the goal of reducing smog and allowing for an alternative transportation method. By limiting car usage, communities are able to act more of a community rather than individuals.

All in all, limiting car usage would be beneficial to the world. The advantages of limiting car usage would be the reduction of greenhouse gasses and smog, the conservation of nonrenewable resources used in cars, and making communities stronger by coming together to stop the driving of cars. Cars are a big and major part of the world today, but it can be more beneficial to limit it rather than continue it.",0
"The Electoral College has been a part of America since the beginning, but is it fair? Our country is a Democracy, which means "" For the People"" or "" By the People"". The Electoral College is not By the People. Yes, it has historical value, but it no longer is what a Democracy is because of population changes and states being added to the country.

To begin with, Source 2 states "" The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state."" There is a popularity vote and then the Electoral College vote, most citizens think that the popularity vote will win because that candidate is the person that the people chose. That is not the case. It just depends on basically how big your state is and how popular a candidate is in that state. The population is the biggest factor that the candidates think about because if they win that state they are closer to winning the election. There are people who want to abolish the Electoral College including past presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. It really just isn't fair to the people that who they vote for and who wins the popular vote may not have a chance to win because heshe did not get the Electoral College votes.

In addition, Source 3 states "" The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electorss who vote for a president, no the people."" When you vote in your state you are actually voting for an electors and not the presidential candidate. In 2000 the popular vote was higher for Al Gore than it was for George Bush, but Bush won the presidential election because he had a higher number of electorss in the electorsal college. In a real democracy Gore would have won because of the fact he was more popular. The people want to vote directly for the candidate they want not for some person that has been trusted to vote for a party's nominee.

Finally, The Electoral College is kind of fair in a way because it is based off population in each state. There is also an equal number of electorss. Source 1 states "" The founding fathers established it the electorsal college in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" I understand that it is a law set by the men who created our country and it worked back then. It just isn't working in present day.

In conclusion, The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers back when the U.S. was small and didn't have a huge population like we do today. It worked back then, but now there are 50 states and millions of people. They want to be heard. The popular vote would make more sense than having states with huge populations deciding the fate of the election, when it should by popularity of the candidate. We need to restore our democracy and have the election be By the People.",0
"Since our beautiful country was born we've always used the Electoral College system to elect our presidents. It's time that we modify this old rule and change it to the popular vote, because it's simply unfair to all the hardworking people that leave work early and have to wait in line for hours to fill out a little white paper. The Electoral does not allow for everyone's voice to be heard. Clearly, the Electoral college must change to the popular vote because of the winner take all method, & the confusion.

To begin with, the Electoral college is outdated because of the winner take all system. Even if the votes are off by one, whichever partygoers the most popular votes gets all of the electoral votes the United States are basically saying everybody else's voice that voted doesn't matter. This winner takes all system also deals with population, the bigger the state the more electoral votes. This ancient system is clearly stating the citizens of the smaller states votes do not matter. Although, the winner take all method induces the candidates to focus on the toss up states, it's still unfair to everyone.

In addition, the Electoral college is irrational because of all of the confusion and trust issues. Many of the citizens in our country don't even know what an electoral college is! Plus the fact that most people think they're voting for the president, but in reality they're voting for the slate of electors. It's also possible the electors that represent your party votes for the other candidate! Another major reason the Electoral college must be abolished is because the citizens do not even get to choose their very own electors! It's like buying a new car while being blindfolded and believing the dealer the car runs fine. Everyone's going to have skepticism so they should at least let the citizens choose their own electors. Then again, the Electoral college avoids run off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral college was once a good idea for a starting country, but we now live in a elite dynasty that must have a few modifications on how the citizens elect their leader.",0
"Dear Senator, I heartily agree that we the people should keep the electoral College. Like you may already know, ""the ElectoralCcollege is a process, not a place."" Our founding fathers have made it, and as we look back into history, we realize that they were right about how a lot of things run in the U.S., so why should we question them now? Even we too as citizens know that they were right for making the Electoral College. As much as we aren't a citizen ruled society, we aren't a totalitarian society either.

A really good reason for having the Electoral College is simply recognized by saying that it kind of gives usthe citizens of America the ""power"" to vote for our president, rather than it being inherited, or voted upon solely by government officials, or some random process like in North Korea where Kim Jung Uun gets voted because he basically brainwashed his people into loving him. It gives us a certainty that we can chose the betterment for America. Also, though roughly half of the U.S. might agree, and the other half might disagree, you are entitled to your own opinion, and voting gives you the chance to show your opinion about whom you believe should be able to run our beautiful homeland as our trusted founding fathers once did, as president.

I'm sure that it has come to you that their are, in fact, several great reasons for allowing the Electoral college still run, but their is a couple of downsides. First off, the people within the Electoral College that vote for us citizens, don't vote for each individual person, they vote based upon who is voted the most in their relative area in whichever state their in, so the people don't all get their votes out. This could have turned several presidential elections around and helped the man or woman that lost in the election to win it.

After seeing the great pro's and the tiny con's, I'm sure your settled upon the opinion of holding on to the Electoral College,though you are entitled to your own opinion, you can't deny the facts.",0
"The Electoral College, good or bad? Many may feel that the Electoral College has more downs than ups, but thats not always the case. I feel that despite these common views we should keep the electoral college due to the fact that popular vote may not always be the best way.

There have been multiple instances in which the electoral college has saved many elections due to the fact that the popular vote was too close. This ""college"" consists of multiple slates of electors. These electors are really who we vote for when we vote for president. Every states including the District of Columbia are allocated a certain amount of electors. These electors then vote for whoever won the popular vote in that state despite the other sides views. This is called a ""winnertakeall"" system. Yet there are two states, Maine and Nebraska, that have a ""proportional representation"" system. When it is done the governor creates a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which basically is the official way of declaring who in that state won the vote.

The Electoral College is more good then bad due to the fact that it has saved instances of a tight vote. The Electoral College does require the presidential candidates to abide by some rules. One of which is making the candidate focus on other areas rather than the region they know they will win the vote in. Another like i have been talking about is the outcome, it enables a balance that should be kept between the popular votes. It is also another way like the two houses of Congress where it keeps the balance of political choice between big states and small states. It also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

Now many may find it that the electoral college are beings from a bottomless pit because of the year 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush with Al Gore winning with over 60% of the popular vote. This is most likely due to the reason why he mmay have stretched out all of his visits between the states. He may have won more popular votes in total than Bush but he may have appealed to a minority of people in each state so the overall of the state wanted Bush. Some say the best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor. Just because some may choose not to vote for the person they are supposed to doesnt mean that the entire college is bad. These things are going to happen with people who think differently. Just because someone may think McDonald's is nasty and they refuse to go are you going to not go because they don't? This happens in everything we do we are only human, we are different, not everyone thinks in the same way. When we do it is a recipe for disaster.

So, in my opinion, we must keep the electoral college if we want to keep the balance in everything the US stands for, politically and demographically. These are facts that should not be ignored, just because some see differently doesn't mean we have to change the foundation of our society.",0
"I have been burdened with the fact that our nation's president is not decided by us but rather by a slate of electors who we vote for. I sincerely feel this is unfair to the people of the U.S.There are many reasons to be against this its hard to choose, but I'll give you my three best ones. The slate of electors could change their political views, the decision for our president is not decided by us insteadby other people and their views ,but most of all its unfair to most states because the candidates only worry about the swing states.

To begin with the slate of electors we choose could change their political views. In the world we live in nothing is certain so if we choose a slate of electors whats stoping them from changeing their view on politics. This problem makes it harder to choose a slate of electors because you are putting your trust in them to represent you, and they can change their views. However ifthe people got to decide their views would be represented by themselves so at least they know their vote counts and it wont be changed. This also takes away the worry of their vote changeing because they themselves voted. And this in the end will give you the president that most people need. So this is one potent reason to abolish the electoral college.

Moreover the president being decided by thers and their viewsis another significant reason to end the electoral college. This country was made to be a nation made by the people,for the people,and by the people.

So if our vote is decided by others that aspect is destroyed. Also if there is a tie in the electoral college the house of representatives decides who is president. The decision will be made by the house of representatives views on politics so you are giving them more power than the people. So the electoral college should be destroyed and the people should decide the outcome. This will let the voice of the people to be heard.

Last but not least most states wont ever even see the candidates because they mainly focus on the swing states. This means that most states wont see the candidates. And if the electoral college is abolished people wont feel left out and they will know that their vote mattered. This will make people feel like their still part of the nation and that their not left out. Also the candidates foccusing on the swing states truly isn't fair to the states with little votes in the college. And that is why the electoral college should be destroyed. And then after this is done the non swing states will feel important.

To concludeI sincerely feel the electoralis unfair to the people of the U.S. There are many reasons to be against this it washard to choose, but Igave you my three best ones. The slate of electors could change their political views, the decision for our president is not decided by us insteadby other people and their views ,but most of all its unfair to most states because the candidates only worry about the swing states.",0

"Limited car usage has plenty of advantages. A few examples of advantages that come from limited car usage are lessening the amount of gases polluting the air, also it would create a friendly and neighborly environment, and a large amount of money would be saved.

To limit car usage has huge benefits we can lessen the gasses that are polluted, lessening smog. It may not sound like something that effects your everyday life, but it does. Smog and air pollution are a problem, and a threat to our safety and well being. As of right now it is'nt a life or death situation, but if car usage continues to be a huge part of the world, all the air pollution from all the years of driving are going to get so bad people, and the earths atmosphere will be extremely affected by it. Think about your kids future, would you really want them to live in a world consumed by air pollution, and emission gasses, and smog.. To give an example, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states"" rosenthal. That just showing how much car usage affects air pollution and the air we breath everyday. Just decreasing the amount of car usage can reduce the smog, and air pollution in cities and towns.

Additionally, the less cars are used the more people and neighbors would interact. If a majority of a town just lessened the amount they go out using a car, they would walk, or ride bikes, or take busses, etc.. imagine your town, and families and their kids taking a walk somewhere, or people riding their bicycles to their destination, everyone could meet their neighbors and talk. Overall, cities and towns and suburban areas would generally become just a friendly environment. Most people want to live in a place in which they feel safe and neighborly. Teenagers and families would get more excersise then the normal. Due to having to walk, and ride bikes or other things they would be getting out of the house more instead of sitting in a car then going and sitting some place then going back home and sitting around again, they would get the needed physical activity to stay some what healthy. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day""selsky. That is amazing, and it is so good for people to get out and do things like that. Lessening car usage could completly change neighborhoods and towns and citiies.

Finally, Cars in the united states are highly expensive, and not everyone has thousands of dollars around to get the car they wantneed. ""Cash strapped americans could not afford new cars""Rosenthal. Just an example that cars are not cheap and a lot of people spend money they do not have on cars. In addition to buying the car, gas must be provided, depending on the car and the amount of gas it uses up, that can be pretty expensive. Insurance is another cost, everyone has to have insurance to be able to drive and own a car, thats a monthly fee coming out of our pockets. Limiting car usage could save a lot of money, it would leave extra money every day, week or month to go out and eat once in a while, or to buy other necisities. Just about everyone wants to have a little extra money, but with a car thats frequently used can use up almost 200 to 400 dollars each month. Riding a bike, or skateboarding or just simply walking is completly free.

Advantages in limited car usage are, The decrease in gas pollution and smog, it could create friendlier neighborhoods and towns, and lastly thousands of people would save a lot of money.",0
"Hello, my name is PROPER_NAME, a freshman at SCHOOL_NAME. It is much appreciated that you took time out of your busy schedule to read this. This letter is in regards to the Electoral College. There have been many ongoing disputes on whether or not we should keep the Electoral College in order to elect the President. It is felt that the Electoral College is not the way to go when it comes to voting for the President. The reasons being for this is that the Electoral College doesn't truly represent the people, and it doesn't allow everyone to know the true facts about each candidate.

First of all, the Electoral College does not represent everyone truly. The Electoral College is overall risky. It is stated by Bradford Plumer from the passage, ""The Indefensible Electoral College..."" , that there were several incidents regarding corrupt electors whom did not fulfill the popular vote of their state. He stated the incident in the 1960's, when the Louisiana legislature almost replaced Democratic electors, in order to not have the popular vote go to Kennedy. Electors can also choose who to vote for and have no care in who the general public votes for. Why risk giving your voice to people who are shady, untrustworthy, and won't care for your opinion? Furthermore, in the passage of ""What Is the Electoral College?"" , that most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system. However, in Maine and Nebraska, they use a system similar to ""proportional representation"". Why would the USA need this in order to choose a President? Why can't things all be the same?

Secondly, the Electoral College does not give everyone a chance to know the candidates a little better. In the passage, ""In Defense of the Electoral College:..."" , he states that candidates focus more on swing states instead of all of the states in general. This strategy creates a problem for those who want to listen and get to know who the candidates are, but live in states that don't get visited. Which in turn, doesn't allow the general public to get to know who they are. Another problem is that when the popular vote is lost in a state, those who lost no longer have a say in the election. Why have your vote squandered to the majority when you can have a direct election that will always give you a voice in your country?

To conclude, the Electoral College isn't the greatest way to pick a President. The Electoral College should be abolished for it does not always honestly voice the general public, and does not give everyone to the same opportunity to understand a candidate's motives. The Electoral College may give a clear winner and is less timeconsuming, but are we working towards a speedy election? Or towards what the people want? Over 60 percent of registered voters prefer a direct election. Which would you prefer Mr.",0
